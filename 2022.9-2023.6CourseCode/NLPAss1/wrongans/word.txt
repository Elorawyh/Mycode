 Gold
SAN FRANCISCO  It has never been easy to have a rational conversation about the value of gold
Lately with gold prices up more than  over the last decade it is harder than ever
Just last December fellow economists Martin Feldstein and Nouriel Roubini each penned opeds bravely questioning bullish market sentiment sensibly pointing out gold risks
Wouldn you know it
Since their articles appeared the price of gold has moved up still further
Gold prices even hit a recordhigh  recently
Last December many gold bugs were arguing that the price was inevitably headed for 
Now emboldened by continuing appreciation some are suggesting that gold could be headed even higher than that
One successful gold investor recently explained to me that stock prices languished for a more than a decade before the Dow Jones index crossed the  mark in the early 
Since then the index has climbed above 
Now that gold has crossed the magic  barrier why can it increase tenfold too
Admittedly getting to a much higher price for gold is not quite the leap of imagination that it seems
After adjusting for inflation today price is nowhere near the alltime high of January 
Back then gold hit  or well over  in today dollars
But January  was arguably a reak peak during a period of heightened geopolitical instability
At  today price is probably more than double very longterm inflationadjusted average gold prices
So what could justify another huge increase in gold prices from here
One answer of course is a complete collapse of the US dollar
With soaring deficits and a rudderless fiscal policy one does wonder whether a populist administration might recklessly turn to the printing press
And if you are really worried about that gold might indeed be the most reliable hedge
Sure some might argue that inflationindexed bonds offer a better and more direct inflation hedge than gold
But gold bugs are right to worry about whether the government will honor its commitments under more extreme circumstances
In fact as Carmen Reinhart and I discuss in our recent book on the history of financial crises This Time is Different cashstrapped governments will often forcibly convert indexed debt to nonindexed debt precisely so that its value might be inflated away
Even the United States abrogated indexation clauses in bond contracts during the Great Depression of the 
So it can happen anywhere
Even so the fact that very high inflation is possible does not make it probable so one should be cautious in arguing that higher gold prices are being driven by inflation expectations
Some have argued instead that gold long upward march has been partly driven by the development of new financial instruments that make it easier to trade and speculate in gold
There is probably some slight truth  and also a certain degree of irony  to this argument
After all medieval alchemists engaged in what we now consider an absurd search for ways to transform base metals into gold
Wouldn it be paradoxical then if financial alchemy could make an ingot of gold worth dramatically more
In my view the most powerful argument to justify today high price of gold is the dramatic emergence of Asia Latin America and the Middle East into the global economy
As legions of new consumers gain purchasing power demand inevitably rises driving up the price of scarce commodities
At the same time emergingmarket central banks need to accumulate gold reserves which they still hold in far lower proportion than do richcountry central banks
With the euro looking less appetizing as a diversification play away from the dollar gold appeal has naturally grown
So yes there are solid fundamentals that arguably support today higher gold price although it is far more debatable whether and to what extent they will continue to support higher prices in the future
Indeed another critical fundamental factor that has been sustaining high gold prices might prove far more ephemeral than globalization
Gold prices are extremely sensitive to global interestrate movements
After all gold pays no interest and even costs something to store
Today with interest rates near or at record lows in many countries it is relatively cheap to speculate in gold instead of investing in bonds
But if real interest rates rise significantly as well they might someday gold prices could plummet
Most economic research suggests that gold prices are very difficult to predict over the short to medium term with the odds of gains and losses being roughly in balance
It is therefore dangerous to extrapolate from shortterm trends
Yes gold has had a great run but so too did worldwide housing prices until a couple of years ago
If you are a highnetworth investor a sovereign wealth fund or a central bank it makes perfect sense to hold a modest proportion of your portfolio in gold as a hedge against extreme events
But despite gold heightened allure in the wake of an extraordinary runup in its price it remains a very risky bet for most of us
Of course such considerations might have little influence on prices
What was true for the alchemists of yore remains true today gold and reason are often difficult to reconcile

Is Iraq the Next Afghanistan
At the onset of the USled war in Iraq two competing views shaped predictions about the outcome
The first contended that overthrowing Saddam Husseins regime would usher in a democratic era in Iraq that would serve as a model and catalyst for democratic change regionally
Derided by detractors as a new domino theory this view presented intervention in Iraq as similar to Americas role in postWWII Japan
Against the optimism of that Japan scenario pessimists argued that a Somalia scenario was more likely
They staked their claim on the tribal sectarian and multiethnic nature of Iraq which in the absence of dictatorship would supposedly incite Iraqs collapse into a failed state with rampant warlordism ethnic and religious feuds and harboring of terrorist organizations
But the main question now is whether Iraq will drift along lines somewhere between these two scenarios increasingly resembling Afghanistan
This Afghan scenario implies a weak state with nominal power over effectively autonomous fiefdoms that are headed by strongmen who are represented in the central government
Bad as it sounds this prospect appears to be a realistic compromise between the supposedly utopian vision of a flourishing unified democracy and the wretchedness of a failed state
Many of the actions and policies of the Coalition Provisional Authority CPA as well as higherlevel Bush administration decisions seem to point to a resigned acceptance that early hopes that Iraq would embrace Westernstyle democracy were misplaced
Indeed such hopes were misplaced
Iraqs political culture  and that of most of the Middle East  is incompatible with the basic components of a recognizable Westernstyle democracy notions of individual rights and responsibilities are lacking the concept of a patriarchal state is deeply rooted and individual cultural identity is rarely tied to the national community
On the other hand much circular logic figures in analyses that consider the traditional nature of Iraqi society an obstacle to liberal democracy
For these analyses are hardly neutral but unwittingly enter an ongoing confrontation
In Iraq as elsewhere in the Arab and Muslim worlds a cultural war is being waged between two paradigms grand narratives that accept and promote a collectivistic understanding nationalism socialism Islamism versus an implicit paradigm of individualistic modernity that is locally rooted yet informed by the global experience
The frontlines of this war are notions of the individual cultural identity civil society and the nationstate
The religious Islamic component in Iraqi social life should not be underestimated
But it also should not be equated with the political Islamism that strives to capitalize on it
Nationalist and leftist political discourses did leave an imprint on the Iraqi value system but they are not its sole components
Indeed the nominal acceptance of grand narratives of democracy and human rights as common bases for political discourse represents a crucial shift in demarcating the cultural battle
This cultural debate is not limited to the Arab scene
There are also vigorous discussions in the West about the applicability of democratic institutions to the Arab context
Advocates of the notion of Arab exceptionalism which questions the ability of Arab societies to adapt democratic systems are in fact objectively allied with grand narrative ideologues  and also with the beneficiaries of the Arab worlds patronagebased political order
The models used in the West both in political circles and in academia for the analysis and interpretation of Arab societies are seriously deficient
In particular many analyses nowadays promote an ethnic model reducing Iraq to an artificial construct that rests atop a fragmented reality of separate communities
Some have even suggested hastening the outcome predicted by this faulty view by dividing Iraq into its genuine original components Sunni Shii and Kurd
In fact Iraqi society is more complex than this
The reception and adoption of democracy is not a function of sectarian belonging but a reflection of the multidimensional historical cultural religious and political identities of Iraqi individuals
Given the right circumstances it is eminently possible to mobilize Iraqi society towards a democratic formulation of its statetobe
The fall of Saddam ushers in the right circumstances
Indeed the seeming failure of a recognizable democratic core to emerge in Iraq within the first few months of the collapse of Saddams dictatorship is due more to idiosyncrasies of the process than to any presumed essential nature of Iraqi society
Upon Saddams fall a large middle ground existed in Iraq that was positively disposed towards democratic discourse and practice
Policy mistakes and reversals eroded this middle ground opening a path for ideological Islamism and a reconstituted neoBaathism
The key mistake was the failure of occupation forces to equip and empower the small group of Iraqi liberal democratic figures to tap into this middle ground
As a result the space for a liberal democratic outcome receded
But to treat this setback as a failure would be a selffulfilling prophecy
Iraqi democrats must reassess and develop a clear public strategy
The CPA and the world community must not prejudice the outcome of their efforts by accepting a facile and bogus view of Iraqi society
Even if such efforts succeed the road to a fullfledged democratic system in Iraq will still be arduous and expensive
But instead of succumbing to a Somalia scenario dreaming of a Japan scenario or settling for an Afghanistan scenario Iraq may yet become a scenario for successful intervention in the  st century
eoOttoman Turkey
ANKARA  Nowadays the international media are obsessed with the question of who ost Turkey and what that supposed loss means for Europe and the West
More alarmingly some commentators liken Turkey neighborhood policy to a revival of Ottoman imperialism
Recently a senior Turkish columnist went so far as to quote Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutolu as saying that e are indeed neoOttoman
As someone who was present when Davutolu made his presentation to the parliamentary faction of Turkey ruling Justice and Development Party AKP I can attest to the fact that he did not use such terminology
In fact Davutolu and all of us in the AKP foreignpolicy community never use this term because it is simply a mispresentation of our position
Turkey neighborhood policy is devised to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighborhoods including the Balkans the Black Sea the Caucasus the Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean
We aim to deepen our political dialogue increase our trade and multiply our peopletopeople contacts with our neighbors in the form of sports tourism and cultural actvities
When Egon Bahr formulated his Ostpolitik in the  no one asked Will Brandt whether Germany was lost
God bestowed upon Turkey a geographical position that fundamentally requires for us to engage with East and West North and South
This is neither a choice nor a luxury  it is a necessity
The symbol of the Byzantine and the Seluk Empires which occupied roughly the same geography that Turkey does today was a doubleheaded eagle looking both east and west
It should be no wonder that Turkey is also seeking to engage both ends of its territories and feels that its security is best consolidated by minimizing risks together with its neighbors
So we find the current debate on Turkey orientation rather superflous and in some cases illintentioned
Our neighborhood policy needs support not criticism
Turkey has become an invaluable asset in the makeup of our surrounding regions and is already changing the status quo in favor of more stability and predictability
Our efforts at normalization with Armenia for example are destined to bring change to the entire South Caucasus
We are doing our part in terms of burdensharing
Sensible Europeans understand that
To be sure some of our neighbors are difficult
But no country has the luxury of choosing its neighbors
Turkey neighborhood policy is very realistic based on genuine interests not some romantic neoOttoman nostagia as more than a few international commentators have suggested
True there is a neoOttoman revival in the cultural field and our citizens are eager to rediscover Ottoman life culture and practices
As Turkey is normalizing domestically it is also reinterpreting its national historical narrative
This is a natural byproduct of consolidating our democracy
However trying to paint our carefully constructed foreignpolicy initiatives with imperialist overtones is not only a stark mispresentation but also does gross injustice to our wellintentioned efforts to stabilize our region
In Roman mythology Janus was the god of gates doorways beginnings and endings
Turkey today is a Januslike geography that offers gates and doorways to the East and West
It offers beginnings and endings to the Caucasus the Black Sea the Balkans and the Mediterranean
In this capacity Turkey complements and contributes to a unique transitional passage between otherwise difficult regions for it signifies centuriesold coexistence and adjustment
Turkish foreign policy contributes to that coming together and helps its immeditate neighborhoods to connect with one another
Contrary to recent charges Turkey foreign policymakers are not seeking to revive the Ottoman Empire
Instead we seek Turkey historic reintegration into its immediate neighborhoods thereby correcting an anomaly of the Cold War years
Such reintegration would only benefit the European Union and our other Western NATO allies
None of them therefore has any reason to express discomfort with Turkey
errorists at Home
NEW YORK  Last week I submitted an affidavit to support an important lawsuit brought by reporter Chris Hedges and others including Daniel Ellsberg and Noam Chomsky against US President Barack Obama and his defense secretary Leon Panetta
The lawsuit seeks to stop implementation of the horrific new National Defense Authorization Act also known as the omeland Battlefield Bill which Obama signed into law in December
As a result the United States government ar on terror has come home any American may now be detained indefinitely without charge or trial anywhere at any time forever
As Hedges wrote recently in a chilling explication of why he is bringing the lawsuit the NDAA rucial phrases are ubstantially supported and ssociated forces
These two phrases he argues allow the government to expand the definition of terrorism to include groups that were not involved in the terrorist attacks of September   and that may not even have existed when those attacks took place
According to Hedges he law can be used to detain individuals who are not members of terrorist organizations but have provided in the words of the bill substantial support even to ssociated forces
As Hedges points out neither of these terms is properly specified nor does the law define an act of terror or the activities of those purportedly ngaged in hostilities against the United States
As Hedges puts it his is why especially as acts of civil disobedience proliferate the NDAA law is so terrifying
He is absolutely right and his deposition details how the NDAA and similar legislation is being used to obstruct his investigations and intimidate him personally
He describes being detained by US officials while reporting overseas and being advised that he is on a watch list
He also understands as few US reporters do how similar legislation has been used to terrorize and intimidate reporters in other countries
Hedges a former reporter for The New York Times witnessed this in El Salvador
But almost identical laws have been used to impede reporting and news publishing and to harass intimidate and even imprison journalists in fascist Italy in early Nazi Germany in the former Soviet Union and under military rule in Chile Argentina and Ecuador
On March  I joined supporters of the lawsuit in a New York City courtroom to determine if the plaintiffs would be granted legal standing to challenge the government planned actions
Katherine OBrien another journalist detailed her own intimidation by a selfidentified Federal agent and the cofounder of Occupy London Kai Wargalla produced a memo from the London Police categorizing her group as errorists
The hearing crescendo was tough questioning of the government lawyers by Federal Judge Katherine B Forrest who repeatedly asked the government lawyers to define the terms ubstantially supported and ssociated forces which she did not receive despite restating her question seven or eight times
We now have it from the US government lawyers own mouths this law may put journalists at risk or at least the lawyers explicitly refuse to rule out that option for their client  and as Forrest put it they have ne very big clientorrest also repeatedly asked for assurances  at least five times  that the NDAA would not sweep up people like the plaintiffs journalists engaged in journalism and citizens engaged in peaceful protest
Again every time the lawyers for Obama and Panetta said that they could not give her such assurances
At the end of April the two sides will present new briefs and she will announce the next stage of the process after she deliberates over the new material
Vaguely defined terms are a standard part of the totalitarian toolkit and they always begin as Hedges notes with legislation that subverts the rule of law by enabling the arbitrary exercise of power
Such terms always ensnare early on reporters editors and newspaper publishers with threats that they are jeopardizing ational security or by reporting on them showing upport for outlawed and nefarious forces
My own affidavit agrees with Hedges argument that US reporters are already modifying their behavior in response to such laws  and to frightening recent examples that have been made of controversial publishers like WikiLeaks Julian Assange
I detail examples of stories that I myself did not pursue because of the official intimidation that these laws represent a decision not to meet with released Guantnamo prisoners in London or to showcase fundraising for an important documentary about the bombardment of civilians in Gaza
There was also a very painful recent decision  legally unavoidable but one that made me feel as a journalist dishonorable and ashamed  not to pursue a proposed facetoface encounter with Assange while he was under house arrest near Cambridge
I know that many other US reporters are making similar decisions as a result of the NDAA and I hope that they join this lawsuit whether with affidavits of their own or as plaintiffs
Such laws make otherwise conscientious reporters hesitate to do what is professionally right
It is not just American reporting that suffers when a law such as the NDAA threatens journalists and editors
With US legislation and claims of executive authority increasingly giving US presidents the power to wage wars declare all of America a battlefield assassinate US citizens and noncitizens around the world hold Afghanis Iraqis and Pakistanis indefinitely without charge or trial and accuse Australian publishers of espionage the rest of the world needs fearless and accurate American reporting
That is the first step toward holding US leaders accountable under domestic and international law
Unfortunately such accountability is needed now more than ever

Why Wait for the Euro
Although the EUs eastward enlargement has not yet happened the debate is already shifting to ask what will follow when should the new predominantly postcommunist members adopt the euro
Assuming that they comply with the Maastricht Treatys provisions concerning the EMU  and are not unfairly held to more stringent criteria  the core issue is whether new members would benefit more by waiting or whether they should seek early entry 
At the outset it must be stressed that in seeking earlier entry into the EMU a country assumes a more ambitious fiscal and structural program than would be needed if EMU membership is delayed
Early entry otherwise would be an empty gesture 
I believe that early adoption of the euro is not only possible but preferable to delay
By early adoption I mean the shortest permissible period of time  two years  following a new member subordinating its monetary policy to the fiscal and monetary constraints of the exchange rate mechanism ERM II
Assuming entry into both the EU and ERM II in  new members should aim to enter the eurozone around  
Is this realistic
Well most candidate countries have already achieved a high degree of structural convergence with the EU
Exports to the Union have soared since  when the collapse of the Sovietera COMECON trading system forced a radical reorientation of trade  helped by massive foreign investment from the EU  towards Western markets
Most accession candidates now send more exports to the EU than Greece Portugal and Spain did when they entered the EU and EMU 
Progress on disinflation is similarly impressive
Annual inflation in most candidate countries has fallen to   not much higher than in many EU countries and lower than in The Netherlands last year
As with structural convergence EU candidates already outperform Spain Portugal and Greece at a comparable time before their EMU debut
Nor is there much risk of large future corrective price swings because all but a few prices are completely liberalized 
Theoretical studies suggest that inflation in the accession countries will remain stubbornly higher than the Maastricht Treaty allows
The culprit in this pessimistic view is the socalled BalassaSamuelson effect rapid productivity growth in the accession candidates tradable sectors  export manufacturing for example  is pushing up real wages throughout their economies including in nontradable sectors like services
This overall rise in real wages in the face of lower productivity growth for the service sector boosts relative prices and keeps inflation above the eurozone average 
The BalassaSamuelson effect is still evident in Greece Spain and Portugal
But as empirical research prepared by the CEC National Banks estimates its contribution to total price growth in the candidate countries is 
With the BalassaSamuelson effect so subdued and limited scope for future corrective inflation the EMU criterion regarding price stability  of annual inflation within  of the average rate for the three bestperforming economies in the EU  is within reach 
But is early admission to EMU preferable to postponing membership
From the standpoint of current member states would admitting Hungary Latvia Poland or Slovakia sooner rather than later drag down the euro as many fear 
Fears that extending EMU to new states too soon would undermine the euros external exchange rate are irrational
If all candidate countries join the EU at around the same time they will together account for a mere  of its total GDP
So any negative impact on the euro from rapid accession to EMU would at worst amount to little more than a rounding error 
Delaying entry into EMU could make sense if a longer wait produced more information
But a wait of greater length might produce nothing but added noise
Equally the transition period is already turbulent with convergencedriven capital flows driving up exchange rates and complicating monetary policy in several candidate countries including Poland the Czech Republic and Hungary
Indeed capitalflow volatility could make short work of the flexible exchange rate on offer under ERM II  a  fluctuation band either side of a central parity 
Some argue that ERM II membership should be viewed as a longerterm proposition  possibly lasting until   for the benefit of candidates themselves
The benefit is simple ERM II permits some exchange rate flexibility as opposed to the fixed rates implied by adopting the euro
This would help keep the candidates economic output high and thus sustain real convergence with average EU income levels 
This is an exceptionally weak argument and a politically suspect one too
As European Central Bank data shows average per capita GDP in the accession candidates is  of the eurozone level
The size of the income gap combines with the small growth differentials to imply that the process of real convergence will extend far beyond even the most cautious dates for EU and EMU entry probably lasting several decades
More important longlasting economic growth does not depend on the type of exchange rate  whether flexible or fixed EMU  while early accession will speed up crucial reforms 
A few years of limited exchange rate flexibility is a poor substitute for rapid completion of structural reforms
In almost all candidates further disinflation and longterm economic growth require fiscal consolidation more flexible labor markets and completion of privatization
Delaying EMU entry risks weakening the incentive to complete these politically costly but necessary reforms 
Any delay in completing reforms will ultimately slow the process of real convergence that EU officials rightly hold dear
Early adoption by contrast would be more conducive to these reforms and thus to real convergence
Success here would allow candidate countries to start reaping the benefits of greater price transparency reduced transaction costs and a solid macroeconomic framework
This strategy not one of deferred entry promises the most for both the EUs current and its future members 
ur Islamists
NEW DELHI  Following the death of Libya Muammar elQaddafi Libya interim government announced the iberation of the country
It also declared that a system based on sharia Islamic law including polygamy would replace the secular dictatorship that Qaddafi ran for  years
Swapping one form of authoritarianism for another seems a cruel letdown after seven months of NATO airstrikes in the name of democracy
In fact the Western powers that brought about regime change in Libya have made little effort to prevent its new rulers from establishing a theocracy
But this is the price that the West willingly pays in exchange for the privilege of choosing the new leadership
Indeed the cloak of Islam helps to protect the credibility of leaders who might otherwise be seen as foreign puppets
For the same reason the West has condoned the rulers of the oil sheikhdoms for their longstanding alliance with radical clerics
For example the decadent House of Saud backed by the United States not only practices Wahhabi Islam  the source of modern Islamic fundamentalism  but also exports this fringe form of the faith gradually snuffing out more liberal Islamic traditions
Yet when the Saudi Crown Prince died recently the US stood by silently as the ruling family appointed its most reactionary Islamist as the new heir to the throne
So intrinsic have the Arab monarchs become to US interests that the Americans have failed to stop these cloistered royals from continuing to fund Muslim extremist groups and madrasas in other countries
From Africa to South and Southeast Asia Arab petrodollars have played a key role in fomenting militant Islamic fundamentalism that targets the West Israel and India as its enemies
The US interest in maintaining pliant regimes in oilrich countries trumps all other considerations
With Western support the oil monarchies even the most tyrannical have been able to ride out the Arab Spring emerging virtually unscathed
For the US the sheikhdoms that make up the Gulf Cooperation Council  Saudi Arabia Kuwait Bahrain Qatar the United Arab Emirates and Oman  are critical for geostrategic reasons as well
After withdrawing its forces from Iraq the US is considering using Kuwait as a new military hub to expand its military presence in the Persian Gulf region and foster a USled ecurity architecture under which its air and naval patrols would be regionally integrated
NATOled regime change in Libya  which holds the world largest reserves of the light sweet crude oil that American and European refineries prefer  was not really about ushering in an era of liberal democracy
The new Libya faces uncertain times
The only certain element is that its new rulers will remain beholden to those who helped to install them
US Senator John McCain has already announced that the new Libyan rulers are illing to reimburse us and our allies for the costs of effecting regime change
America troubling ties with Islamist rulers and groups were cemented in the  when the Reagan administration used Islam as an ideological tool to spur armed resistance to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan
In  at a White House ceremony attended by several Afghan mujahideen  the jihadists out of which the Taliban and alQaeda evolved  Reagan gestured toward his guests and declared hese gentlemen are the moral equivalent of America Founding Fathers
Yet the lessons of the antiSoviet struggle in Afghanistan have already been forgotten including the need to focus on longterm goals rather than shortterm victories
The Obama administration current effort to strike a Faustian bargain with the Taliban for example ignores America own experience of the consequences of following the path of expediency
Another lesson that has been ignored is the need for caution in training Islamic insurgents and funneling lethal arms to them to help overthrow a regime
In Libya bringing the myriad rebel militias under government control is likely to prove difficult potentially creating a jihadist citadel at Europe southern doorstep
Exponents of US policy argue that in war it is sometimes necessary to choose the lesser of two evils
Unsavory allies  ranging from Islamist militias to regimes that bankroll militant Islamic fundamentalism overseas  may be an unavoidable price to be paid in the service of larger interests
Paradoxically the US practice of propping up malleable Islamist rulers in the Middle East often results in strong antiUS sentiment as well as support for more independent and uthentically Islamist forces
When elections are held it is such autonomous Islamists who often emerge as winners as in Gaza and Tunisia
The fight against Islamist terrorism can succeed only by ensuring that states do not strengthen those forms of Islamic fundamentalism that extol violence as a religious tool
Unfortunately with the US willfully ignoring the lessons of the recent past the extremists are once again waiting in the wings
 or 
PARIS  As the economic crisis deepens and widens the world has been searching for historical analogies to help us understand what has been happening
At the start of the crisis many people likened it to  or  which was reassuring because both dates refer to classical cyclical downturns
Today the mood is much grimmer with references to  and  beginning to abound even if some governments continue to behave as if the crisis was more classical than exceptional
The tendency is either excessive restraint Europe or a diffusion of the effort the United States
Europe is being cautious in the name of avoiding debt and defending the euro whereas the US has moved on many fronts in order not to waste an ideal opportunity to implement badly needed structural reforms
For geostrategists however the year that naturally comes to mind in both politics and economics is 
Of course the fall of the house of Lehman Brothers has nothing to do with the fall of the Berlin Wall
Indeed on the surface it seems to be its perfect antithesis the collapse of a wall symbolizing oppression and artificial divisions versus the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and reassuring institution of financial capitalism
Yet  like  may very well correspond to an epochal change whose unfolding consequences will be felt for decades
The end of the EastWest ideological divide and the end of absolute faith in markets are historical turning points
And what happens in  may jeopardize some of the positive results of  including the peaceful reunification of Europe and the triumph of democratic principles over nationalist if not xenophobic tendencies
In  liberal democracy triumphed over the socialist ideology incarnated and promoted by the Soviet Bloc
For many of his supporters it was President Ronald Reagan who with his deliberate escalation of the arms race pushed the Soviet economy to the brink thereby fully demonstrating the superiority of liberal societies and free markets
Of course there are obvious differences between  and now
First and perhaps above all the revolutions of  and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union put an end to global bipolarity
By contrast  is likely to pave the way to a new form of bipolarity but with China substituting for the Soviet Union
Second whereas democracy and market capitalism appeared as clear  if more fragile than expected  winners in  it is difficult in  with the spread of the global crisis to distinguish winners from losers
Everyone seems to be a loser even if some are more affected than others
Yet history is unfair and the US despite its greater responsibility for today global crisis may emerge in better shape than most countries from the morass
In better shape but not alone
As a visiting professor at Harvard and MIT I am getting a good preview of what the world could look like when the crisis finally passes
One senses something like the making of an AmericanAsian dominated universe
From the incredible media lab at MIT to the mathematics and economics departments at Harvard Asians  Chinese and Indians in particular  are everywhere like the Romans in Athens in the first century BC full of admiration for those from whom they were learning so much and whom they would overcome in the coming decades
But before this new order appears the world may be faced with spreading disorder if not outright chaos
What for example will happen to a country as central and vulnerable as Egypt when hundred of thousands of Egyptians working in the Gulf are forced to return to their homeland as a result of the crisis in the oilproducing countries
When the rich get less rich the poor get poorer
And what about the foreign workers who have reached for the uropean dream and are now faced with potential explosions of xenophobia in Europe supposedly open countries
The consequences of  ended up being less enduring than many observers including me would have assumed
We can only hope that in the end the consequences of  similarly prove to be far less dramatic than we now  intuitively and in our historical reflexes  feel them to be
The End of 
NEW YORK  On May   when World War II in Europe officially ended much of the world lay in ruins
But if the human capacity for destruction knows few limits the ability to start over again is just as remarkable
Perhaps that is why mankind has so far managed to survive
No doubt millions of people at the end of the war were too hungry and exhausted to do anything much beyond staying alive
But at the same time a wave of idealism swept across the wreckage a collective sense of determination to build a more equal peaceful and safer world
That is why the war great hero Winston Churchill was voted out of office in the summer of  even before Japan surrendered
Men and women had not risked their lives simply to return to the old days of class privilege and social deprivation
They wanted better housing education and free health care for all
Similar demands were heard all over Europe where the antiNazi or antifascist resistance was often led by leftists or indeed Communists and prewar conservatives were frequently tainted by collaboration with fascist regimes
There was talk of revolution in countries such as France Italy and Greece
This did not happen because neither the Western Allies nor the Soviet Union supported it
Stalin was content to settle for an empire in Eastern Europe
But even Charles de Gaulle a resistance leader of the right had to accept Communists in his first postwar government and he agreed to nationalize industries and banks
The swing to the left to socialdemocratic welfare states occurred all over Western Europe
It was part of the  consensus
A different kind of revolution was taking place in Europe former colonies in Asia where native peoples had no desire to be ruled once more by Western powers which had been so ignominiously defeated by Japan
Vietnamese Indonesians Filipinos Burmese Indians and Malays wanted their freedom too
These aspirations were often voiced in the United Nations founded in 
The UN like the dream of European unity was also part of the  consensus
For a short while many prominent people  Albert Einstein for one  believed that only a world government would be able to ensure global peace
This dream quickly faded when the Cold War divided the world into two hostile blocs
But in some ways the  consensus in the West was strengthened by Cold War politics
Communism still wrapped in the laurel leaf of antifascism had a wide intellectual and emotional appeal not only in the socalled Third World but also in Western Europe
Social democracy with its promise of greater equality and opportunities for all served as an ideological antidote
Most social democrats were in fact fiercely anticommunist
Today  years later much of the  consensus no longer survives
Few people can muster great enthusiasm for the UN
The European dream is in crisis
And the postwar socialdemocratic welfare state is being eroded more and more every day
The rot began during the s under Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher
Neoliberals attacked the expense of entitlement programs and the vested interests of trade unions
Citizens it was thought had to become more selfreliant government welfare programs were making everyone soft and dependent
In Thatcher famous words there was no such thing as ociety only families and individuals who ought to be taking care of themselves
But the  consensus was dealt a much greater blow precisely when we all rejoiced at the collapse of the Soviet Empire the other great twentiethcentury tyranny
In  it looked as if the dark legacy of World War II the enslavement of Eastern Europe was finally over
And in many ways it was
But much else collapsed with the Soviet model
Social democracy lost its raison dre as an antidote to Communism
All forms of leftist ideology  indeed everything that smacked of collective idealism  came to be viewed as misguided utopianism that could lead only to the Gulag
Neoliberalism filled the vacuum creating vast wealth for some people but at the expense of the ideal of equality that had emerged from World War II
The extraordinary reception of Thomas Piketty Capital in the TwentyFirst Century shows how keenly the consequences of the collapse of the left have been felt
In recent years other ideologies have also emerged to fill the human need for collective ideals
The rise of rightwing populism reflects revived yearnings for pure national communities that keep immigrants and minorities out
And perversely American neoconservatives have transformed the internationalism of the old left by seeking to impose a democratic world order by US military force
The answer to these alarming developments is not nostalgia
We cannot simply return to the past
Too much has changed
But a new aspiration toward social and economic equality and international solidarity is badly needed
It cannot be the same as the  consensus but we would do well on this anniversary to remember why that consensus was forged in the first place
week iPad crisisvsrules comments diary
To my hundredsnbsptitter sicnbspof loyal readers I must apologize for the long gap
It just twomonthstoday since I started this blog and I haven yet learned to combine blogging with absences away from my personal library and mainframe
Nevertheless with trusty iPad in shoulder bag on trip to Spain I maintained internet presence in some discussion forums
Today I cannot settle down to thinking about a new post on Spain capitalism ideology or indeed anything else until Ie first written my comments diary
The trip started well
In the lobby of a hotel somewhere near Heathrow airport I became tremendously excited and spilt my tea as I read a new oped on China by Francis Fukuyama
I had quarreled at length with Fukuyama in my book apitalism Institutions and Economic Development
Despite being a great admirer of his scholarship I argued strongly against his longstanding opinion that culture and informal norms matter more than formal institutions
Gradually he has adjusted his opinion moving closer to mine
No one ever called me modestnbsp
Then on the evening before my flight I read the words Ie been waiting for
he purged Bo Xilai incident has revealed a deep problem in China  the lack of formal institutions and of a real rule of law
The rules the Chinese leadership follows are neither embedded in the constitution clearly articulated nor enforced by a judicial system China needs a genuine rule of law with all of the transparency and formal institutionalisation that entails So in the end informal rules observed by a small clique of insiders cannot really substitute for a formal rule of law China needs formal procedures constraining power through law and elections put big roadblocks in the path of a really bad emperor
Like a dragon I roared my vindication in the comments below that article and on twitter and clapped my hands in delight when Francis himself appeared at Marginal Revolution  within less than an hour  in response to my shouts
This is a delightfully impersonal friendship in the making The internet is a wonderful thing though on looking up from my iPad and spilt greennbsptea I felt embarrassed about my commotion and victory yelps in the posh hotel lobby
Inter alia I said about Fukuyama FT article
This is the most important thing written about China or development in three years The concepts are beautifully handled and the whole thing is interesting and engaging
The message is absolutely fundamental
Readers take note
This article with its simple message is the most important thing you will read on development or China this year
You may not realize that  so Im letting you know
Celebrate by deleting Why Nations Fail from your Kindle
Magnificent
Conceptually this article is superb truly splendid
How long I have waited to read this  years at leastnbspmy book was published  years ago
Once in Spain  it was an eventful week in the world
Words of wisdom from men of wisdom  MR Tyler CowenMichael G Heller May   at  pmThat was a good post from Arnold Kling
I still getting the best news about Spain from external sources but can tell you there was some panic on local radio and Internet newspapers when el eminente Paul Krugman was quoted as saying a orralito was imminent in Spain
The Minister of Interior announced in response to Krugman that no matter how bad the situation they would never contemplate a orralito and begged Krugman to be more rudent in his commentary
The day we arrived in Extremadura the Communist Party was holding a public meeting takeover of the main square that went on all afternoon and evening
Completely peaceful and jolly and humane and apparently not completely unpersuasive or bizarre quite normal
One dreadfully boring and naive speech after another
Time for tapa
On the spot over and out
The background by the way was a panic and reported bank queues last week to withdraw cash after Paul Krugman nsinuated that there could be a corralito in Spain

What Failed in 
BERKELEY  To solve a problem it is not enough to know what to do
You actually have to implement the solution  and be willing to change course if it turns out that you did not know quite as much as you thought
That is the message of two recent books that together tell you everything you need to know about the  financial crisis what caused it what can be done to prevent it from recurring and why those things have yet to be done
The first book is The Shifts and the Shocks by the conservative British journalist Martin Wolf who begins by cataloguing the major shifts that set the stage for the economic disaster that continues to shape the world today
His starting point is the huge rise in wealth among the world richest  and  and the consequent pressure for people governments and companies to take on increasingly unsustainable levels of debt
Meanwhile policymakers were lulled into complacency by the widespread acceptance of economic theories such as the fficientmarket hypothesis which assumes that investors act rationally and use all available information when making their decisions
As a result markets were deregulated making it easier to trade assets that were perceived to be safe but were in fact not
As a result systemic risk proliferated beyond central bankers wildest imagination
Untested  and ultimately incorrect  assumptions created a policymaking environment defined by what can only be called hubris
Officials underestimated tail risks
They set inflation targets at around   leaving little room for maneuver when the water got choppy
And most audaciously of all the European Union introduced the euro as a common currency
Indeed wrongheaded policymaking continued long after the crisis began
Politicians responded to worsening economic conditions by hewing as closely as possible to failed prescriptions making sure to do no more than absolutely necessary to address the biggest economic disaster since the Great Depression
Wolf prescription for countering the crisis is simple smart and unassailable
In the short term he suggests that countries with reserve currencies spend more especially to finance publicsector investments and issue more debt
Their central banks he argues should raise inflation targets to  or even  per year
Over the medium term according to Wolf countries need to put in place regulatory measures that lower debt levels and discourage overleveraging
The eurozone too must resolve its internal contradictions either by disbanding or by introducing  minimum set of institutions and policies that allow the monetary union to function properly
Wolf longterm solutions include tackling inequality ore global regulation a greater degree of reedom for individual countries to craft their own responses and economic analysis that is less in thrall to the freemarket ideologues that led us into the crisis in the first place
And yet as recommendable as Wolf proposals may be little has been done to implement them
The reasons why are found in the second book Hall of Mirrors bynbspmy friend teacher and patron Barry Eichengreen
Eichengreen traces our tepid response to the crisis to the triumph of monetarist economists the disciples of Milton Friedman over their Keynesian and Minskyite peers  at least when it comes to interpretations of the causes and consequences of the Great Depression
When the  financial crisis erupted policymakers tried to apply Friedman proposed solutions to the Great Depression
Unfortunately this turned out to be the wrong thing to do as the monetarist interpretation of the Great Depression was to put it bluntly wrong in significant respects and radically incomplete
The resulting policies were enough to prevent the post recession from developing into a fullblown depression but that partial success turned out to be a Pyrrhic victory for it allowed politicians to declare that the crisis had been overcome and that it was time to embrace austerity and focus on structural reform
The result is today stagnant economy marked by anemic growth that threatens to become the new normal
The United States and Europe are on track to have thrown away  of their potential wealth while the failure to strengthen financialsector regulation has left the world economy exposed to the risk of another major crisis
Wolf and Eichengreen would agree that the main shortcomings that led to the  financial crisis  and that continue to underpin our inadequate response to it  are intellectual
Indeed the only true lesson of the crisis so far seems to be that its lessons will never truly be learned
 My Space Odyssey
MOSCOW  Most people who know of me think of me as an informationtechnology expert someone who probably lives in California and invests in edgy Internet startups
In fact my formal residence is in New York City but I am about to spend most of the next five months in Russia training to be a cosmonaut in Star City just outside Moscow
It all came about in a number of ways
First of all as a kid I just assumed that I would go to the moon without having to do much in particular to make it happen
I just took it for granted that by the time I was say  space travel would be a common thing
My father was involved with the United States space program and we had some moon rocks at home so I thought it was no big deal
Then I got distracted for about  years
A few years ago however I started paying attention to space again
A lot of people I knew in the IT industry were doing the same Elon Musk a cofounder of PayPal founded SpaceX Jeff Bezos of Amazon started a spacecraft company called Blue Origin Jeff Greason a senior manager at Intel started XCOR Aerospace in which I an investor
In  the last year I held my PC Forum conference for IT entrepreneurs I started a conference called Flight School for entrepreneurs in space and private aviation
Meanwhile in about  I was in South Africa with a small group advising former President Thabo Mbeki and his government about its IT policy
One of the group was Mark Shuttleworth founder of Thawte sold to VeriSign who had recently come back from a trip to the space station as the second pace tourist
One evening the group sat around a campfire as the sun set andaround  African schoolchildren were bussed in
Altogether there were about  of us President Mbeki included around a roaring fire
Once it was dark a screen was set up and Mark showed home videos from space
He gave a fascinating talk about his adventures complete with clips of him floating around catching bubbles in his mouth and so on
The kids loved it and Im sure some of them decided then and there to study math and science
Eventually I invested in Space Adventures the company that organized Shuttleworth trip into space
Later I went on a tour that they organized to watch the launch of Charles Simonyi the fifth and soon seventh space tourist from Baikonur in Kazakhstan
Simonyi wrote the Microsoft Word program and now has another startup Intentional Software and a foundation as well as a Web site CharlesinSpaceorg
Soon after I started casually discussing the notion of becoming a backup cosmonaut with the Space Adventures team
Yes I would love to actually go but the trip to space costs  to  million whereas backup training costs nly  million
So I had vague thoughts that I might go into space sometime in   the year that Google cofounder Sergey Brin is very tentatively slated to go
Space Adventures was pushing for  but I was pretty busy
Then something happened last spring my sister Emily discovered that she had cancer and had a double mastectomy
She is doing well now and in fact just won a minimarathon
A couple of weeks later I was faced with one of those conflicts a board meeting here a conference there another opportunity at the same time somewhere else
aagh I thought f only I had a double mastectomy I could cancel all these things and no one would complain
Good grief I realized my priorities were all out of whack So in some odd way this sabbatical in Russia is my alternative to a double mastectomy  a positive one to be sure but the same kind of resetbutton experience
It is also the answer to another question I hear a lot because of my work on human genetics through andMe wwwandmecom and the Personal Genome Project wwwpersonalgenomeorgIf you learned you had a high chance of developing Alzheimer in a few years what would you do
Why I go train to be a cosmonaut of courseAnd why wait to find out I may get Alzheimer Next month I will write about what training to go into space actually involves
A Comeback Strategy for Europe
STOCKHOLMMADRID  When Pope Francis addressed the European Parliament last November he compared the European Union to a grandmother  pleasant and rich with experience but lacking the vitality and energy of the past
It is high time Francis argued that EU leaders shed their dozy image recognize the strategic challenges that Europe faces and forge a clear policy for tackling them
Admittedly the pope characterization was alarmingly accurate in some respects
But despite its seeming lassitude Europe retains significant strengths
It is a hub of highlevel thought and innovation it is home to some of the world most competitive regions and industries and perhaps most impressive it has built a community and market encompassing a halfbillion people
But the world is changing the AsiaPacific region is increasingly influencing global developments economic and otherwise
The TransPacific Partnership  by which the United States and  other countries would create a megaregional freetrade zone  would most likely accelerate this shift all the more so if China eventually joins
Though the TPP faces no shortage of hurdles to clear before an agreement is finalized its potential to augment Asia economic power cannot be underestimated
Europe must work to secure its position in the new world order  beginning by enhancing its own trade and investment ties with the US
The problem is that as the TPP negotiations progress talks on the EUUS Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership TTIP have become so deeply mired in domestic controversies that the entire project may well be scuttled
Business leaders on both sides of the Atlantic are convinced that a successful TTIP agreement would bring substantial economic benefits  a perception that many studies reinforce
Yet trivial issues  for example the use of chlorinated chicken and settlements of investor disputes  continue to dominate the debate
The TTIP goal is to unleash the power of the transatlantic economy which remains by far the world largest and wealthiest market accounting for threequarters of global financial activity and more than half of world trade
If the TTIP was opened to other economies  such as Turkey Mexico and Canada  the benefits would be even greater
Even more compelling than the benefits of achieving an agreement though are the potentially catastrophic consequences of failure
For starters a breakdown of TTIP talks would give considerable ammunition to those in the United Kingdom who advocate withdrawal from the EU conversely if the TTIP were implemented the UK would be unwise  and thus unlikely  to leave
Moreover the perception that the EU internal squabbles had led it to squander a strategic opportunity would probably drive the US to accelerate its disengagement from the continent
And Russian President Vladimir Putin would invariably regard the EU failure as a major opportunity to exert more influence over parts of Europe
All of this contributes to a starkly fundamental strategic risk If the TTIP stalls or collapses while the TPP moves forward and succeeds the global balance will tip strongly in Asia favor  and Europe will have few options if any for regaining its economic and geopolitical influence
When the TTIP was first proposed Europe seemed to recognize its value
Indeed it was the EU that pushed the US which initially doubted Europe commitment to launch the negotiation process in June 
The ambition was to complete the negotiations on ne tank of gas
No one wanted to endure protracted talks  or the associated political pain
But EU leaders essentially abandoned the project seemingly confirming American fears
Trade negotiators struggled to make headway while antiglobalization groups seized control of the public discourse presenting the TTIP as a threat to everything from Europe democracy to its health
This is dangerously inaccurate talk and EU leaders must prevent it from gaining any more traction by making the strategic case for the agreement
And they must revive their commitment to conclude the talks successfully in 
This is not to say that resolving the remaining issues in the TTIP negotiations will be simple
But establishing a trade agreement especially one that entails so many regulatory issues is always difficult as it must account for the complexity and changeability of modern economies
The fact is that the challenges inherent in completing the TTIP are no more intractable than those that EU leaders have faced in the last few years of crisis
When the TTIP negotiations resume next month EU leaders must push for genuine progress with the goal of completing a deal by the end of the year
The good news is that the recent midterm elections in the US might have improved their chances
President Barack Obama now might get socalled fasttrack negotiating authority from Congress
If he does Congress would simply approve or reject any negotiated agreement rather than picking it apart
The US presidential election season is starting and other issues in the new year could easily take over the EU agenda
That is why Europe leaders have no time to waste
They must seize economic opportunity  and avert strategic disaster
 and the New Authoritarianism
Five years after the attacks on the Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon in Washington  is no longer a mere date
It has entered the history books as the beginning of something new a new era perhaps but in any case a time of change
The terrorist bombings in Madrid and London and elsewhere will also be remembered but it is  that has become the catchphrase almost like ugust 
But was it really a war that started on September  
Not all are happy about this American notion
During the heyday of Irish terrorism in the UK successive British governments went out of their way not to concede to the IRA the notion that a war was being waged
ar would have meant acceptance of the terrorists as legitimate enemies in a sense as equals in a bloody contest for which there are accepted rules of engagement
This is neither a correct description nor a useful terminology for terrorist acts which are more correctly described as criminal
By calling them war  and naming an opponent usually alQaeda and its leader Osama bin Laden  the United States government has justified domestic changes that before the  attacks would have been unacceptable in any free country
Most of these changes were embodied in the socalled SA Patriot Act
Though some of the changes simply involved administrative regulations the Patriot Act overall effect was to erode the great pillars of liberty such as habeas corpus  the right to recourse to an independent court whenever the state deprives an individual of his freedom
From an early date the prison camp at Guantnamo Bay in Cuba became the symbol of something unheard of the arrest without trial of llegal combatants who are deprived of all human rights
The world now wonders how many more of these nonhuman humans are there in how many places
For everyone else a kind of state of emergency was proclaimed that has allowed state interference in essential civil rights
Controls at borders have become an ordeal for many and police persecution now burdens quite a few
A climate of fear has made life hard for anyone who looks suspicious or acts suspiciously notably for Muslims
Such restrictions on freedom did not meet with much public opposition when they were adopted
On the contrary by and large it was the critics not the supporters of these measures who found themselves in trouble
In Britain where Prime Minister Tony Blair supported the US attitude entirely the government introduced similar measures and even offered a new theory
Blair was the first to argue that security is the first freedom
In other words liberty is not the right of individuals to define their own lives but the right of the state to restrict individual freedom in the name of a security that only the state can define
This is the beginning of a new authoritarianism
The problem exists in all countries affected by the threat of terrorism though in many it has not become quite as specific
In most countries of continental Europe  has remained an American date
There is even a debate  and indeed some evidence  concerning the question of whether involvement in the ar against terrorism has actually increased the threat of terrorist acts
Germans certainly use this argument to stay out of the action wherever possible
This stance however has not prevented the spread of something for which a German word is used in other languages too Angst 
A diffuse anxiety is gaining ground
People feel uneasy and worried especially when traveling
Any train accident or airplane crash is now at first suspected of being an act of terrorism
Thus  has meant directly or indirectly a great shock both psychologically and to our political systems
While terrorism is fought in the name of democracy the fight has in fact led to a distinct weakening of democracy owing to official legislation and popular angst
One of the worrying features of the  attacks is that it is hard to see their purpose beyond the perpetrators resentment of the West and its ways
But the West key features democracy and the rule of law have taken a far more severe battering at the hands of their defenders than by their attackers
Two steps above all are needed to restore confidence in liberty within the democracies affected by the legacy of 
First we must make certain that the relevant legislation to meet the challenge of terrorism is strictly temporary
Some of today restrictions on habeas corpus and civil liberties have sunset clauses restricting their validity all such rules should be reexamined by parliaments regularly
Second and more importantly our leaders must seek to calm rather than exploit public anxiety
The terrorists with whom we are currently at ar cannot win because their dark vision will never gain broad popular legitimacy
That is all the more reason for democrats to stand tall in defending our values  first and foremost by acting in accordance with them
 in Perspective
NEW YORK  It was a decade ago that  terrorists took control of four planes flew two into the twin towers of the World Trade Center hit the Pentagon with a third and crashed the fourth in a field in Pennsylvania after passengers resisted and made it impossible for the terrorists to complete their malevolent mission
In a matter of hours more than  innocent people mostly Americans but also people from  other countries had their lives suddenly and violently taken from them
September   was a terrible tragedy by any measure but it was not a historical turning point
It did not herald a new era of international relations in which terrorists with a global agenda prevailed or in which such spectacular terrorist attacks became commonplace
On the contrary  has not been replicated
Despite the attention devoted to the lobal War on Terrorism the most important developments of the last ten years have been the introduction and spread of innovative information technologies globalization the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the political upheavals in the Middle East
As for the future it is much more likely to be defined by the United States need to put its economic house in order China trajectory within and beyond its borders and the ability of the world governments to cooperate on restoring economic growth stemming the spread of nuclear weapons and meeting energy and environmental challenges
It is and would be wrong to make opposition to terrorism the centerpiece of what responsible governments do in the world
Terrorists continue to be outliers with limited appeal at best
They can destroy but not create
It is worth noting that the people who went into the streets of Cairo and Damascus calling for change were not shouting the slogans of Al Qaeda or supporting its agenda
Moreover measures have been implemented to push back successfully against terrorists
Intelligence assets have been redirected
Borders have been made more secure and societies more resilient
International cooperation has increased markedly in part because governments that cannot agree on many things can agree on the need to cooperate in this area
Military force has played a role as well
Al Qaeda lost its base in Afghanistan when the Taliban government that had provided it sanctuary was ousted from power
Osama binLaden was finally found and killed by US Special Forces in the suburbs of Islamabad
Drones  unmanned aircraft that are remotely steered  have proven to be effective in killing a significant number of terrorists including many of the most important leaders
Weak governments can be made stronger governments that tolerate or support terrorism must be held accountable
But progress is not to be confused with victory
Terrorists and terrorism cannot be eliminated any more than we can rid the world of disease
There will always be those who will resort to force against innocent men women and children in pursuit of political goals
Indeed terrorists are advancing in some areas
Pakistan remains a sanctuary for Al Qaeda and some of the world other most dangerous terrorists
A mixture of instability government weakness and ideology in countries such as Yemen Libya Somalia and Nigeria are providing fertile territory for terrorists to organize train and mount operations  much as they did in Afghanistan did a decade ago
New groups constantly emerge from the ruins of old ones
There is also a growing danger of homegrown terrorism
We have seen it in Great Britain and the US
The Internet one of the great inventions of the modern Western world has shown itself to be a weapon that can be used to incite and train those who wish to cause harm to that world
The question raised in October  by then US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is no less relevant today re we capturing killing or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting training and deploying against us
All things being equal we probably are
But even small terrorist successes are costly in terms of lives money and making open societies less so
What is to be done
Alas there is no single or silver bullet
The establishment of a Palestinian state will not be enough for those terrorists who want to see the elimination of the Jewish state any more than reaching a compromise over Kashmir will satisfy those Pakistanbased terrorists with bigger agendas visvis India
Reducing unemployment is desirable of course but many terrorists do not come from poverty
Helping to make societies in the Middle East and elsewhere more democratic might reduce the alienation that can lead to radicalism and worse but this is easier said than done
Of course we want to continue to find ways to make ourselves less vulnerable and terrorists more so
But what may be most important particularly in the Arab and Islamic communities is to end any acceptance of terrorism
The Nigerian father who warned the US embassy in Lagos that he feared what his own son might do  before that same young man attempted to detonate a bomb aboard a flight to Detroit on Christmas Day   is an example of just this
Only when more parents teachers and community leaders behave likewise will recruitment of terrorists dry up and lawenforcement authorities receive full cooperation from the populations they police
Terrorism must lose its legitimacy among those who have historically supported or tolerated it before it will lose its potency
A ortfolio Approach to Climate Change
The world has tried with little success to cut carbon emissions under the Kyoto Protocol
The enormous effort expended to bring the Protocol into force nonetheless indicates how much work will be required to produce the next treaty due to be agreed in Copenhagen in December 
Campaigners will push for tough and farreaching policies but strong resistance will continue from countries concerned about their economic vitality
The new negotiations will have one advantage over the earlier efforts because governments now understand the need for a portfolio of adaptation mitigation and research efforts
New research that my colleagues and I undertook for the Copenhagen Consensus Center in Denmark explores the effectiveness of different responses to this global challenge but it strongly supports the portfolio approach for several reasons
First we now know that adaptation will be essential because temperatures will rise by another C by  even if greenhouse gas emissions are eliminated tomorrow
We also know that the impact of climate change will not be evenly distributed across the globe
In some areas modestly warmer temperatures could produce higher crop yields if associated changes in precipitation patterns are not adverse andor irrigation remains viable
Even with C warming however Africa and South Asia will experience almost immediate reductions in the viability of many crops and eventually increased vulnerability to infectious disease
These impacts will clearly hit the planet worstoff inhabitants hardest the ottom billion who already bear the heaviest burden of disease poverty conflict and malnutrition
Ensuring that adaptive capacity is expanded and exploited where it is most needed is thus a key challenge
Longterm development may give countries more capacity to soften the impact of climate change on the environment and citizens health but in the meantime the planet poorest people will need help from the rich
Our analysis investigated for example the merits of more targeted policies for the near term purchasing mosquitoresistant bed nets and oral rehydration malaria therapy for children in the poorest nations affected by climate change
The goal was to deal aggressively and proactively with some of the marginal health impacts of global warming
Benefits would appear almost immediately but would dissipate over time as economies developed
Even as development improves conditions however reducing carbon emissions would become increasingly important over the longer term as the impact of climate change become more severe
Since the effects of climate change have been observed in many areas around the world thinking about mitigation makes sense everywhere
But we found that mitigation
The Copenhagen Consensus study also examined a portfolio option of the sort heralded by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
We allocated  billion to research into greener technology so that only  billion could be absorbed by the economic cost of adaptation and mitigation
The gap between the cost of carbonfree and carbonemitting technology fell and the taxes designed to mitigate emissions became more effective
As a result the research and development program essentially paid for itself and total discounted benefits for the  billion investment climbed to more than  trillion
Ensuring that research and development is part of the world climate change response portfolio would make mitigation efforts more efficient and significantly enhance their ability to reduce carbon emissions over the next century
But these favorable net benefits reflect very conservative assumptions regarding the timing of emissions reductions and when the developing world would ome onboard
Optimizing investment in the portfolio over time would for example increase the discounted benefits by more than a factor of three
Expected benefits would increase further if we included the chance that potentially higher climate sensitivities would exacerbate damages even though doing so would require including similarly plausible lower climate sensitivities which would push in the opposite direction
Fighting climate change can be a sound investment even though neither mitigation nor adaptation alone will be enough to olve the problem
To make a real difference especially in the near term the world must combine mitigation and adaptation with increased research and development into carbonsaving and sequestering technology which in turn requires designing and exploiting marketbased incentives
A eset Button for Europe Backyard
STOCKHOLM  One year after the war in Georgia of last August pushing the eset button on diplomatic relations is a popular endeavor nowadays
President Barack Obama recently journeyed to Moscow in order to eset strained United StatesRussian ties
The European Union though not in need of a eset because of strained ties with its eastern neighbors is involved in a deep strategic reconstruction of those relations
When the EU launched its new astern Partnership in May the purpose was to promote further integration with the Union six immediate eastern neighbors  Armenia Azerbaijan Belarus Georgia Moldova and Ukraine
The global financial crisis had made an updated and strengthened policy for the EU eastern neighborhood an urgent need
Equally important was the fact that all the countries concerned expressed an ambition to move closer to the EU
The Eastern Partnership  originating from a PolishSwedish initiative  offers to the six countries a substantial upgrading and deepening of relations with the EU in key areas
In trade and economic relations it clearly sets out the objective of establishing deep and comprehensive freetrade areas between the EU and the partner countries
It confirms full visa liberalization as a longterm goal with visa facilitation agreements in the meantime promises enhanced cooperation on energy security diversification and efficiency and comes with dedicated programs and projects to help the neighbors in their integration and reform efforts in all these areas
Sweden assumption of the EU Presidency this month should help these efforts
However it comes at a time when the Union eastern neighborhood faces severe challenges with the financial and economic crisis hitting many of the partner countries hard
Ukraine suffers from the sharp drop in global demand and trade severely undermining its steel industry
Georgia economic success has been largely dependent on direct foreign investment for which there is hardly any appetite today
Partner countries that are less integrated into the global market such as Moldova have seen the crisis arrive more slowly but the real effect might be equally as bad and they are likely to recover more slowly
The Eastern Partnership does not offer any quick remedies to the crisis
But it can provide a political framework and institutionbuilding support to improve the deficiencies that made these countries so vulnerable to the crisis imperfect market economies weak state institutions and continued corruption
The Eastern Partnership offer of deep integration with the EU in the areas such as trade and energy carries with it considerable transformational power
The other type of crisis that most of the partner countries are enduring is political
In most of these countries democratic development has not yet reached a point where a change in government is a routine part of political life and can take place without risking the country stability
The Eastern Partnership is based on the profound values of democracy human rights and the rule of law
Political association with the EU and the process of integration under this Partnership will promote reforms in these key areas
The Swedish EU Presidency will concentrate on starting up the concrete work  the nuts and bolts  of the Partnership
The establishment of omprehensive InstitutionBuilding Programs designed to support reform of key institutions in each partner country should take place before the year end
Some flagship initiatives proposed by the European Commission will finally see the light of day as well and new projects and initiatives are likely to be developed
Here Sweden will attach particular importance to energy efficiency programs which will serve not only the purposes of enhancing energy security and reducing costs but will also be an important contribution to the fight against climate change
The Swedish Presidency together with the European Commission intends to organize the first meeting of the Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum this autumn
We hope to see the start of parliamentary cooperation as well as exchanges between local and regional authorities of the thirtythree EU and partner countries
At the end of the year a meeting of EU foreign ministers and their colleagues from the six partners will assess the progress made so far and give guidance on the way ahead
The Eastern Partnership is about EU integration about the six countries moving closer to the EU values legislation and ways of working and about the EU being there to support and help this convergence
In Russia there is a perception that is sometimes fostered which suggests that the Partnership is directed against it
But this of course is untrue
On the contrary Russia like Turkey will be welcome to take part in relevant activities within the Partnership multilateral dimensions
The Eastern Partnership is not an answer to all the problems and difficulties that the six partners are facing
Nevertheless it does represent a clear commitment by the EU to lend its political and economic support to their transition and reform  a process that should bring prosperity and stability to the whole region
A hird Way for Confronting Russia
PARIS  et engage Russia if we can but contain it if we must
These two alternatives already defined Western strategy toward Russia in the mid
Since then Russia may have changed dramatically but not our questions about it
What do you do when your big neighbor widens the gap that exists between its culture which is European and its political system which is becoming increasingly sian at least in the bad old sense of riental despotism
Should the best answer to the return of Russia imperial ambitions be a modern version of a Holy Alliance of stability designed to contain the world new maverick
Or is a latterday Yalta Conference aimed at redrawing the political boundaries of Europe necessary
Could the answer be a bit of both
If Russia is becoming what revolutionary France was under Napoleon or reverting to Soviet form  shorn of a totalitarian ideology but with an appetite for conquest and reconquest  what is needed is not the eague of democracies advocated by some conservatives in America
What is needed instead is a tability league that includes prominent actors like China India and other countries that are more interested in economic growth than in ocking the boat of the international system
Such a strategy implies first of all a solid partnership with China not because it is evolving in the direction of democracy but because it is a statusquo power
Such a strategy could lead to the opening of negotiations with Iran and of course to a further closing of ranks within NATO
The message to the Kremlin here would be crystal clear
o not fool yourself
Nationalism and imperialism will lead you nowhere you cannot expand geographically without serious costs to your economic growth and your personal enrichment
Europe may be weak and divided America may no longer be what it was but with your falling population and the sad state of your economy beyond oil and gas you simply are not equipped to be in the league of great global powers
China is you are not
But the containment argument fails because the Kremlin can still make mischief around the world by acting with Syria or Venezuela in an irresponsible manner
More importantly rallying the world solely against Russia would mean taking Russia great power pretensions too seriously
For example many Asians believe that Russia is a problem for Europe but no longer for the world
At the Cold War end Japan remained obsessed with Russia as the heir to the Soviet Union
Today the Japanese are so concerned with China that they have little time for fears about Russia
The other alternative to a rebirth of ontainment would consist in accepting the Russian argument or more precisely Russian motions
It would mean saying in effect e have unnecessarily humiliated you over the last ten years
From NATO enlargement to the grant of independence to Kosovo we have deliberately ignored your sensitivities and your interests
Let sit down together like Churchill Roosevelt and Stalin at Yalta and redesign a twentyfirstcentury map of Europe
What do you want back
What do we keep
This approach might recognize Russia droit de regard on the future evolution of the Caucasus
Indeed while talking tough under the guidance of Nicolas Sarkozy France which currently holds the EU presidency Europe has de facto resigned itself to Georgia dismemberment
Russian troops are to remain in South Ossetia and Abkhazia
The West is not about to declare war on Russia for the sake of a Georgia whose credibility has been greatly eroded by its president irresponsible behavior
As for Ukraine it may one day become part of the European Union but its future is not in NATO
Yet between allout containment which is very unlikely and not necessarily desirable or realistic and accommodation which borders on appeasement which would be dangerous for Europe future a third way based on a few firm principles must be found
These principles are clear
First Ukraine territorial integrity is not negotiable
This has been said many times but repetition does not diminish its importance
Russia without Ukraine is a manageable nationstate Russia with Ukraine is an unmanageable empire
Second even if the West condemns Georgia irresponsibility and incorporates into its policy Russia sensitivities on the complex historical feelings related to its eximperial territories the Kremlin shameless brutality is unacceptable
After all this is Europe more than six decades after World War II and nearly  years after the collapse of the Soviet Union
The use of force to settle scores and impose one nation will upon another cannot be accepted passively
In the short term time may be on Russia side
In the long run  economically demographically politically strategically  time is on ur side if we stick to our values and our principles
A 
The drubbing that many governments suffered in the recent elections to the European Union Parliament places them in a difficult position as they maneuver ahead of this weeks EU Summit
Only an incurable optimist can hope that the summit will bring glory to any of them
The summit has two purposes to finalize the text of a new EU Constitution and to appoint the next President of the Commission
These negotiations will be much harder in view of the spectacular repudiation of a number of key governments at the ballot box together with the potent rise of protest and Euroskeptic parties in several member states
The problem for Europes leaders is that their own repudiation by voters does not necessarily carry the same message as the rise of the Euroskeptic parties
The record slump in the vote for Gerhard Schrders governing Social Democrats in Germany has little to do with his policy towards Europe but a great deal to do with the perceived failure of his economic policies  and the persistence of low growth and high unemployment  at home
Despite nationalist parties success in France the same is true of the setback for President Jacques Chiracs centreright party
In Britain by contrast where the economy is strong and unemployment low the main factor behind the collapse in the vote for the governing Labor Party has been anger with Tony Blairs determination to go to war in Iraq beside George Bush
Nevertheless the rise of Euroskeptic parties in a number of countries including Britain France Belgium Poland and the Czech Republic has worrying implications for a summit meeting whose purpose is to take European integration a small but unmistakable step forward
In Britain in particular the spectacular surge of the UK Independence Party UKIP can only strengthen the governments longstanding latent Euroskepticism
The proposed constitution will contain a Charter of Fundamental Rights which is intended to enhance the political and moral legitimacy of the EU
But will it really enhance the rights of EU citizens
Or as the British government insists will it merely be a declaratory document that only describes rights already existing under national legislation in the member states
The draft constitution would enhance the policymaking powers of the Union with a bit more majority voting in the Council of Ministers and a stronger role for the European Parliament
But despite Tony Blairs onetime declaration that he would take Britain into the heart of Europe he remains viscerally opposed to the prospect of further integration and he will resist any new encroachment on British sovereignty in his red line areas of tax foreign policy and EU budget finance
Blairs Euroskepticism is understandable insofar as it chimes with the British mood
Opinion polls consistently show that British voters are unenthusiastic about the EU and the picture is confirmed by the latest Eurobarometer poll conducted throughout the Union for the Commission  but before the recent enlargement from  to  member states
One question always asked in this poll is whether voters tend to trust or mistrust different institutions such as national parliaments national governments and the European Union
Overall the general level of trust in the European Union is not high only  of voters tend to trust the EU whereas  tend not to trust it
But in Britain the figures are dramatically different only  trust the EU while  distrust it
By contrast the European Parliament has a better reputation than the EU as a whole the average EUwide level of trust in the European Parliament is  whereas in Britain it is 
Across the EU  think EU membership is a good thing in Britain this figure falls to 
On virtually every question British voters are less enthusiastic about the EU than voters in any other country 
One might think that Britons aversion to the EU would be reflected in support for and pride in their national institutions
Not so
British trust in the European Parliament may stand at only  but trust in the Westminster Parliament is much lower at only   the lowest figure in the EU
Trust in the national government is a bit higher but still only  while trust in national political parties is only 
Both figures are again the lowest in the EU
Voters in other states have more confidence in EU institutions but their opinion of their own institutions is also low
In France  trust the European Parliament but only  trust the French parliament while the corresponding figures for Germany are  and  
But the puzzle in the poll is that even if Europes voters are unenthusiastic about the EU and its existing institutions as they stand now  of them would support a common foreign policy for Europe and  would support a common defense and security policy even in Britain there is  support for the idea of a common defense policy
This may be a reaction to the Americanled war in Iraq but Tony Blair will exclude it precisely for that reason and a common European defense policy without Britain makes little sense
The predicament for Europes leaders at this weeks summit is that they stand at the cusp of an unstable process of European integration
With the accession of  new members the EU must become more integrated if it is to function
But it is not at all clear that those governments that would normally support more integration can sell it to their disillusioned electorates
Tony Blair has promised a referendum on the new EU constitution which he cannot possibly win
The central question will be whether Europes leaders deliberately play for failure in the hope that the problem will go away
A Bad Deal for America Future
WASHINGTON DC  The painfully negotiated US budget legislation that President Barack Obama signed on August  combines an increase in America government debt ceiling with reductions in federal spending thus averting the prospect of the first default in the year history of the United States
But the agreement has three major flaws
Two of them offset each other but the third threatens what America needs most in the coming years economic growth
The first flaw is that the spending reductions are badly timed coming as they do when the US economy is weak they risk triggering another recession
The measure second shortcoming however is that the spending reductions that it mandates are modest
While the legislation does too little to address America problem of chronic and rising budget deficits the damage that it inflicts on the economy in the short term is likely to be limited
The third and most damaging flaw however is that the spending cuts come in the wrong places
Because the Democrats in Congress have an almost religious commitment to preserving intact America principal welfare programs for senior citizens Social Security and Medicare the legislation does not touch either of them
These programs costs will rise sharply as the millionstrong babyboom generation  those born between  and   retires and collects benefits accounting for the largest increase in government spending and prospective deficits in the years ahead
And because the Republicans in Congress have an equally strong allergy to raising any taxes any time under any circumstances the bill does not rely at all on tax increases  not even for the wealthiest Americans  for the deficit reduction that it provides
All of the spending cuts come from the iscretionary part of the federal budget which excludes Social Security Medicare the Medicaid program for the poor and interest on the national debt
That leaves only about onethird of total federal spending from which to cut and much of that goes to the defense budget which Republicans will attempt to protect in the future
So the structure established by the August  law concentrates deficit reduction on the iscretionary nondefense part of the federal budget which is only about  of it
This is too small a pool of money from which to achieve deficit reduction on the scale that the US will need in the years ahead
Worse yet discretionary nondefense spending includes programs that are indispensable for economic growth  and economic growth is indispensable for America future prosperity and global standing
Growth is in the first place the best way to reduce the country budget deficits
The higher the growth rate the more revenues the government will collect without raising tax rates and higher revenues enable smaller deficits
Moreover economic growth is necessary to keep the promise  enormously important to individual Americans  that each generation will have the opportunity to become more prosperous than the preceding one the popular term for which is he American dream
Just as important for nonAmericans only robust economic growth can ensure that the US sustains its expansive role in the world which supports the global economy and contributes to stability in Europe East Asia and the Middle East
As Thomas L Friedman and I explain in our forthcoming book That Used To Be Us How America Fell Behind in the World It Invented and How We Can Come Back a crucial factor in Americas economic success has been an ongoing publicprivate partnership which dates back to the founding of the country that is imperiled by the pattern of budget cuts established by the August  legislation
That partnership has five components wider opportunities for education in order to produce a workforce with cuttingedge skills investment in infrastructure  roads power plants and ports  that supports commerce funds for research and development to expand the frontiers of knowledge in ways that generate new products an immigration policy that attracts and retains talented people from beyond America borders and business regulations strong enough to prevent disasters such as the nearmeltdown of the financial system in  but not so stringent as to stifle the risktaking and innovation that produce growth
The first three elements of the American formula for growth cost money and that money is included in the iscretionary nondefense part of the federal budget now targeted by the debtceiling legislation
Cutting these programs will lower American economic growth in the long term with negative consequences both at home and abroad
Reducing the deficit by cutting funds for education infrastructure and research and development is akin to trying to lose weight by cutting off three fingers
Most of the weight will remain and one life prospects will have worsened significantly
Reducing deficits in order to raise the debt ceiling was the right thing to do but the August  law does it in the wrong way
Unless more deficit reduction which is inevitable comes from curbing entitlement benefits and increasing revenues and less from programs vital for economic growth the result will be a poorer weaker US  and a more uncertain if not unstable world
A Balanced EU Constitution
EU Commission President Romano Prodi has proposed a scheme to strengthen the Unions executive
Britain France and Spain are working on an opposing plan that will consolidate EU executive powers among the biggest EU states
Whats the ordinary European to think
Europes citizens scarcely grasp the issues at the heart of the European Constitutional Convention in Brussels
Mountains of detail obscure problems sterile misleading national discussions that pit Euroskeptics against Europhiles muster sound and fury but clarify nothing
So complicated do many issues seem that some newspapers and broadcasters have abandoned reporting about the Convention
EU citizens can secure a clearer understanding of what the Convention should achieve by asking this question how should governmental functions be divided between the EU and its member nations
To answer this we need to grasp governments true purpose
Government should provide citizens with public goods collective defense legislation and regulation enforcement of the rule of law
These can be provided at different levels local regional national or supranational government ie the EU
But what is the right level
In some areas decentralization works because it recognizes diverse local or national communities
However local decisions often have repercussions on citizens in other communities
So certain services should be allocated to a broader geographic unit because they have externalities that is interdependence of effects
Europes allocation of governmental powers should be based on the principle that institutions carry out only those activities with clear economies of scale and where differences of opinion are modest
The lower a government activitys externalities the more it should be localized
Low externalities imply limited benefits to be gained from centralization deep differences among citizens imply that the costs of harmonization would be too high
The euro for example delivers clear advantages of scale by favoring international commerce and avoiding negative externalities
No longer can the lira be devalued to favor Italian exports to the detriment of the French followed by a French reaction etc
Although the imperfectly synchronized economic cycles of EU members causes friction over monetary and exchange rate policy the euros benefits outweigh the costs of diversity
In educational policy however to impose the same system on all members would not create economies of scale
Cultural differences are too strong to win voluntary compliance
It would be absurd to delegate education and culture to a supranational level
Of the areas of public policy with high economies of scale or externalities two stand out the common market and competition and foreign policy and defense
The former covers antitrust trade and the common currency
Some think that fiscal policies  from the structure of taxation to welfare to budget balances  should also be harmonized
But national preferences are diverse and if mechanically imposed fiscal centralization might incite resistance
Nor do centralized fiscal policies have any real raison dtre from a constitutional point of view
The US Constitution for example does not prescribe balanced budgets for the states
Only in exceptional circumstances is fiscal harmonization justified prohibitions say on fiscal incentives aimed at limiting competition impeding commerce or restricting the movement of capital
Foreign policy and defense belong par excellence at governments apex
There are clear externalities and economies of scale
It would be absurd if New York pursued a different foreign policy than Texas
Much the same is true in Europe
The addition of new EU members implies that more internal differences will occur which means that fewer centralized policies are justified
These considerations suggest a series of principles for the Convention to consider

The EU Constitution should establish unequivocally which prerogatives belong to Europe and which to member countries
When in doubt the principle of subsidiarity suggests that national states remain supreme

Europeanlevel institutions should guarantee the functioning of markets including competition commercial and monetary policies

Fiscal policy should remain largely decentralized save for a few exceptions

Foreign policy and defense are areas of federal competence to be delegated to Europe at a proper time

The creation of new areas of federal competence should be accompanied by decisionmaking mechanisms found in genuinely representative democracies
So No centralization without representation
Todays EU diverges enormously from these principles see table as is demonstrated by the fact that agriculture which represents  of European GDP accounts for  of EU expenditures
Activities of EU Institutions percent of total

Europe faces an historic opportunity
Americas founding fathers wrote a Constitution that has lasted over  years
Members of the European Convention obviously face a far more complex and diverse societyand thus a more daunting constitutional challenge
But they can succeed by displaying comparable wisdom and foresight
A Balanced Look at SinoAmerican Imbalances
BEIJING  Before July  most economists agreed that global imbalances were the most important threat to global growth
It was argued that the United States rising net foreign debttoGDP ratio  the result of chronic currentaccount deficits  would put a sharp brake on capital inflows in turn weakening the dollar driving up interest rates and plunging the US economy into crisis
But this scenario failed to materialize
Instead the crisis stemmed from the US subprime debacle which quickly dragged the global economy into its deepest recession since the 
Most economists failed to foresee the economic dynamics that actually led to the crisis because they failed to pay enough attention to the rapid increase in US total debt
Instead they focused exclusively on US foreign debt ignoring household debt mortgage and consumer debt public debt business debt and financial debt
In particular they should have paid greater attention to the sustainability of US mortgage and consumer debt
In  the mortgage and consumer debttoGDP ratio was more than  compared to  for net foreign debt
Of course the various components of debt differ considerably in their character and sources of financing  and thus in their sustainability
But all parts of a country total debt and how it is financed are interconnected
This means two things
First funds from different sources of finance are interchangeable to a certain degree deficiency of funds for one component of total debt can be supplemented by surplus funds originally aimed at financing other components
Second troubles in any single component of total debt will have an impact on all the other components
After the subprime crisis erupted mortgage and consumer debt was paid down by households either with their savings or by default
The fall in US total debt and the narrowing of the financing gap between total debt and domestic funds led to a significant improvement in the US currentaccount deficit in  disproving US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke claim that the deficit was caused by a global aving glut
Indeed America currentaccount position strengthened despite the dollar appreciation in the face of safehaven demand
Unfortunately as a result of the privatesector deleveraging and an increase in household savings the US economy driven by debt and consumption slid into recession
To offset the negative impact of privatesector deleveraging on growth the US government has maintained expansionary fiscal and monetary policies
Now with household debt sustained on a knifeedge after feverish government intervention the fiscal position has deteriorated dramatically and the currentaccount balance has worsened again
Sustainability of public debt has replaced sustainability of private debt as the biggest threat to financial stability and the focus of debate about the US current account has shifted from the sustainability of foreign debt to the impact of reducing the external deficit on growth and employment
The dilemma facing US policymakers is how to stimulate growth while lowering the level of total debt
The most important way to achieve both objectives is to increase exports by strengthening US competitiveness
But where will increased competitiveness come from
Devaluation of the dollar could improve US competitiveness in the short run but it is not a solution
Because rapid fiscal deterioration now has investors worrying about capital losses on US government securities devaluation would make foreigners more hesitant to finance America budget deficit
If foreign financing is not forthcoming yields on US government debt will rise and the US economy will fall back into recession
In the long run America growth pattern must undergo a structural shift from reliance on debt and consumption one based on Americans vaunted capacity for creativity and innovation
Only then will America improve its competitiveness enough to allow the government to reduce both private and public debt to sustainable levels while maintaining a respectable growth rate
But neither improved competitiveness nor reduction of total debt can be achieved overnight
In the short run the US currentaccount deficit will remain regardless of which country runs bilateral surpluses
Thus China continued reinvestment of its currentaccount surplus in US government securities is of utmost important for US growth and financial stability
Given that America benefits mightily from China purchases of US government securities it is difficult to understand why the US government and Congress have been complaining so much about the bilateral currentaccount deficit
It is also difficult to grasp why China is so reluctant to reduce its bilateral surplus given meager returns on its massive holdings of US government securities and a sustained risk of large capital losses in the future
The good news is that following President Hu Jintao recent visit to Washington both America and China have been taking positive steps to resolve their differences over the bilateral currentaccount balance
That augurs well for a more rational and constructive SinoAmerican dialogue on global imbalances which would certainly benefit the global economy
A Banking Union Baby Step
BRUSSELS  At the beginning of the financial crisis it was said that banks were in Charles Goodhart crisp phrase nternational in life but national in death
At the time  large international banks had to be rescued by their home countries governments when they ran into trouble
But the problem now in Europe is the opposite banks are ational in life but European in death
In Spain for example local savings banks cajas financed an outsize realestate boom
As the boom turned to bust the losses threatened to overwhelm the capacity of the Spanish state and the problem became European because it threatened the very survival of the euro
The Spanish case is symptomatic of a larger problem
National supervisors always tend to minimize problems at home
Their instinct and their bureaucratic interest is to defend their countries ational champion banks abroad
But their resistance to recognizing problems at home runs even deeper
Until recently the Spanish authorities maintained that the problems in their country realestate sector were temporary
To acknowledge the truth would have meant admitting that for years they had overlooked the buildup of an unsustainable construction boom that now threatens to bankrupt the entire country
In the case of Ireland the situation was initially not much different
When problems started to surface the finance minister at the time initially claimed that the country would carry out he cheapest bank rescue ever
Given national supervisors predictable tendency not to recognize problems at home it seemed natural that the cost of cleaning up insolvent banks should also be borne at the national level
It thus seemed to make sense that even in the eurozone banking supervision remained largely national
The recently created European Banking Authority has only limited powers over national supervisors whose daily work is guided mainly by national considerations
But reality has shown that this approach is not tenable
Problems might originate at the national level but owing to monetary union they quickly threaten the stability of the entire eurozone banking system
At their June summit Europe leaders finally recognized the need to rectify this situation transferring responsibility for banking supervision in the eurozone to the European Central Bank
Given that financial integration is particularly strong within the monetary union putting the ECB in charge was an obvious choice
Moreover the ECB already bears de facto responsibility for the stability of the eurozone banking system
But until now it had to lend massive amounts to banks without being able to judge their soundness because all of that information was in the hands of national authorities who guarded it jealously and typically denied problems until it was too late
Putting the ECB in charge should also help to stop the creeping disintegration process which is not publicly visible but is very real nonetheless
Just ask any of the large international banking groups headquartered in financially stressed eurozone countries
Consider the case of a bank headquartered in Italy but with an important subsidiary in Germany
The German operations naturally generate a surplus of funds given that savings in Germany far exceed investment on average
The parent bank would like to use these funds to reinforce the group liquidity
But the German supervisory authorities consider Italy at risk and thus oppose any transfer of funds there
The supervisor of the home country Italy has the opposite interest
It would like to see the nternal capital market operate as much as possible
Here too it makes sense to have the ECB in charge as a neutral arbiter with respect to these opposing interests
But while putting the ECB in charge of banking supervision solves one problem it creates another can national authorities still be held responsible for saving banks that they no longer supervise
Economic and political logic requires that the eurozone will soon also need a common bank rescue fund
Officially this has not yet been acknowledged
But that is often the way that European integration proceeds an incomplete step in one area later requires further steps in related areas
This incremental approach has worked well in the past indeed today European Union resulted from it
But a financial crisis does not give policymakers the time that they once had to explain to voters why one step required another
They will have to walk much more quickly to save the euro
A Berlin Consensus
HONG KONG  A recent trip to Berlin brought back memories of an earlier visit in the summer of  when I was a poor student who marveled at the Wall that would divide and devastate an entire society for another two decades
Berlin today is vibrant and rejuvenated rebuilt by the German peoples hard work and sacrifice to unify the country and an apt setting for the conference of the Institute for New Economic Thinking INET which I was there to attend
The conference theme was aradigm Lost with more than  economists political scientists systems analysts and ecologists gathering to rethink economic and political theory for the challenges and uncertainty posed by growing inequality rising unemployment global financial disarray and climate change
Almost everyone agreed that the old paradigm of neoclassical economics was broken but there was no agreement on what can replace it
Nobel laureate Amartya Sen attributed the European crisis to four failures  political economic social and intellectual
The global financial crisis which began in  as a crisis of US subprime lending and has broadened into a European sovereigndebt and banking crisis has raised questions that we cannot answer owing to overspecialization and fragmentation of knowledge
And yet there is no denying that the world has become too intricate for any simple overarching theory to explain complex economic technological demographic and environmental shifts
In particular the rise of emerging markets has challenged traditional Western deductive and inductive logic
Deductive inference enables us to predict effects if we know the principles the rule and the cause
By inductive reasoning if we know the cause and effects we can infer the principles
Eastern thinking by contrast has been abductive moving from pragmatism to guessing the next steps
Abductive inference is pragmatic looking only at outcomes guessing at the rule and identifying the cause
Like history socialscientific theory is written by the victors and shaped by the context and challenges of its time
Freemarket thinking evolved from AngloSaxon theorists many from Scotland who migrated and colonized territories allowing fortunate individuals to assume that there were no limits to consumption
European continental thinking responding to urbanization and the need for social order emphasized institutional analysis of political economy
Thus the emergence of neoclassical economics in the nineteenth century was very much influenced by Newtonian and Cartesian physics moving from qualitative analysis to quantifying human behavior by assuming rational behavior and excluding uncertainty
This redetermined equilibrium thinking  reflected in the view that markets always selfcorrect  led to policy paralysis until the Great Depression when John Maynard Keynes argument for government intervention to address unemployment and output gaps gained traction
By the  the neoclassical generalequilibrium school captured Keynesian economics through realsector models that assumed that inance is a veil thereby becoming blind to financial markets destabilizing effects
Economists like Hyman Minsky who tried to correct this were largely ignored as Milton Friedman and others led the profession push for free markets and minimal government intervention
But then technology demographics and globalization brought dramatic new challenges that the neoclassical approach could not foresee
Even as the world advanced countries overconsumed through leveraging from derivative finance four billion of the world seven billion people began moving to middleincome status making huge demands on global resources and raising the issue of ecological sustainability
New thinking is required to manage these massive and systemic changes as well as the integration of giants like China and India into the modern world
A change of mindset is needed not just in the West but also in the East
In  the historian Ray Huang explained it for China
s the world enters the modern era most countries under internal and external pressure need to reconstruct themselves by substituting the mode of governance rooted in agrarian experience with a new set of rules based on commercehis is easier said than done
The renewal process could affect the top and bottom layers and inevitably it is necessary to recondition the institutional links between them
Comprehensive destruction is often the order and it may take decades to bring the work to completion
Using this macrohistorical framework we can see Japanese deflation European debt and even the Arab Spring as phases of systemic changes within complex structures that are interacting with one another in a new multipolar global system
We are witnessing simultaneous global convergence the narrowing of income wealth and knowledge gaps between countries and local divergence widening income wealth and knowledge gaps within countries
Adaptive systems struggle with order and creativity as they evolve
As the philosopher Bertrand Russell presciently put it ecurity and justice require centralized governmental control which must extend to the creation of a world government if it is to be effective
Progress on the contrary requires the utmost scope for personal initiative that is compatible with social order
A new wave of what the economist Joseph Schumpeter famously called reative destruction is under way even as central banks struggle to maintain stability by flooding markets with liquidity credit to business and households is shrinking
We live in an age of simultaneous fear of inflation and deflation of unprecedented prosperity amid growing inequality and of technological advancement and resource depletion
Meanwhile existing political systems promise good jobs sound governance a sustainable environment and social harmony without sacrifice  a paradise of selfinterested free riders that can be sustained only by sacrificing the natural environment and the welfare of future generations
We cannot postpone the pain of adjustment forever by printing money
Sustainability can be achieved only when the haves become willing to sacrifice for the havenots
The Washington Consensus of freemarket reforms for developing countries ended more than two decades ago
The INET conference in Berlin showed the need for a new one  a consensus that supports sacrifice in the interest of unity
Europe could use it
A Better and Safer Europe
To many myself included NATOs enlargement to take in among others the Baltic states of Estonia Latvia and Lithuania  which were once Soviet republics  is an impossible dream come true
When the idea was first floated some  years ago expansion into the Baltics was taken seriously by few people
Until recently Russias robust opposition to the idea posed a serious obstacle because it sharpened the impression that Russia regarded its socalled near abroad as a zone of special interest and influence
NATOs enlargement makes it crystal clear that no country in the new Europe can be regarded as part of another countrys zone
It assures the three small Baltic countries that the nightmare of occupation by big neighbors Hitlers Reich and Stalins USSR which they endured for halfacentury  will not be repeated
By putting paid to any revanchist tendencies in Russia concerning the Baltics Europe is made a safer place and Russia is helped in its effort to redefine itself as a national state and not an empire
Expansion will also create a better Europe because enlargement widens the territory in which countries are committed to NATOs political values including individual rights as well as the rights of minorities
Fortunately Russia now seems to grasp the value of this political aspect of NATOenlargement
Rightly so enlargement of NATO is not an expansion that threatens Russia or other countries which strive for democratic political reforms
On the contrary expansion takes away the worries  be they real or imagined  that surround the situation of the large Russianspeaking populations that now live outside of Russia but within the borders of the former Soviet Union
The civil rights of the Russian minorities in the Baltics and elsewhere are now enshrined in law due in no small part to NATO demands
Those civil rights initiatives on the part of NATO reflect the increasingly workmanlike way that Russia Europe and America now work out their disagreements
Indeed enlargement of NATO comes only a few days after a deal was struck between Russia and the EU on the tricky question of access to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad
This small piece of Russia with  million inhabitants and bordering on the Baltic Sea is squeezed between Poland and Lithuania two future members of the EU
This could have incited a complicated situation where Russians were faced with tough visa requirements when travelling between Kaliningrad and Russia proper
A deal was struck between President Putin and the EU that makes access much easier without compromising the status of Lithuania and Poland within the EUregime
This in turn created once again the kind of winwin situation that is so important for future relations between the EU and Russia
When the enlargement of the EU into Central and Eastern Europe is finally decided by the European Council in Copenhagen next month the conclusion is clear Europe has become a much better and safer place to live in thanks to the decisions taken by NATO and the EU during the crucial autumn of 
But this is no cause for complacency
For the really hard work is only now beginning dealing with all the internal practical and political problems that these enlargements will bring as well as reckoning with countries in the membership waiting rooms in particular Russia
Relations with Russia are of vital importance if Europe is to continue to improve the quality of life of its citizens and address concerns of safety
The common threat of international terrorism must be faced jointly
We need to convince each other that the fight against this common enemy has to be fought with a keen eye to balancing the needs of security with those of human and minority rights
Kaliningrad could be a litmus test of these relations
The first hurdle has been overcome with the agreement on access to the enclave
The next hurdle is to support Kalingrads fight against disease and crime as well as strengthening its economic and social structures
This calls for generosity from the EU and flexibility from Moscow
In a wider context this could lead to a strengthening of the socalled Northern Dimension of the EU where the goal is a free trade area to include all the countries around the Baltic Sea
Such a grand project can be achieved if the political will exists and asserts itself
Only a few years ago EU and NATO enlargement were regarded as wild dreams
But determination and political will has now made the dreams come true
Now is the time to set new ambitious goals for Europe
A Better Way to Reduce Nuclear Risks
In  when I served in President Jimmy Carters State Department I was sent to India to dissuade that countrys leaders from developing a nuclear bomb
My hosts replied that they needed to keep up with China
I said that Pakistan would inevitably follow suit and the world would become less safe
India promised that it would not export its weapons technology
So far as we know its leaders have kept their word
But revelations about the nuclear weapons smuggling network organized by A Q Khan the father of Pakistans bomb confirm the danger I predicted back then
Some call Khans network an effort to spread an Islamic bomb but given that North Korea was on the list of recipients along with Libya and Iran it might better be termed a corrupt bomb
As events in Pakistan illustrate the spread of nuclear technology does not extend the stability that comes with mutual deterrence
Rather it increases the prospects of corrupt leakage that may allow terrorist groups access to nuclear weapons
That makes everyone less safe
Any pathological group of extremists could destroy New Delhi Tokyo Paris or any city they chose
Now the worlds attention is focussed on Iran one recipient of Pakistani technology as the country seemingly keenest to create its own nuclear arsenal
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA Iran began enriching uranium at a pilot centrifuge plant last August and is constructing larger underground enrichment facilities
Iran proclaims that its programs are for peaceful generation of nuclear energy but inspectors have already found traces of highly enriched weaponsgrade uranium
Last October Mohamed El Baradei the head of the IAEA announced that Iran had accepted enhanced inspection procedures
In addition after visits by the French British and German foreign ministers Iran announced a temporary suspension of its enrichment program
Now it hints that it may resume enrichment and recent press reports about the imports from Pakistan suggest Iran failed to disclose everything to the IAEA
Iran claims that as a party to the NonProliferation Treaty it has the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes
Correct because the NPT was born with a loophole
Even if a country agrees to broad ranging IAEA inspections it can legally accumulate enriched uranium or reprocessed plutonium under the guise of a peaceful energy program and then suddenly declare that circumstances have changed and withdraw from the treaty  with the ability to produce nuclear weapons on short notice
If Iran did this it would not only add to the dangers in an unstable region but would likely begin a process of unravelling the nonproliferation regime worldwide
Iran may ask what right others have to demand that it forego nuclear weapons
The answer lies both in the fact that it promised not to do so when it signed the NPT and in the consequences that it would impose on others
For these reasons President Bush declared an Iranian nuclear weapon unacceptable
However Americas unilateral options are limited
Not only is the US military busy trying in Iraq but the way the US went into Iraq  which proved to have fewer nuclear capabilities than Iran  undermined American credibility making it difficult to recruit allies to contain Irans nuclear ambitions
Fortunately there is a multilateral option and an existing precedent
In the mids many parties to the NPT planned to import and develop enrichment and reprocessing facilities
Realizing the threat to the nonproliferation regime countries as diverse as the Soviet Union France Germany and Japan formed a Nuclear Suppliers Group that restrained the export of enrichment and reprocessing facilities
That plugged part of the loophole in the treaty without amending it
Today such countries should join together to offer Iran and others a deal
Countries that wish to develop nuclear energy but not nuclear bombs should be given international guarantees of fuel supply and disposal of spent fuel
For example Russia which is helping Iran construct a nuclear reactor at Bushehr should offer Iran a guarantee of low enriched uranium fuel and reprocessing of the reactors spent fuel by sending it back to Russia if Iran agrees to forego enrichment and reprocessing
This deal could then be given teeth by the UN Security Council
The Council would declare that further proliferation of nuclear weapons is a threat to peace and that any country moving in that direction is subject to sanctions
Such a resolution would also include a carrot by guaranteeing Iran access to the nondangerous parts of the nuclear energy fuel cycle
The pot could be further sweetened by offers to relax existing sanctions and provide a security guarantee if Iran remains nonnuclear
European foreign ministers have already expressed their concerns about Irans nuclear program
Russia indicates that it is willing to provide such fuel services
It is time for the Security Council to try to internationalize the most dangerous parts of the nuclear fuel cycle
It is not too late to learn the lessons of the misadventures of A Q Khan
A Big Chance for Small Farmers
NEW YORK  The G  billion initiative on smallholder agriculture launched at the group recent summit in Lquila Italy is a potentially historic breakthrough in the fight against hunger and extreme poverty
With serious management of the new funds food production in Africa will soar
Indeed the new initiative combined with others in health education and infrastructure could be the greatest step so far toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals the internationally agreed effort to reduce extreme poverty disease and hunger by half by  
During  I led the United Nations Millennium Project which aimed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals for thenUN Secretary General Kofi Annan
One cornerstone of the project was mallholder farmers meaning peasant farm families in Africa Latin America and Asia  working farms of around one hectare  acres or less
These are some of the poorest households in the world and ironically some of the hungriest as well despite being food producers
They are hungry because they lack the ability to buy highyield seeds fertilizer irrigation equipment and other tools needed to increase productivity
As a result their output is meager and insufficient for their subsistence
Their poverty causes low farm productivity and low farm productivity reinforces their poverty
It a vicious circle technically known as a poverty trap
The UN Millennium Project Hunger Task Force led by two worldleading scientists M S Swaminathan and Pedro Sanchez examined how to break this vicious circle
The Hunger Task Force determined that Africa could substantially increase its food production if help was given to smallholder farmers in the form of agricultural inputs The Millennium Project recommended a big increase in global funding for this purpose Drawing on that work and related scientific findings Annan launched a call in  for an African Green Revolution based on an expanded partnership between Africa and donor countries
Many of us notably current UN Secretary General Ban Kimoon have worked hard to make this possible with Ban repeatedly emphasizing the special emergency arising from the global food financial and energy crises of the past two years
The G announcement reflects these years of effort and of course the boost from the leadership of US President Barack Obama Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Zapatero Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd World Bank President Robert Zoellick European Commissioner Louis Michel European Parliamentarian Thijs Berman and others
Now the key is to make this effort work
The lessons of history are clear
Getting seed and fertilizer to smallholder farmers at highly subsidized prices or even free in some cases will make a lasting difference
Not only will food yields rise in the short term but farm households will use their higher incomes and better health to accumulate all sorts of assets cash balances soil nutrients farm animals and their children health and education
That boost in assets will in turn enable local credit markets such as microfinance to begin operating
Farmers will be able to buy inputs either out of their own cash or by borrowing against their improved creditworthiness
A consensus has now been reached on the need to assist smallholders but obstacles remain
Perhaps the main risk is that the id bureaucracies now trip over each other to try to get their hands on the  billion so that much of it gets taken up by meetings expert consultations overhead reports and further meetings
artnerships of donors can become an expensive end in themselves merely delaying real action
If donor governments really want results they should take the money out of the hands of thirty or more separate aid bureaucracies and pool it in one or two places the most logical being the World Bank in Washington and the International Fund for Agricultural Development IFAD in Rome
One or both of these agencies would then have an account with several billion dollars
Governments in hungerstricken regions especially Africa would then submit national action plans that would provide details on how they would use the donor funds to get highyield seeds fertilizer irrigation farm tools storage silos and local advice to impoverished farmers
An independent expert panel would review the national plans to verify their scientific and managerial coherence
Assuming that a plan passes muster the money to support it would quickly be disbursed
Afterward each national program would be monitored audited and evaluated
This approach is straightforward efficient accountable and scientifically sound
Two major recent success stories in aid have used this approach the Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunizations which successfully gets immunizations to young children and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS TB and Malaria which supports national action plans to battle these killer diseases
Both have saved millions of lives during the past decade and have paved the way to a new more efficient and scientifically sound method of development assistance
Not surprisingly many UN agencies and aid agencies in rich countries fight this approach
All too often the fight is about turf rather than about the most effective way to speed help to the poor
Obama Rudd Zapatero and other forwardthinking leaders can therefore make a huge difference by following up on their pledges at the G and insisting that the aid really works
The bureaucracies must be bypassed to get help to where it is needed in the soil tilled by the world poorest farm families
A Black and White Question
NEW YORK  In the afternoon of July  two men appeared to be breaking into a fine house in an expensive area of Cambridge Massachusetts
Alerted by a telephone call a policeman arrived smartly on the scene
He saw one black male standing inside the house and asked him to come out
The man refused
He was then told to identify himself
The man still refusing to step out said he was a Harvard professor showed his ID and warned the cop not to mess with him
He said something about black men in America being singled out and asked the cop who was white for his name and identification
The cop joined by several colleagues arrested the professor for disorderly conduct
We now know that the professor had broken into his own home with the help of his chauffeur because the door was jammed
What was unusual here was not the cop heavyhandedness
Most people in the US know that if you talk back to the police they will get nasty very fast
The fact that the man was black might or might not have made the cop go for his handcuffs even sooner than he might normally have done
That too would not have been unusual
What made this case special was that Henry Louis kip Gates is one of the most celebrated professors in the country famous for his books his articles and numerous television appearances
He is a grandee a mover and shaker in the academic and media world a friend of President Barack Obama
That is why he warned the cop Sgt James Crowley a veteran of the Cambridge police force not to mess with him
Class and race overlap in the US
In this instance it is impossible to pry them apart
Gates deeply conscious indeed a specialist of the terrible history of race relations in his country instinctively assumed that he was a victim of prejudice
From his words it appears that he was equally conscious of not getting the proper respect due to a distinguished Harvard professor and media celebrity
As he put it to his daughter in an interview published online Crowley should have gotten out of there and said  sorry sir good luck
Loved your television seriesheck with you later
Alas SgtCrowley had never heard of Professor Gates
A local man whose brothers all serve in the police force a sports fan and an amateur basketball coach Crowley does not move in the same social circles as Gates
As it happens the charges were duly dropped and there the case might have rested if President Obama tired and frustrated after weeks of fighting for his healthcare bill had not weighed in on behalf of his riend Gates and called the police tupid
Both he and Gates then spoke of earning from the incident
Gates might even be planning a television documentary on racial profiling
One thing to be learned if we didn know this already is how close racial sensitivities are to the surface of US life despite the election of a black president
The complexities of black anger white guilt and of black and white fear are so vexed that most Americans prefer not to talk about race at all
The field is too full of mines
One of Obama great achievements is that he made it into a serious topic through the brilliance and subtlety of his rhetoric
And there remains plenty to talk about the grotesquely disproportionate number of black men in US prisons the lack of educational opportunities in poor mostly black areas the appalling healthcare system and the very real brutality used by police officers against blacks who don have the privilege of a Harvard ID
It is probably true that many white policemen even if they are trained to avoid racial profiling as Sgt Crowley was need to be convinced that a black man can be at home in one of the finer houses of Cambridge or any other American city
But is the Gates affair the right way to enter into this discussion
One might argue that it
There is however a danger that it will have an adverse affect on the necessary national discussion about race
By having made such a big issue out of what was in fact a relatively minor event Gates could be accused of trivializing much worse instances of abuse
Indeed we don even know for certain whether this was such an instance
Crowley never mentioned the color of Gates skin
There was no question of violence
There were just very raw nerves and hypersensitivity to hints of disrespect on the part of the professor and of the cop
Outrage about a professor who is not to be messed with is not the best way to discuss the plight of countless poor anonymous people whom most of us find it too easy to ignore
A Bollywood Bride for Sarkozy
PARIS  Ever since French President Nicolas Sarkozy took himself off his country mosteligiblebachelor list by publicly acknowledging his affair with supermodelturnedpopmusician Carla Bruni during a romantic trip to Euro Disney he run into trouble
His ratings have dipped below  for the first time
Older French citizens don find the public spectacle of their leader in love very amusing
Abroad Egyptian lawmakers were so exercised over the prospect of the French head of state sharing a bed with his girlfriend that several vented their disapproval on the floor of the parliament
Likewise India is all in a quandary over how to handle protocol during Sarkozy impending visit to the subcontinent as the guest of honor at the country Republic Day celebrations on January 
Should the First Girlfriend have her own motorcade as a first lady would
Meanwhile the same hardright Hindu groups that protest Valentine Day as a decadent Western holiday have warned that if Sarkozy arrives with his girlfriend in tow theyl be out in the streets to welcome him
This controversy has threatened to cast a pall over a muchheralded summit between two of the world great democracies
With lucrative deals at stake for the bigticket products that drive the French economy  military hardware nuclear power plants and Airbus planes  France has a strong interest in a successful summit in India
So as rumors fly of secret marriage ceremonies either already concluded or in the works could the trouble brewing in India over the French president very public love life be behind the rush to have the couple legally wed
The news in Sarkozy favored media outlet
It erious the smitten president admitted
But he refused even under direct questioning by reporters to reveal an exact date
oul probably find out after it happened he taunted
Rumor has it the couple has set February  or  for the wedding Others say that Sarkozy has already outsmarted the media by secretly marrying in the Elysee Palace even as he was dodging wedding questions
If that is true then Sarkozy missed the romantic opportunity of a lifetime
If the couple sizzled for cameras with Luxor and Petra as the backdrop just imagine how hot things could get at the most romantic spot on Earth the Taj Mahal
And given the current rage for all things Bollywood in France a lavish Indian wedding would be fitting
Bruni own life path closely resembles any number of Bollywood stars who have made the transition from model to actress
A comely brunette who sings is perfect for a Bollywood makeover
The Indian government will be nothing if not relieved to see the first girlfriend made a wife
As one of India leading daily newspapers the
Despite the sometimes downright pornographic onscreen writhing of Bollywood starlets India is still a deeply conservative society
Divorce is anathema
Sarkozy is now twice divorced
And while mistresses abound among the privileged classes they do not strut publicly by their powermates sides
Kissing and fondling in public even by spouses is taboo
In this respect India more resembles the France with which Sarkozy wants to make a clean break than the current one
Most Indians as it seems many French would prefer not to shed the ypocrisy Sarkozy laments on the part of his predecessors read former French President Franois Mitterrand who had a child with his mistress about whom the public knew nothing until the man funeral
Sarkozy of all people should know that a large part of the gravitas of office derives from pomp and circumstance
Statecraft is a realm where appearances are meant to be deceiving
When Sarkozy who otherwise has such finely tuned media instincts protests that he no different from any other man he comes dangerously close to confusing the office and the person of the president
Most French people could only dream of an exotic wedding in India
Sarkozy could make that dream come true
If he really is as headoverheels in love with Bruni as he claims and plans to marry her imminently why not take advantage of his upcoming trip to India and make this a wedding to remember
He could meet his bride seated majestically on the caparison of an elaborately decorated elephant and she would look ravishing swathed and bejeweled in Indian finery
The lingbling president as Sarkozy has been dubbed can wear all the gold he wants and heap yet more diamonds on his bride
The cameras would roll Indians would smile and France would be treated to a Bollywood spectacle beyond its wildest dreams
And if it too late for the wedding there always the reception
A Bomb in Every Reactor
BERLIN  Twentyfive years after the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl the ongoing catastrophe at the Fukushima nuclear reactor in Japan has  it must be hoped  made clear once and for all that the purported blessings of the nuclear age are mere illusions nuclear power is neither clean nor safe nor cheap
Indeed the opposite is true
Nuclear power is saddled with three major unresolved risks plant safety nuclear waste and most menacing of all the risk of military proliferation
Moreover the alternatives to nuclear energy  and to fossil fuels  are well known and technically much more advanced and sustainable
Taking on nuclear risk is not a necessity it is a deliberate political choice
Fossilfuel and nuclear energy belong to the technological utopias of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries which were based on a belief in the innocence of the technologically feasible and on the fact that at the time only a minority of people worldwide largely in the West benefited from technological progress
By contrast the twentyfirst century will be informed by the realization that the global ecosystem and its resources which are indispensable for human survival are finite and that this implies an enduring responsibility to preserve what we have
Meeting this imperative entails both an enormous technological challenge and an opportunity to redefine the meaning of modernity
The energy future of nine billion people which is what the world population will be in the middle of the century lies neither in fossil fuels nor in nuclear energy but in renewable energy sources and dramatic improvements in energy efficiency
We already know this
Why then do the most advanced countries in particular take on the risk of a megacatastrophe by seeking to create energy from radioactive fission
The answer ultimately doesn lie with any civilian use of nuclear energy but first and foremost with its military applications
The energy derived from splitting uranium and plutonium atoms was originally used for the ultimate weapon the atomic bomb
Being a nuclear power provides sovereign states with protection and prestige
Even today the Bomb divides the world into two classes the few states have it and the many that do not
The old Cold War world order was based on the nuclear arms race between the two superpowers the United States and Soviet Union
To stop others from trying to become nuclear powers which would have multiplied and spread the risk of nuclear confrontation the NonProliferation Treaty NPT was framed in the 
To this day it governs the relationships between the nuclear powers and the rest of the world imposing renunciation on the havenots and nucleardisarmament obligations on the haves
Of course the NPT has repeatedly been violated or circumvented by states that never subscribed to it
To this day therefore the risk remains that the number of nuclear powers will increase particularly given small and medium powers hope to enhance their prestige and position in regional conflicts
Iran is the most current example of this
The nuclearization of these notalwaysstable states threatens to make the regional conflicts of the twentyfirst century much more dangerous and will also substantially increase the risk that nuclear weapons eventually end up in the hands of terrorists
Despite the NPT a clear separation between civilian and military use of nuclear energy hasn always worked or worked completely because the NPT rules permit all signatory states to develop and use  under international supervision  all of the components of the nuclear fuel cycle for civilian purposes
From here then all that is required to become a nuclear power are a few small technical steps and political leaders decision to take them
This political power not the requirements of energy policy is what makes giving up nuclear energy so difficult
As a rule the path to nuclearpower status always begins with socalled ivilian nuclear programs
The supposed ivilian nuclear ambitions of Iran have thus for instance led to a large number of such ivilian programs in neighboring states
Honni soit qui mal y pense
And of course the reactions of the nuclear powers to the disaster at Fukushima will be watched and analyzed closely by the socalled landestine threshold countries
So how will the world  first and foremost the main nuclear powers  react to the Fukushima disaster
Will the tide truly turn propelling the world towards nuclear disarmament and a future free of nuclear weapons
Or will we witness attempts to downplay the calamity and return to business as usual as soon as possible
Fukushima has presented the world with a farreaching fundamental choice
It was Japan the hightech country par excellence not the latterday Soviet Union that proved unable to take adequate precautions to avert disaster in four reactor blocks
What then will a future risk assessment look like if significantly less organized and developed countries begin  with the active assistance of the nuclear powers  to acquire civilian nuclearenergy capabilities
Any decision to continue as before would send an unambiguous message to the clandestine threshold countries that are secretly pursuing nuclear weapons despite lofty rhetoric and wordy documents the nuclear powers lack the political will to change course
Were they to abandon nuclear energy however their epochal change of heart would constitute a seminal contribution to global nuclear security  and thus to the fight against nuclear proliferation
A BornAgain CAP
WAGENINGEN NETHERLANDS  Born in  the Common Agricultural Policy CAP is now more than  years old and the European Commission is proposing what it calls a health check for its middleaged child
But superficial repairs will not meet the European Union future needs
The CAP must be born again
Work on its renewal is due to start now with the completed project ready in 
But a much more profound rethink is needed
The CAP original aim was to provide a secure source of food for the six original member states of the Union which were importers of food and sought a degree of selfsufficiency
Good healthy and cheap food had to be accessible for all citizens
Improved agricultural productivity would benefit rural areas and give farmers a comparative share in the Union growing wealth
Instruments to achieve those objectives were developed and food security was achieved
The CAP quickly came to be seen as the jewel in the crown of the European project
As the EU has evolved and expanded food systems have become more complex involving production processing supplychain organization and wholesale and retail distribution with all of these involving new issues like health and the environment
The use of land is also receiving more serious scrutiny
A  study by the Netherlands Scientific Council for Governmental Policy entitled
Those figures were for an EU of  countries so with today  members the possibilities are even greater
A Dutch analysis of land use has shown that by employing the best technical and ecological means on the best available land substantial gains could be made in food production
So it is not surprising that the number of farmers needed has fallen substantially
Viewed from the standpoint of food security and the wealth of rural areas there is now an urgent need to revisit the CAP main instruments so that a new policy formula can be introduced
Perverse subsidies must be removed and recent new ones favoring products such as biofuels reconsidered
The
A simplified CAP would encourage cleaner more productive and efficient agriculture
A side benefit for the EU standing in the world could be that the World Trade Organization stalled Doha negotiations could be restarted once farmers in developing countries are assured of getting a fair deal from Europe
Moreover the CAP role as a motor of political and social integration in Europe could be restored once renewed policies are in place
But renewal of this sort cannot be left to global market forces as the results might not necessarily benefit European agriculture and society
If the market isbehaves farmers could be reduced to poverty leading to the neglect of large areas of Europe
That is a real enough danger to which policymakers must give serious thought as they reform the CAP on the basis of the following five pillars
 The EU needs a knowledge and innovation policy that strengthens European agriculture competitiveness
Such a policy has been successful in the Netherlands substantially contributing to the development and power of the country agribusiness
Ten of  branches of Dutch agribusiness including horticultural seeds ornamentals seed potatoes and veal are among the top contributors to the national economy and the country trade balance
In the EU as a whole a policy directed toward research programs stimulating scientific excellence and greater coherence in the European knowledge system would greatly strengthen agriculture competitiveness and contribute to food security and sustainable development
 Europe also needs a restructuring policy for land use
Many structural improvement programs have been financed at the European level but agricultural production and land use are not among them
The development of an Agricultural Main Structure would compliment the European Ecological Main Structure
Reforestation and the repair of natural ecosystems should also be part of a land use policy
 A policy for European food systems would treat production processing distribution logistics and retailing in combination
Consumption patterns and preferences are an integral part of such systems
Preliminary studies by the European Science Foundation orward Look on European Food Systems could prove useful in devising an EUwide policy
 Metropolitan agriculture in a rapidly urbanizing world can provide highquality produce on small amounts of land
It offers an answer to rising demand for healthy food with minimal environmental side effects
 A new CAP should include a policy to safeguard Europe landscapes
But a cultural heritage should not be maintained everywhere nor should it ignore cost
And it should not be a defensive policy of the sort that tends to concentrate on poorquality land
These five pillars involve drastic choices but they will probably require less money from Europe taxpayers not more
They could make a real contribution to cleaner more productive and efficient farming and land use while addressing social needs
A Boycott Against Reason
t could happen here is the shorthand phrase frequently used for a variety of alarming hypothetical scenarios
ow could this happen here was the question more pertinently asked in Great Britain recently as its universities witnessed the unfolding of an alltooreal and perplexing action
In early June the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education NATFHE Britain largest academic union with  members passed a motion to sever ties with all Israeli professors and institutions of higher learning unless they publicly dissociate themselves from ontinuing Israeli apartheid policies
The motion was subsequently revoked but the fact that it was put forward at all is astonishing enough
Indeed the union call for a wholesale boycott contravened its most fundamental values the principle of academic freedom openness and exchange protection of research from state politics and the fundamental right to free speech
The motion implicitly adopted the yardstick of collective punishment and a distinctly McCarthyite tone demanding a sort of isloyalty oath from Israeli academics
What led scholars who are putatively the guardians of democratic freedoms to embrace measures so reminiscent of fascist and Stalinist tactics
Unfortunately the NATFHE effort is part of a larger phenomenon
In  the Association of University Teachers AUT called for a more limited boycott singling out Bar Ilan and Haifa Universities for opprobrium
Before that a petition signed by roughly  prominent British intellectuals and a few from other European countries demanded the cessation of European Union funding for Israeli cultural projects and institutions
These campaigns encouraged by Palestinian groups and nongovernmental organizations have been accompanied by individual acts of professional ostracism and an informal boycott of Israeli scholars publications and cultural projects already exists in some European circles
Such developments suggest an advanced and deeply disturbing trend whereby certain segments of the European intelligentsia are willing to violate their own beliefs in order to target one state for unique stigmatization and whereby insidious and sometimes illegal forms of discrimination against that state citizens are increasingly seen as acceptable
In a certain ideological mindset
In the putatively adical interpretation the relationship between Israel and the Palestinians is rarely seen as a conflict between two groups with sometimes tragically opposed interests
Rather the stubborn complexities of the situation are reduced to a stark struggle between absolute power and absolute powerlessness the archetypal oppressor and archetypal oppressed
The rhetoric applied to Israel becomes ever more extreme and conducive to hatred
Phrases like partheid state and ionism is racism unthinkable in liberal discourse a few years ago have become routine
At the same time the Palestinians become objects of romanticized identifications  one of the leaders of the NAFTHE motion was seen prior to a meeting draped in a Palestinian flag  and unwitting condescension
They are seen as the last pure cause the entirely innocent ther unimplicated in their fate and apparently deprived of political agency or choice
The possibility that the Palestinians are capable of deliberate decisions that they have adopted policies which may have contributed to the current situation or that they have exercised their own forms of power and violence is in this framework never admitted
Hamas was never mentioned in either of the university unions motions
This is Manicheanism of the left and like Manicheanism of the political right it can distort reality to the point of becoming divorced from it
Certainly the boycott efforts ignored basic facts
Unless British academics are ill informed they know that Israel far from being an partheid state has a large proportion of Arab citizens that Israeli universities are well integrated in some cases with considerable numbers of Arab students as well as a number  admittedly small and insufficiently representative  of Arab faculty that many universities sponsor collaborative projects with Palestinian and Arab colleagues that they are often sites of dissidence against government policies and that such dissidence even in radical forms is tolerated
Advocates of discriminatory measures often charge their opponents with stifling legitimate criticism of Israel
This argument is both disingenuous and dishonest
Many of the boycotts critics are also critical of Israel
But credible criticism must be based on evidence  and on generally applicable criteria of judgment
If the British unions wanted to be ethically consistent they should apply the same strategies to universities in the numerous countries where human rights are brutally abused and free speech suppressed
Some see this hostility to Israel as camouflaging oldfashioned antiSemitism
It is always risky to speculate about hidden motives nevertheless systematic disparagement of Israeli society and culture undoubtedly encourages the sense that antiSemitism too is a permitted prejudice
It is always easier to see a group or nation as a malevolent ther when this impulse is fed by an old and still potent prejudice
There is a deeper issue at stake
Democratic societies depend not only on the foundational principle of free speech but on the character of political thought and conversation among various constituencies
When the supposedly most enlightened and liberal of those constituencies resorts to illiberal discourse and intolerant measures tendencies toward bigotry and ideological irrationality are reinforced
The actions of the British academic unions have Israel as their obvious target
But their main effect may be an erosion of reasoned debate and civil conduct without which democracy is powerless against the forces of polarization and extremism
A Breakthrough Against Hunger
NEW YORK  Today world hunger crisis is unprecedentedly severe and requires urgent measures
Nearly one billion people are trapped in chronic hunger  perhaps  million more than two years ago
Spain is taking global leadership in combating hunger by inviting world leaders to Madrid in late January to move beyond words to action
With Spain leadership and United Nations Secretary General Ban Kimoon partnership several donor governments are proposing to pool their financial resources so that the world poorest farmers can grow more food and escape the poverty trap
The benefits of some donor help can be remarkable
Peasant farmers in Africa Haiti and other impoverished regions currently plant their crops without the benefit of highyield seed varieties and fertilizers
The result is a grain yield for example maize that is roughly onethird less than what could be achieved with better farm inputs
African farmers produce roughly one ton of grain per hectare compared with more than four tons per hectare in China where farmers use fertilizers heavily
African farmers know that they need fertilizer they just can afford it
With donor help they can
Not only do these farmers then feed their families but they also can begin to earn market income and to save for the future
By building up savings over a few years the farmers eventually become creditworthy or have enough cash to purchase vitally necessary inputs on their own
There is now widespread agreement on the need for increased donor financing for small farmers those with two hectares or less of land or impoverished pastoralists which is especially urgent in Africa
The UN Secretary General led a steering group last year that determined that African agriculture needs around  billion per year in donor financing  roughly four times the current total  with a heavy emphasis on improved seeds fertilizer irrigation systems and extension training
In addition to direct help for small farms donors should provide more help for the research and development needed to identify new highyielding seed varieties especially to breed plants that can withstand temporary flooding excess nitrogen salty soils crop pests and other challenges to sustainable food production
Helping the poor with today technologies while investing in future improved technologies is the optimum division of labor
This investment pays off wonderfully with research centers such as the International Rice Research Institute and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre providing the highyield seeds and innovative farming strategies that together triggered the Asian Green Revolution
These centers are not household names but they deserve to be
Their scientific breakthroughs have helped to feed the world and wel need more of them
Dozens of lowincome fooddeficit countries perhaps as many as  have elaborated urgent programs for increased food production by small farms but are currently held back by the lack of donor funding
These countries have appealed to the World Bank for financing and the Bank made a valiant effort in  to help through its new Global Food Crisis Response Program GFCRP
But the Bank does not yet have sufficient funds to meet these countries urgent needs and has had to ration assistance to a small fraction of the flows that could be effectively and reliably used
Hundreds of millions of people in the meantime remain trapped in hunger
Many individual donor countries have declared that they are now prepared to increase their financial support for smallholder agriculture but are searching for the appropriate mechanisms to do so
The current aid structures are inadequate
The more than  bilateral and multilateral donor agencies for agriculture are highly fragmented and of insufficient scale individually and collectively
Despite the dedicated efforts of many professionals the response to the hunger crisis remains utterly inadequate
The  planting seasons came and went with much too little additional help for impoverished small farmers
African countries search endlessly and mostly fruitlessly for the small amounts of funding needed for their purchases of fertilizer and improved seeds
My colleagues and I serving on an advisory committee for the Spanish initiative have recommended that donors pool their funds into a single international account which we call the Financial Coordination Mechanism FCM
These pooled funds would enable farmers in poor countries to obtain the fertilizer improved seed varieties and smallscale irrigation equipment that they urgently need
Poor countries would receive prompt and predictable financing for agricultural inputs from a single account rather than from dozens of distinct and fragmented donors
By pooling financial resources into a singledonor FCM aid programs administrative costs could be kept low the availability of aid flows could be assured and poor countries would not have to negotiate  times in order to receive help
The time for business as usual is over
The donors promised to double aid to Africa by  but are still far off track
Indeed during the past  years they actually cut aid for agriculture programs and only now are reversing course
Meanwhile a billion people go hungry each day
We need a breakthrough that is demonstrable public clear and convincing that can mobilize the public hearts and minds and that can demonstrate success
History can be made in Madrid at the end of January when the world richest and poorest countries converge to seek solutions to the global hunger crisis
The lives of the billion poorest people depend on it
A Breakthrough Opportunity for Global Health
NEW YORK  Every year millions of people die from preventable and treatable diseases especially in poor countries
In many cases lifesaving medicines can be cheaply massproduced but are sold at prices that block access to those who need them
And many die simply because there are no cures or vaccines because so little of the world valuable research talent and limited resources is devoted to addressing the diseases of the poor
This state of affairs represents a failure of economics and law that urgently needs to be corrected
The good news is that there are now opportunities for change most promisingly through an international effort headed by the World Health Organization that would begin to fix the broken intellectualproperty regime that is holding back the development and availability of cheap drugs
Two main problems limit the availability of medicines today
One is that they are very costly or more accurately the price charged for them is very high though the cost of producing them is but a fraction of that amount
Second drug development is geared toward maximizing profit not social benefit which skews efforts directed at the creation of medicines that are essential to human welfare
Because the poor have so little money to spend drug companies under current arrangements have little incentive to do research on the diseases that afflict them
It doesn have to be this way
Drug companies argue that high prices are necessary to fund research and development
But in the United States it is actually the government that finances most healthrelated research and development  directly through public support National Institutes of Health National Science Foundation and indirectly through public purchases of medicine both in the Medicare and Medicaid programs
Even the part that is not governmentfinanced is not a conventional market most individuals purchases of prescription medicines are covered by insurance
Government finances healthcare research because improved medicines are a public good
The resulting knowledge benefits everyone by stopping epidemics and limiting the economic and human toll of widespread illness
Efficiency requires sharing research as widely as possible as soon as it is available
Thomas Jefferson compared knowledge to candles when one is used to light another it does not diminish the light of the first
On the contrary everything becomes brighter
Yet in America and most of the world drug prices are still exorbitant and the spread of knowledge is tightly limited
That is because we have created a patent system that gives innovators a temporary monopoly over what they create which encourages them to hoard their knowledge lest they help a competitor
While this system does provide incentives for certain kinds of research by making innovation profitable it allows drug companies to drive up prices and the incentives do not necessarily correspond to social returns
In the healthcare sector it may be more profitable to devote research to a etoo drug than to the development of a treatment that really makes a difference
The patent system may even have adverse effects on innovation because while the most important input into any research is prior ideas the patent system encourages secrecy
A solution to both high prices and misdirected research is to replace the current model with a governmentsupported prize fund
With a prize system innovators are rewarded for new knowledge but they do not retain a monopoly on its use
That way the power of competitive markets can ensure that once a drug is developed it is made available at the lowest possible price  not at an inflated monopoly price
Fortunately some US lawmakers are taking a strong interest in this approach
The Prize Fund for HIVAIDS Act a congressional bill introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders is just such an initiative
His bill also contains an important provision aimed at encouraging opensource research which would move the current research model away from secrecy toward sharing
But globally our innovation system needs much bigger changes
The WHO efforts to encourage broad reforms at the international level are crucial
This spring the WHO released a report that recommends solutions similar to those proposed in the US Senate bill but on a global level
Importantly the report esearch and Development to Meet Health Needs in Developing Countries recommends a comprehensive approach including mandatory funding contributions from governments for research on developing countries health needs international coordination of healthcare priorities and implementation and a global observatory that would monitor where needs are greatest
In late May the international community will have a chance to begin implementing these ideas at the WHO World Health Assembly  a moment of hope for public health around the world
Reforming our innovation system is not just a matter of economics
It is in many cases a matter of life and death
It is therefore essential to delink RampD incentives from drug prices and to promote greater sharing of scientific knowledge
For America the Sanders bill marks important progress
For the world the WHO recommendations represent a onceinageneration opportunity to remedy a longstanding and egregious inequity in health care and more broadly to set a model for governance of global public goods befitting an era of globalization
We cannot afford to let this opportunity pass us by
India Change of Guard
SINGAPORE  In August Raghuram Rajan was appointed Governor of the Reserve Bank of India
On one level this was a routine announcement that many had anticipated  after all Rajan is arguably the bestknown Indian economist of his generation
On another level however his appointment can be seen as part of a broader generational shift
Rajan just  will be the first RBI governor born after India became a republic in 
Similar changes are taking place in all walks of Indian life including politics the arts sports and social development
And India will be better for it
Although the country is one of the youngest in the world with an average age of just  years until recently aging stalwarts incongruously dominated most fields from politics to the arts and even business and sports
But now younger entrants are rising everywhere bringing with them energy and new ideas
In politics as the country prepares for next year general election the leading contenders to replace yearold Prime Minister Manmohan Singh are the Bharatiya Janata Party Narendra Modi  and Rahul Gandhi who is just 
Either man would be the first prime minister who was not born in the British Raj
The arts were one of the first areas to witness this generational change
For a long time Indian literature especially in English was dominated by a clique who wrote mainly for a niche audience and literary recognition
Then a few years ago a group of young writers  such as Chetan Bhagat and Amish Tripathi both former bankers  changed the rules of the game by writing for the mass market
Rather than write for literary critics they began to use a simpler language including Indian turns of phrase
They also chose new themes Tripathi dipped into ancient mythology to write a trilogy about the god Shiva while Bhagat began to write about the lives of India young upwardly mobile middle class
Predictably the purists pounced and the critics ridiculed
But people have bought their books in the millions and film deals have followed
As a result the market for books has dramatically expanded and publishers have been forced to change their entire business strategies
Something similar has happened in the music industry
Previously dominated by a small cabal of singers and music directors the market has been transformed by TV talent contests similar to American Idol which provide a national showcase for the wealth of India talent
The shows have made participants some drawn from remote towns into overnight stars and many of them have gone on to sign lucrative careers
Thanks partly to this parade of new talent the Indian music industry is experiencing a period of extraordinary innovation and expansion
The output of the US and European music industries sounds stale in comparison owing to a dearth of innovation over the last two decades
Generational change has even come to India most popular sport  cricket
Such was the adulation once heaped upon its aging stars that many of them remained on the national team long past their peak
But a mere two years after winning the World Cup in  several members of that victorious team have been replaced  a decision that until recently would have seemed unthinkable
India social sector has also been transformed
Development policy used to be dominated by career activists wedded to socialistera thinking
But the arrival of new faces from the world of business such as Ashish Dhawan Jayant Sinha and Ramesh and Swati Ramanathan has meant that development issues are at last being assessed according to the problemsolving approach of social entrepreneurs rather than through the ideological lens of activists
Ironically it is the world of business that remains slow to change
The growth of the IT sector in the  seemed to promise that change would be rapid and farreaching but the old business families still dominate
There is hope though
Entrepreneurs like Manish Sabharwal of Teamlease and Binny and Sachin Bansal of Flipkart an online retailer are fundamentally changing the way India does business
Similarly Indian academia may be moribund but new public intellectuals like Pratap Bhanu Mehta have emerged from outside the mainstream
Yes India economy has slowed sharply the rupee has plunged and scandals and protests dominate the headlines
But behind the gloom a new generation is taking over bringing with it fresh ideas and visions for India

A Broken String of Pearls
China is revamping its energy supply Away from global trade routes and towards regional cooperation with Russia
In  the consultancy firm Booz Allen Hamilton coined a term for China energy supply strategy terming it a tring of Pearls
Loading barrels in the Middle East Chinese tankers travel half of the globe to their home ports and are escorted by Chinese vessels along the way
A complex network of alliances provides for supplies and happy sailors nights out
The earls are all those countries that are adjacent to the tankers sea lanes such as Pakistan Sri Lanka Bangladesh the Maldives and Burma
But what happens if Burma has the idea of turning a little more democratic and turn its head in the direction of Washington instead of Beijing
Would this mean that China string of pearls is broken and that the pearls are ready to roll in the direction of the US
As for Burma there is still a long road to go towards real political representation for its people
It is a good sign that the country rulers allowed opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi to take part to the April  elections leading her ational League for Democracy to grab  seats out of  seats that were up for election
Yet the power structure of the country is still largely militarycentric ground troops still account for the lion share in the state budget and control the obscure markets and trades of oil and gas
For the Chinese this may represent an abrupt geopolitical awakening
The international aspect of Burma reform agenda is as impressive as its domestic one since it may represent the first case in recent history of a country turning its back to China albeit just slightly after years of wooing the regime in Beijing
Several developments point in this direction most significantly the choice to let the national currency float the yat
This is to satisfy basic IMF demands and win Washington favor and it stands in contrast to Beijing astinstone approach of fixed exchange rates
Burma wants to have economic sanctions lifted and the country leadership seems to have concluded that an alliance with the US will compare favorably to a partnership with China
Obamas strategy is working nicely In November  he shook hands with Burmese President Thein Sein in Singapore during a meeting of the ssociation of Southeast Asian Nations
Somehow charm seemed to work
For the Chinese this may represent an abrupt geopolitical awakening
The basic rationale behind Burmese foreign policy is similar to what happened to the Soviet Union after WWII big undemocratic and nationalist powers are good at making friends with distant and developing countries
But if those countries are too close to the big power they start looking for another godfather to avoid being swallowed up politically
For China losing Burma has the potential of breaking the line that keeps the tring of Pearls strategy togetherThe string has never been a fullfledged structure but rather a trategic model to be pursued through progressive actions that ranged from financial assistance to navy maneuvers and the construction of military bases abroad
The tring of Pearls is already broken
Burma provides evidence of the fact that the tring of Pearls strategy is too unreliable for a country like China
The country has not been able to influence events in Iran despite the fact that China is one of Iran most important oil trading partners
In the case of Sudan geopolitical events and international pressure put Beijing oil ties with the African country at risk
The point is this Burma will not cause the tring of Pearls to break
The tring of Pearls is already broken because China has changed focus
Given the increasing and newlyreached energy independence of the US Washington  once again  is turning its attention away from the fossil fuel resources in Central Asia
In September  Putin placeholder Dmitry Medvedev and China President Hu Jintao signed a set of agreements after opening a pipeline that will supply the Chinese with Russian oil for some  years
In  the two countries had already signed contracts for a total value of some  billion US Dollars
And South America comes in focus as well with Brazil and Venezuela leading the way
Stefano Casertano The EuropeanMagazine
A Centerless Euro Cannot Hold
CAMBRIDGE  With youth unemployment touching  in eurozone countries such as Spain and Greece is a generation being sacrificed for the sake of a single currency that encompasses too diverse a group of countries to be sustainable
If so does enlarging the euro membership really serve Europe apparent goal of maximizing economic integration without necessarily achieving full political union
The good news is that economic research does have a few things to say about whether Europe should have a single currency
The bad news is that it has become increasingly clear that at least for large countries currency areas will be highly unstable unless they follow national borders
At a minimum currency unions require a confederation with far more centralized power over taxation and other policies than European leaders envision for the eurozone
What of Nobel Prize winner Robert Mundell famous  conjecture that national and currency borders need not significantly overlap
In his provocative American Economic Review paper  Theory of Optimum Currency Areas Mundell argued that as long as workers could move within a currency region to where the jobs were the region could afford to forgo the equilibrating mechanism of exchangerate adjustment
He credited another future Nobel Prize winner James Meade for having recognized the importance of labor mobility in earlier work but criticized Meade for interpreting the idea too stringently especially in the context of Europe nascent integration
Mundell did not emphasize financial crises but presumably labor mobility is more important today than ever
Not surprisingly workers are leaving the eurozone crisis countries but not necessarily for its stronger northern region
Instead Portuguese workers are fleeing to booming former colonies such as Brazil and Macau
Irish workers are leaving in droves to Canada Australia and the United States
Spanish workers are streaming into Romania which until recently had been a major source of agricultural labor in Spain
Still if intraeurozone mobility were anything like Mundell ideal today we would not be seeing  unemployment in Spain while Germany unemployment rate is below 
Later writers came to recognize that there are other essential criteria for a successful currency union which are difficult to achieve without deep political integration
Peter Kenen argued in the late  that without exchangerate movements as a shock absorber a currency union requires fiscal transfers as a way to share risk
For a normal country the national incometax system constitutes a huge automatic stabilizer across regions
In the US when oil prices go up incomes in Texas and Montana rise which means that these states then contribute more tax revenue to the federal budget thereby helping out the rest of the country
Europe of course has no significant centralized tax authority so this key automatic stabilizer is essentially absent
Some European academics tried to argue that there was no need for USlike fiscal transfers because any desired degree of risk sharing can in theory be achieved through financial markets
This claim was hugely misguided
Financial markets can be fragile and they provide little capacity for sharing risk related to labor income which constitutes the largest part of income in any advanced economy
Kenen was mainly concerned with shortterm transfers to smooth out cyclical bumpiness
But in a currency union with huge differences in income and development levels the short term can stretch out for a very long time
Many Germans today rightly feel that any system of fiscal transfers will morph into a permanent feeding tube much the way that northern Italy has been propping up southern Italy for the last century
Indeed more than  years on Western Germans still see no end in sight for the bills from German unification
Later Maurice Obstfeld pointed out that in addition to fiscal transfers a currency union needs clearly defined rules for the lender of last resort
Otherwise bank runs and debt panics will be rampant
Obstfeld had in mind a bailout mechanism for banks but it is now abundantly clear that one also needs a lender of last resort and a bankruptcy mechanism for states and municipalities
A logical corollary of the criteria set forth by Kenen and Obstfeld and even of Mundell labormobility criterion is that currency unions cannot survive without political legitimacy most likely involving regionwide popular elections
Europe leaders cannot carry out large transfers across countries indefinitely without a coherent European political framework
European policymakers today often complain that were it not for the US financial crisis the eurozone would be doing just fine
Perhaps they are right
But any financial system must be able to withstand shocks including big ones
Europe may never be an ptimum currency area by any standard
But without further profound political and economic integration  which may not end up including all current eurozone members  the euro may not make it even to the end of this decade
A Century of Chinese Protests
The Global Economy New Path
WASHINGTON DC  Whether we like it or not the world around us is in a state of constant change
But recent economic trends suggest that this change may be shifting its direction in a fundamental way
Consider the advanced economies
During the last two decades economic growth in these countries was led by consumption  so much so that economic activity in these economies swung from investment to consumption by a total of  percentage points of GDP
As a result in  the share of consumption in their GDP had reached 


In percent of GDP
Advanced economies
Consumption


Investment


Emerging and developing economies
Consumption


Investment


Meanwhile emerging markets and developing economies provided almost a mirror image of this trend raising their investment and boosting the supply of goods to the rest of the world at the cost of consumption in their own economies
By  the share of consumption in their GDP had declined from  to 
Looking forward it is unlikely that the consumption share of GDP can increase further in advanced economies
The main drivers of this increase were primarily financial engineering and wealth effects from strong asset prices
Neither of these factors currently is at play to push consumption share of GDP higher
But can the advanced economies consumption even be sustained at the current level
Perhaps not
Current levels of consumption are associated with overextended governments and households whose debt levels remain high implying that more savings are required
Banks also need to raise capital
In general many economic agents need an extended period of deleveraging
However current policies in the major advanced economies are aimed at maintaining current consumption levels in order to support growth and employment
If the consumption share of GDP nonetheless declines simple arithmetic tells us that investment and exports need to be higher to maintain total demand
Should we expect emerging markets and developing economies to pick up the slack
To sustain strong growth in these economies as external demand weakens domestic demand needs to become the major engine of growth
This means stronger domestic consumption and appropriate levels of investment to support such consumption growth
In economies where investment levels are leading to excess capacity resources could shift from investment to consumption provided that these countries external accounts remain sustainable
These are major tectonic shifts in the structure of the global economy and are fraught with potential dangers
The pace of change will vary between sectors and across economies leading to mismatches of demand and supply worldwide
Moreover with globalization an economic problem in one part of the world can be transmitted to the rest of the world more strongly substantially complicating policy responses in both advanced and developing economies
A study of such spillover effects by the International Monetary Fund suggests that before the global financial crisis external factors explained  of change in output in the five systemically important economies the eurozone the United States China Japan and the United Kingdom after the crisis however this share reached close to 
In the rest of the world including emerging markets the share of external factors in output change increased from about  to more than 
In this environment we must diligently pursue policy coordination at the global level
To achieve an orderly realignment of consumption and investment worldwide policies that boost investment in one part of the world should match policies that boost consumption in other parts
In particular advanced economies should implement fundamental productivityenhancing reforms the eurozone should strengthen the currency union and emerging market and developing economies should boost their domestic sources of growth
And these policies should be consistent with fiscal and external stability
Moreover financialsector policies and regulatory frameworks should be coordinated at the global level in order to design and implement consensusbased rules  thereby addressing the problems posed by very large global institutions that are considered too big or too complex to fail
Only with such global coordination can we reduce and possibly eliminate economic instability and disorderly adjustments both at home and abroad even as we seek to maximize the benefits of the inevitable changes in the global economy
A Chinese Champion of Peace and Freedom
PRAGUE  On Christmas Day last year one of China bestknown human rights activists the writer and university professor Liu Xiaobo was condemned to  years in prison
Liu is one of the main drafters of Charter  a petition inspired by Czechoslovakia Charter  calling on the Chinese government to adhere to its own laws and constitution and demanding the open election of public officials freedom of religion and expression and the abolition of ubversion laws
For his bravery and clarity of thought about China future Liu deserves the  Nobel Peace Prize
There are two reasons why we believe that Liu would be a worthy recipient of that prestigious award
First and foremost he stands in the tradition of Nobel Peace Prize laureates who have been recognized for their contribution to the struggle for human rights
Nobel laureates such as Martin Luther King Lech Walesa and Aung San Suu Kyi are but a few of the many examples that the Nobel Committee has recognized in previous years
We are convinced that the concepts that Liu and his colleagues put down on paper in December  are both universal and timeless
These ideals  respect for human rights and human dignity and the responsibility of citizens to ensure that their governments respect those rights  represent humanity highest aspirations
Should the Nobel Committee choose to recognize Liu courage and sacrifice in articulating these ideals it would not only draw global attention to the injustice of Liu year sentence
It would also help to amplify within China the universal and humanistic values for which Liu has spent so much of his life fighting
The second reason why Liu deserves the Nobel Peace Prize resonates with Alfred Nobel original intent for the award
In working to promote human rights political reform and democratization in China Liu has made a significant contribution to the values of peace and fraternity among nations that Nobel had in mind when he created the award more than a century ago
Of course democratization does not automatically guarantee better behavior on the world stage
But it does facilitate a full and rigorous public debate over key questions of a state foreign and domestic policies
This active and searching conversation the hallmark of a democratic polity is the best hope for better decisions by governments both at home and abroad
Liu committed advocacy on behalf of democracy in China is above all intended for the benefit of the Chinese people
But his courage and example may help to accelerate the dawn of the day when China participation in international affairs is aided by the expertise and oversight of civilsociety groups an independent media and an engaged citizenry able to express its views through the ballot box
It is primarily for these two reasons that we believe that Liu would be a worthy recipient of the  Nobel Peace Prize
In conferring on Liu one of the world highest honors the Committee would be signaling once again the importance of human rights and democracy on the one hand and world peace and international solidarity on the other
Liu harsh prison sentence was meant as an exemplary measure a stern warning to all other Chinese who might want to follow his path
We are convinced that there are moments when exemplary civic engagement such as Liu requires an exemplary response
Awarding him the Nobel Peace Prize is precisely the response that his courage deserves
A Civilization in Crisis
A Clarion Call for Emerging Markets
ITHACA  With  underway it is worth reflecting on how a decade of strong economic growth in emerging markets led to last year resounding political transformations
From the dramatic events in the Middle East to the groundswell of support for the anticorruption crusader Anna Hazare in India leaders in emerging markets are getting a clear message from the streets that growth is not everything
They ignore this message at their peril
Emergingmarket economies delivered solid growth during the  and even survived the global financial crisis without a growth collapse
But the specter of rising corruption is compromising the legitimacy of their economic gains and eroding support for further reforms needed to sustain their growth momentum
Corruption takes many forms but in emerging markets a combination of factors has turned it into a cancer that ultimately topples regimes
Relentless lowlevel corruption is a major irritant for poor people in many of these countries indeed it limits their access to the social services and basic government functions that they often depend upon for their very survival
Another type of corruption involves siphoning enormous sums of money from largescale projects
In India for example the government lost as much as  billion of muchneeded revenue when coveted band spectrum was sold through a rigged auction
For ordinary people largescale corruption is less visible because while the sums involved are mindboggling the costs are not as directly felt as they are in the case of lowerlevel graft
But the perception of this type of megacorruption has changed as rapid growth has increased inequality
In countries like China and India rapid economic growth has lifted a huge number of people out of poverty
But the fruits of globalization and rapid growth have not been evenly shared  the rich become superrich even as a large fraction of the population remains destitute
Rising income inequality is hardly limited to emerging markets but their combination of open corruption and pervasive inequities creates a toxic brew that is undermining support for reforms that would strengthen and consolidate their economic gains
In many emerging markets a lack of political freedom adds to the combustible mix
The combination of corruption inequality and political repression builds up enormous pressure and there are no institutional channels through which to release it
But freer political regimes are not a panacea
In a democracy like India the politically wellconnected benefit from skewed growth thus increasing the resentment of those left behind
The opportunity to hrow the rascals out in each election cycle helps to let off some steam but it does not resolve the problems that are generating it
It is difficult to predict what triggers popular protest but economic factors are key
For example rising food prices tend to hurt the poor especially the urban poor who spend a large share of their income on food unlike agricultural workers they receive none of the benefits of higher food prices
With swelling urban populations it will become increasingly difficult to keep a lid on these pressures
Some governments have reacted to recent events with political repression information blackouts or a combination of authoritarian measures
China for example blocked media coverage of the Egyptian protests
The Arab Spring however reveals the fragility of repressive political regimes that try to maintain their legitimacy by limiting information flows
The main lesson for dynamic emergingmarket countries is that an exclusive focus on GDP growth may ultimately not be good for economic and political stability
Even with rapid increases in national income if these countries leaders do not distribute the benefits fairly they will become vulnerable to popular discontent
Tackling corruption is critical to improving longterm growth and maintaining social stability
These economies need measures that help to keep the poor out of poverty traps and that give them realistic opportunities to improve their economic wellbeing
Such steps include broadening financial markets to give more people access to credit and investment strengthening social safety nets to protect the economically vulnerable and improving educational access and quality
These lessons apply equally to advanced economies which also suffer from rising inequality and subtle forms of corruption
But for those wealthy economies restoring decent growth is now the major priority
Emerging markets have a golden opportunity to build on their economic gains and lock in growth and stability by tackling deepseated problems like corruption
As the past year events have shown the costs of inaction could be calamitous
A Climate Deal is Not Enough
AMSTERDAM  During the COP climate summit in Copenhagen world leaders have been negotiating the future of our planet
All the signs suggest that they are unlikely to sign a global climate treaty
The views of the various countries and of the various industrial and political power blocs differ too much
The politicians civil servants and other participants at the Copenhagen summit have mainly been bombarding each other with numbers
Figures on how much various countries should reduce CO emissions the amount of money they should put up in coming years the exact nature of their responsibilities how much temperature increase Earth will be able to endure and how long we can continue to wait
These are all very important issues
But the mere figures are simply not enough
A different approach to the problem of climate change is needed
The climate issue can only be solved on the basis of shared deeply felt ethical principles
Humanity has reached a critical moment in Earth history at which peoples and nations will have to recognize their solidarity  with each other and with the Earth  and start acting upon it
Similar to the way world leaders adopted the United Nations Millennium Declaration in September  and embraced the resulting Millennium Development Goals today climate negotiators will have to commit themselves to creating a basis of shared fundamental ethical principles
Such a basis is not hard to find
Its inspiration can be the Earth Charter which launched in  was initiated by among others former USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev and Wangari Mathaai who received the  Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts in the Green Belt Movement a panAfrican treeplanting initiative
The climate problem does not stop at borders
In the next few decades a lowlying country like the Netherlands will need to invest billions of euros to intensify its ageold struggle against rising water
But in many other countries the water is already flooding over the dikes both literally and figuratively
Climate change affects particularly those countries that lack the money needed to take adequate measures against rising sea levels persistent droughts or devastating storms even though they had nothing to do with the primary cause of these problems  industrialization in the developed countries
Apart from the necessary often infrastructural adaptations to survive the effects of climate change enormous efforts to prevent even worse things from happening are required
Large investments in forestation agriculture and energy supply are called for
In devising solutions the role of women should be the main focus
Women are often the first people who have to address the problem of gaining access to natural resources and they are capable of playing a major role as pioneers in finding solutions to climate change and the way humankind should adapt to it
In the short term the world should become a sustainable global society of low CO emitters
This is a mission for all humankind in which patriotic feelings and thinking in terms of power blocs have no place
The pursuit of a sustainable global society of low CO emitters requires a tremendous effort
Precisely for this reason it also requires a broadly shared ethical basis
This would guide the negotiating parties in such a way that they look not only for solutions to a part of the problem but first and foremost at a comprehensive solution to the entire problem
The climate change issue is too important to be left in the care of politicians
In Copenhagen it is therefore imperative that not only nation states but the business community and citizens combine their efforts to save our planet climate
That is not only a scientific necessity it is an ethical imperative
A Clockwork Chemistry
OXFORD  In Anthony Burgess novella and Stanley Kubrick film A Clockwork Orange Alex an unrepentant psychopath has his eyes pried wide open and is forced to watch violent images
Like Pavlov dog Alex is being programmed to respond with nausea to violence and sex
This scene remains shocking but like most science fiction it has aged
The behaviorist psychology it drew upon has long expired and the fear that science will be used to make or even force people to be morally better now sounds oldfashioned
Science fiction ages fast but it has a long afterlife
Over the past decade an army of psychologists neuroscientists and evolutionary biologists has been busy trying to uncover the neural lockwork that underlies human morality
They have started to trace the evolutionary origins of prosocial sentiments such as empathy and have begun to uncover the genes that dispose some individuals to senseless violence and others to acts of altruism and the pathways in our brain that shape our ethical decisions
And to understand how something works is also to begin to see ways to modify and even control it
Indeed scientists have not only identified some of the brain pathways that shape our ethical decisions but also chemical substances that modulate this neural activity
A recent study has shown that the antidepressant Citalopram can change the responses of individuals to hypothetical moral dilemma scenarios
Individuals given the drug were less willing to sacrifice an individual to save the lives of several others
Another series of studies has shown that when the hormone oxytocin is administered via nasal spray it increases trusting and cooperative behavior within social groups but also decreases cooperation with those perceived as outsiders
Neuroscientists have even magnetically apped carefully targeted areas of people brains to influence their moral judgments in surprising ways  for example making it easier for them to lie
Of course no one is developing a oral pill that will transform us into saints
But the research is advancing fast and it is almost certain to suggest new ways to reshape our moral intuitions sentiments and motivations
Should we use our growing scientific understanding of the basis of human morality to try to make people morally better
A Clockwork Orange was accused of glorifying violence and some of its scenes are still hard to watch
But as Burgess himself argued the novella has an almost Christian message what makes us human is our freedom to choose both good and evil and for society to crush individuals into servile conformity is as wicked as and perhaps even worse than the sadism of psychopaths like Alex
I suspect that many will agree with this view
They will agree that our ability to distinguish right from wrong is something precious that we should safeguard not a broken clock that scientists should fix
Of course most of us don need to be conditioned to feel repulsed by rape or torture
But this does not mean that we are morally good or good enough
As you read this perfectly ordinary people somewhere in the world are doing unspeakable things to others
Even in the most advanced and affluent societies a vast concentrated effort is needed to preserve even minimal decency think of locks security alarms police courts and prisons
And it is doubtful that we really care enough about others or give enough to the less fortunate
Humans are born with the capacity to be moral but it is a limited capacity which is ill equipped to deal with the ethical complexities of the modern world
For thousands of years humans have relied on education persuasion social institutions and the threat of real or supernatural punishment to make people behave decently
We could all be morally better but it is clear that this traditional approach cannot take us much further
It is not as if people would suddenly begin to behave better if we just gave them more facts and statistics or better arguments
So we shouldn be too quick to dismiss the suggestion that science might help  in the first instance by helping us design more effective institutions more inspiring moral education or more persuasive ethical arguments
But science might also offer more direct ways of influencing our brains
Science fiction sometimes limits rather than expands our sense of what is possible
It would be selfdefeating or worse to try to promote morality through brutal coercion
Governments must not be given the power to control its citizens moral code  we know that if they had such power they would misuse it
It would be ideal if individuals could freely explore different ways to improve themselves whether by practicing mindfulness reading moral philosophy or yes by taking a orality pill
But it is also true that although some people are eager to take pills that make them feel better or think faster it is not so obvious that people would really want to take pills that would make them morally better
It is not clear that people really want to be morally better
And those who like the psychopathic Alex need the most help are probably those who would want it least
These are of course hypothetical questions
We don yet know what is possible
But it is better to begin the ethical discussion too early than too late
And even if oral pills are just science fiction they raise deep questions
Will we want to take them if they ever become available
And what does it say about us if we won
A Cloud over Airplane Safety
PRINCETON  When airports across Europe reopened after the closure caused by the eruption of Iceland Eyjafjallajkull volcano it was not because the amount of ash in the atmosphere had dropped but because the risk that the ash posed to airplane safety had been reassessed
Was it new scientific information that led to the lifting of the flight ban or was it a reflection of the hardship both personal and economic that the ban was causing
Over six days about  flights were canceled at a cost to airlines of more than  billion
An estimated five million people were stranded or delayed
The British economy lost  billion and others were similarly affected
Flower growers in Kenya who depend on air transport to take their shortlived product to Europe suddenly had no income
Sixteen cancer patients in critical need of bone marrow for transplants were put at risk because the matching marrow could not be flown in from the United States or Canada
In the past jets flying into ash from volcanoes in the US Indonesia the Philippines and Mexico have temporarily lost engine power and in one case dropped thousands of feet although all managed to land safely
But there was no evidence that the more widely dispersed ash blowing over Europe from Iceland would cause similar problems
The decision to ground flights was based on the view that any level of ash in the atmosphere posed some risk to aircraft and that no matter how slight that risk might be the government job was as British Prime Minister Gordon Brown put it o make sure that safety was paramount
Indeed in closing their skies European governments seem to have given safety absolute priority over everything else
Yet none of them act on that principle in other areas
Some  people die on the world roads every day
Cutting speed limits to say  kilometers per hour would prevent most accidents and save many lives
We don do it because we give safety a lower priority than our desire to spend less time driving
The price we are willing to pay for safety cannot be infinite
It is distasteful to put a price on human life but the more we spend on safety the less we will have for our other goals
The British government uses a figure of a little more than  million as a general limit to the amount it is prepared to pay to save a statistical life  for example by improving road safety
In the US the Department of Transportation is prepared to go up to  million  nearly four times as much at current exchange rates  for the same purpose
Does that mean that safety is paramount in the US but not in Britain
Giovanni Bisignani the head of the International Air Transport Association an industry group criticized the shutdown saying that no risk assessment had been undertaken
On the whole though the public seemed to support the decision
Stranded travelers interviewed at airports typically said that they would rather be stuck at an airport than in a plane falling out of the sky
But what if some travelers have a higher tolerance of risk or just a more urgent need to travel than others
John Stuart Mill in his classic book On Liberty considered a situation in which a man sets out to cross a bridge that we know is unsafe
In Mill view we are justified in stopping him only to make sure that he is aware of the danger
Once he knows of it the decision is his to make because only he can judge the importance of his journey and balance that against the risk he is running
Air safety is slightly different because a crashing plane can kill people on the ground but the greatest risks by far are borne by the passengers and crew
If they are fully informed of the risks and are still willing to fly  perhaps the crew has been offered more money as workers in dangerous occupations often are  should we prevent them from making the decision to fly
In the end after test flights with no passengers aboard had shown no engine damage and aircraft engine manufacturers told aviation authorities that their engines could operate safely with a low level of ash in the atmosphere Europe skies were reopened
The International Civil Aviation Authority has announced that it will convene a group of experts to help it provide guidance for the industry to decide what level of ash in the atmosphere makes it unsafe to fly
Now that we have seen the costs of giving absolute priority to safety we know that this is not only a technical question
I trust that among the experts will be some who have pondered the underlying ethical question how safe should we aim to be
A Communist Party without Communism
PRINCETON  Russian President Vladimir Putin anointment of Alexander Medvedev to succeed him in what is supposed to be a democratic presidential election next March shows that Russia leaders have not changed a whit
It looks increasingly likely that as under Leonid Brezhnev we will see the same names in the news for decades to come
According to Gleb Pavlovsky the Putin regime leading ideologist the current Russian system is perfect in all respects but one it doesn know its enemies
Indeed it seems as if everyone in the Kremlin is reading Carl Schmitt the Nazi legal theorist who taught that naming your enemy is the central mission of politics
In the spirit of Schmitt Putin men designated a liberal party the Union of Right Forces as their urenemy
Its public meetings were broken up by armed police its leaders arrested and beaten Putin called its supporters oyotes
What is surprising is that this aggressive behavior occurred in response to no visible danger
Oil prices are soaring as are Putin approval ratings
His appointees control everything that matters from Gazprom to the Central Electoral Committee
Since the pacification of Chechnya with violence and subsidies the incarceration or emigration of a few financially viable opponents and the massive ocial investments of recent years which under Medvedev personal supervision have bribed the population no credible force can seriously challenge Putin men
Yet their regime is in crisis and they know it
Russia economy is more dependent on gas and oil than ever before
Military reform has been reversed
Despite increasing incomes Russians are less educated and less healthy than they were when Putin came to power they still die at a shockingly young age
Russian involvement in world affairs is tainted by poison and corruption
State monopolies undo what private businesses created
With more money illeducated bureaucrats hire more illeducated bureaucrats as a result the regime fails to rule the country
The country is unruly and its rulers know it
So they panic
Putin aim was to subject all power to the control of Russia security forces
His generation of KGB officers watched the collapse of the Communist Party and all the governmental bodies that it irected and controlled including the KGB
Under Putin the security service has had its revenge
Its people have become powerful arrogant and enormously rich
They have also become disobedient
In  General Viktor Cherkesov then Putin representative in northwest Russia published an essay that glorified the KGB as the only unspoiled authority in a corrupted country
This essay more than anything else defined Putin second term
In October  Cherkesov now chief of one of the most obscure and powerful services the Federal AntiDrug Administration published another essay in which he lamented his colleagues degradation warriors had turned into traders he complained
Earlier generals from a competing service the FSB had arrested Cherkesov deputy for llegal bugging
In a public gesture of despair Cherkesov admitted the failure of Putin project to reanimate Russian governance by subordinating it to the security services
Cherkesov deputy remains in prison
Most believe that Putin is unable to intervene in his defense
In the absence of Communist Party control these security officers betrayed their corporate ethic and engaged in horsetrading applying force when a trade did not go well
That this happens to ordinary Russians is clear what Cherkesov revealed was that Putin circle also confronts this situation
What is to be done when exKGB warriors turn their swords and bugs against one another
Cherkesov case exemplifies Putin nightmare
But if your instincts betray you you go back to even deeper ones
Now that Putin people have left their predecessors neoliberal ideas behind and feel disenchanted with the exKGB clique the task is to recreate an omnipresent political party that controls the security services the administration business and much else
This party will be centralized under personal leadership and will reduce the state to a legal fiction
Preaching nationalism its managers will believe in their universal competence as opposed to KGBstyle professionalism and corporatism
Boris Yeltsin forbade party cells in statecontrolled institutions by decree
Putin lawyers will reverse that decision the party will have cells or committees in every factory corporation military unit university department etc
Integrated by the leader charisma and party discipline party members will direct and unify the desolated country
This is Putin plan
Like former Soviet leader Yuri Andropov the only other KGB man to rule Russia Putin will become the party general secretary
As in the Soviet era state and governmental officials will be reduced to party ciphers  the role that President Medvedev will play under General Secretary Putin
And of course being General Secretary carries no constitutional term limit
In the end Putin has what history left him not ideas just a faction yearning to consolidate its grip on power
Lenin and Trotsky needed a party to make their ideology a reality Putin and Medvedev are devising an ideology to solidify their party
It is a bizarre ideology
Accusing warriors of being traders and traders of being thieves it shuns its Marxist origins
It will subordinate all who really do work  traders warriors journalists and others  to party ideologues whose sole job is to search for enemies
A Confederal Solution for Palestine
LONDON  Last month while in New York City I happened to be staying in the same hotel as Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
To accommodate his security needs the hotel had been converted into a fortress much like Israel itself
Netanyahu was in the United States for yet another round of Middle East peace talks
The US offered various sweeteners to induce Israel to freeze its West Bank settlement construction for another  days
The Israelis refused another impasse was reached
What then might be the prospects of a negotiated peace between two peoples with claims to the same land
The answer is very poor
All peace efforts since the Oslo accords of  have been based on the wostate solution according to which Israel is supposed to turn over the occupied territories to a Palestinian state the Palestinians are supposed to renounce any claims on the Jewish state and everyone is supposed to live happily ever after
A negotiated and for peace solution still remains official Western doctrine
As US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put it in a recent speech  just lasting and comprehensive peace has to be based on wo states for two peoples
Meanwhile the two main parties to the dispute Palestine and Israel are searching for unilateral alternatives to the stymied eace process
The Palestinians are pushing for international recognition of their statehood while the Israelis are using their settlement policy to preempt a Palestinian state
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said that if the latest peace talks collapse he will press for UN recognition of a Palestinian state based on the  borders
This month Brazil and Argentina recognized alestine and a cascade of Latin American countries is expected to follow
Abbas is now setting his sights on Europe and would ask Turkey to serve as a gobetween
The game is to use international recognition of an independent Palestinian state to pressure the US to retreat from its almost unconditional support for Israeli policy
Israel main concern continues to be security
The official Western doctrine is that Israel longterm security depends on the success of the eace process
In practice Israel has been taking other measures to secure its future
Media attention has been focused on the ecurity wall which has certainly succeeded in reducing the level of violence
But to the hawks who now control Israeli politics the key to Israel security depends on depth of defense for which expansion of the settlements is indispensable
The hawks recipe for survival is threefold continued military and economic support from the US defensible frontiers through a strategic settlement program and the carveup of the Palestinian West Bank into disconnected bantustans or subordinate authorities incapable of concerted opposition to Israeli policy
Thus while Abbas seeks to create a new act on the ground by drumming up international support for a Palestinian state Israel aims to trump him by making such a state unviable
The ideal alternative to both strategies is a peace process that aims not to create two states but rather to establish the political and economic basis for a single confederal state
Indeed the twostate solution was always an illusion
There was never enough land to satisfy the passionate possessiveness of all those with claims to it
And over time Israeli settler disengagement from the West Bank and East Jerusalem has become just as impossible as any attempt by Israel to expel its remaining Arabs
Israeli Jews are bound to stay in the West Bank and East Jerusalem and Israeli Arabs are bound to stay in Israel proper
These are the acts on the ground that doom Palestinian hopes for a sovereign Palestinian state no less than Israeli hopes for a wholly Jewish state
Moreover land for peace never made sense from an economic point of view
If compensation for wrongs to the Palestinians was to be the guiding principle there were always better ways of going about it than to found a rickety povertyridden new country dependent on foreign aid
Most people have forgotten that the Paris Protocols of April  established a customs union between Israel and the occupied territories with a joint Economic Council to adjudicate trade disputes
The free movement of goods labor and capital between the two parts could have given a tremendous economic boost to Palestinian GDP
It could also have been the basis of a confederal state whose Palestinian part would have benefited from the West Bank settlers productivity and taxes
But this benign prospect was undermined by the violence needed to maintain the Jewish state and enable the emergence of a Palestinian one
The official view remains that only an internationally guaranteed twostate settlement will bring about the security needed for the economic revival of the Palestinian territories
But it is just possible that unilateral Israeli policy implicitly backed by the US will create interim conditions of peace that are sufficient for economic growth to cool Palestinian nationalism
The Palestinian cause is not the overriding preoccupation of even the Arab states so Netanyahu strategy of defense in depth stands a better chance of success than Abbas pursuit of statehood through international recognition
Netanyahu project is not moral
But that doesn mean that it won work at least for a time
A Confederation for Kosovo
Time is running out in Kosovo
If a United Nationsbacked settlement is not reached by early December the province majority Albanian population is likely to declare independence unilaterally  a move that the United States has announced it may support
That would be a disastrous step
Russia would be furious because it fears that Kosovo secession  whether or not it is internationally recognized  might fuel separatist movements in the former Soviet empire
Serbia is even more strongly opposed
Dusan Prorokovic Serbia state secretary for Kosovo has said that his country might use force to maintain its sovereignty
Even if the government hesitates ultranationalist groups might push Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica to send in troops the current UN presence in Kosovo is very thin only  ilitary observers and  policemen but the stationing of  NATO troops could make any armed clash very dangerous
After eight years of international administration Kosovo Albanian majority has tasted freedom and is eager for full independence
But Serbia claims that the province remains an essential part of its historical and cultural tradition
Moreover independence would not be accepted by the Serbian public which has already watched in dismay as reat Serbia has been gradually whittled away most recently with the secession of Montenegro
Serbia is prepared to concede only nhanced autonomy to Kosovo and some capacity to enter into international agreements
Yet while the two parties now seem irreconcilable it is not too late for compromise
But this is possible only by resuscitating  and updating  an old institution of the international community a confederation of states
By means of a binding UN Security Council resolution Kosovo could be granted full and exclusive authority over its citizens and territory as well as limited capacity for action on the international scene
It could be authorized to enter into trade agreements as well as agreements concerning individuals for example admission and circulation of foreigners or extradition plus the right to seek admission to the UN which does not require full sovereignty and independence
Kosovo would thus gain some essential trappings of statehood
However a decisionmaking body consisting of delegates from Kosovo Serbia and the European Union would be given full authority over major foreign policy issues for example alliances and relations with international economic institutions defence borders in case Kosovo wished to join with Albania and the treatment of Kosovo Serbian minority
As a result Kosovo and Serbia would constitute two distinct international subjects bound by a confederation hinging on a common decisionmaking body
Of course this confederation would be asymmetrical because the Serbian government sovereignty over the rest of Serbia would remain intact and unlimited whereas the Kosovar government overeignty over Kosovo would be restrained
To avoid one of the two parties getting the upper hand and imposing arbitrary decisions the common decisionmaking body should consist of four Serbian delegates two Kosovar delegates and three representatives of the EU thus requiring both sides to gain the support of the European delegates
In addition the EU should create a small but effective military force say  troops to back up the common body decisions
As with any compromise the contending parties would both gain and lose from this arrangement
Serbia would save face and would continue to have a say on crucial matters concerning Kosovo including the treatment of the Serbian minority
Kosovo would acquire limited independence with its status rising from a province of a sovereign state to an international subject capable of entering into certain agreements with other states and even joining the UN
The EU would benefit as well by contributing to the stabilization of a highly volatile area
Subsequently the EU would monitor Kosovo and prevent any dispute that might turn violent
A final advantage of this solution is that it would be temporary
Historically confederations sooner or later either become federations as occurred in the US Germany and Switzerland or pushed by centrifugal forces split up as with the United Arab Republic established in  which split three years later into Egypt and Syria
The confederation I advocate would thus constitute an intermediate stage lasting five or ten years at the end of which Kosovo is likely to become fully independent
Delaying a final solution in this way would provide time to verify Kosovo prospects of joining the EU and thus eventually sharing overeign authority with other independent states which could deflate Kosovars dangerously robust nationalistic demands
A Conservative Europe
Last week Tony Blair Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schroeder met in Berlin
They departed pledging to revive Europes growth
Weve heard that empty promise before
Instead the European Union needs a new direction
I say this as leader of the party which has been at the forefront of Britains engagement with Europe
It was a Conservative government that first applied for membership in the early s
A Conservative government took the United Kingdom into the European Economic Community in 
Margaret Thatcher worked with Jacques Delors to forge the Single Market in 
So I have no doubt that Britain must remain influential within the Union
But British policy towards the EU has often led to worse rather than better relations among member states
Faced with a new EU initiative our traditional response has often been to oppose it vote against it lose the vote then sulkily to adopt it while blaming everyone else
Many Europeans are sick of British vetoes
So am I
Of course there are basic requirements that all member states must accept
Foremost are the four freedoms of the single market free movement of goods services people and capital
But a single market does not require a single social or industrial policy far less a common taxation policy
Allowing countries to pursue their own policies in these areas encourages competitiveness
Forcing common standards means that Europe will fall further behind as member states shuffle their costs onto their neighbours
Which areas should be applied to every member state and which should be optional
I believe that every member state should administer those policies that do not directly and significantly affect other member states
In areas which serve their national interest individual members should decide whether to retain wholly national control or whether to coperate with others
The Unions members should form a series of overlapping circles different combinations of members should be able to pool their responsibilities in different areas of their own choosing
Precedents exist for this
NATO has been flexible since its inception
France signed up for membership but later refused to submit her armed forces to NATOs central command
Similar flexibility exists with the Euro the Schengen Agreement and the Social Chapter
These precedents can be extended
So far everyone has had to move forward together with individual countries negotiating specific optuts
But since  there has been a procedure within the Treaties  called enhanced coperation  that could allow some members to go ahead with further integration in a specific area without involving every other member
Instead of individual member states having fraught negotiations to optut of a new initiative those that support it can simply optn
Countries that want to integrate further can do so
They dont need to drag Britain and others kicking and screaming in their wake because the others are not compelled to join them
In this way we can break free of the institutionalised tug of war that has characterised EU relations
I am not talking about a twopeed Europe
That implies that we all agree on the destination and differ only about the speed of the journey
I dont want to reach the destination that some of our partners may aspire to
But I dont want to block their way
There are some who say that this would mean a loss of influence on the part of those countries which choose not to integrate more closely
But influence is not an end in itself  it is a means to an end
Britain does not need a seat at the table when decisions on the Euro are taken
Our economy has not been adversely affected by staying out
Keeping the pound does not mean that we oppose the Euro or hope for its failure
The European Union should stop trying to do everything and concentrate on doing fewer things more effectively
It should give member states the chance to develop an approach to Europe that suits their national traditions within the EU framework
It is on this basis that British Conservatives oppose the proposed constitution
We disagree with many of its contents of course but also oppose the idea of having an EU constitution at all
There is a world of difference between an association of nation states bound together by treaty and a single entity whether you call it a state or not with its own legal personality deriving its authority from its own constitution
If this constitution were accepted in anything like the proposed form the EU would gain many attributes and trappings of statehood its own president and foreign minister its own legal system
The supremacy of EU law would derive not from Acts of national Parliaments but from a supraational constitution
That is a radical change not the mere tidyingp exercise some suggest
I do not believe it is right to make a change of such magnitude without specifically consulting the people on whose behalf we govern
Elected parliaments do not own our liberties
They safeguard them and should not diminish those liberties without an explicit mandate
Any proposal for a new constitution must be put to the British people and to the people in each EU member state
A Conspiracy So Immense
NEW YORK  Is this the Age of the Conspiracy Theory
Plenty of evidence suggests that we are in something of a golden age for citizen speculation documentation and inference that takes shape  usually on the Internet  and spreads virally around the globe
In the process conspiracy theories are pulled from the margins of public discourse where they were generally consigned in the past and sometimes into the very heart of politics
I learned this by accident
Having written a book about the hijacking of executive power in the United States in the Bush years I found myself in researching new developments stumbling upon conversations online that embrace narratives of behindthescenes manipulation
There are some major themes
A frequent one in the US is that global elites are plotting  via the Bilderberg Group and the Council on Foreign Relations among others  to establish a ne World Government dominated by themselves rather than national governments
Sometimes more folkloric details come into play broadening the members of this cabal to include the Illuminati the Freemasons Rhodes Scholars or as always the Jews
The hallmarks of this narrative are familiar to anyone who has studied the transmission of certain story categories in times of crisis
In literary terms this conspiracy theory closely resembles The Protocols of the Elders of Zion  featuring secretive global elite with great power and wicked aims
Historically there tends to be the same set of themes fearsome uncontrolled transformative change led by educated urbanized cosmopolitans
Students of Weimar Germany know that sudden dislocations and shocks  rapid urbanization disruption of traditional family and social ties loosening of sexual restrictions and economic collapse  primed many Germans to become receptive to simplistic theories that seemed to address their confusion and offer a larger meaning to their suffering
Similarly the  Truth Movement asserts that alQaeda attack on the Twin Towers was an nside job
In the Muslim world there is a widespread conspiracy theory that the Israelis were behind those attacks and that all Jews who worked in the buildings stayed home that day
Usually conspiracy theories surface where people are poorly educated and a rigorous independent press is lacking
So why are such theories gaining adherents in the US and other affluent democracies nowadays
Today explosion of conspiracy theories has been stoked by the same conditions that drove their acceptance in the past rapid social change and profound economic uncertainty
A clearly designated nemy with an unmistakable lan is psychologically more comforting than the chaotic evolution of social norms and the workings  or failures  of unfettered capitalism
And while conspiracy theories are often patently irrational the questions they address are often healthy even if the answers are frequently unsourced or just plain wrong
In seeking answers these citizens are reacting rationally to irrational realities
Many citizens believe rightly that their mass media are failing to investigate and document abuses
Newspapers in most advanced countries are struggling or folding and investigative reporting is often the first thing they cut
Concentration of media ownership and control further fuels popular mistrust setting the stage for citizen investigation to enter the vacuum
Likewise in an age when corporate lobbyists have a free hand in shaping  if not drafting  public policies many people believe again rightly that their elected officials no longer represent them
Hence their impulse to believe in unseen forces
Finally even rational people have become more receptive to certain conspiracy theories because in the last eight years we actually have seen some sophisticated conspiracies
The Bush administration conspired to lead Americans and others into an illegal war using fabricated evidence to do so
Is it any wonder then that so many rational people are trying to make sense of a political reality that really has become unusually opaque
When even the  commissioners renounce their own conclusions because they were based on evidence derived from torture is it surprising that many want a second investigation
Frequently enough it is citizens digging at the margins of the discourse  pursuing such theories  who report on news that the mainstream media ignores
For example it took a onspiracy theorist Alex Jones to turn up documentation of microwave technologies to be used by police forces on US citizens The New Yorker confirmed the story much later  without crediting the original source
The mainstream media tendency to avoid checking out or reporting what is actually newsworthy in Internet conspiracy theories partly reflects class bias
Conspiracy theories are seen as vulgar and lowbrow
So even good critical questions or wellsourced data unearthed by citizen investigators tend to be regarded as radioactive to highly educated formal journalists
The real problem with this frantic conspiracy theorizing is that it leaves citizens emotionally agitated but without a solid ground of evidence upon which to base their worldview and without constructive directions in which to turn their emotions
This is why so many threads of discussion turn from potentially interesting citizen speculation to hate speech and paranoia
In a fevered environment without good editorial validation or tools for sourcing citizens can be preyed upon and whipped up by demagogues as we saw in recent weeks at Sarah Palin rallies after Internet theories painted Barack Obama as a terrorist or in league with terrorists
We need to change the flow of information in the Internet age
Citizens should be able more easily to leak information pitch stories and send leads to mainstream investigative reporters
They should organize new online entities in which they pay a fee for direct investigative reporting unmediated by corporate pressures
And citizen investigators should be trained in basic journalism finding good data confirming stories with two independent sources using quotes responsibly and eschewing anonymity  that is standing by their own bylines as conventional reporters do
This is how citizens can be taken  and take themselves  seriously as documenters and investigators of our common situation
In a time of official lies healthy investigative energy should shed light not just generate heat
A Constitutional Coup in Ukraine
Changing constitutions is always a risky business
But it is a downright dangerous one when undertaken to benefit one man alone
Indeed when a president volunteers to reduce the powers of his own office you can be certain that he is up to no good
That is exactly what is going on in Ukraine where President Leonid Kuchma proposes to junk our presidential system and replace it with a strange type of parliamentary system he has concocted
Kuchma has not suddenly converted to the view that parliamentary democracies are better than presidential ones
No Kuchma wants to change Ukraines constitution for no other reason than to maintain his grip on power
Today Kuchma rules as an allpowerful president
But his term ends next year and he cannot run again
So instead of retiring gracefully as presidents from Bill Clinton to Boris Yeltsin routinely do Kuchma wants to change the constitution in order to become an allpowerful prime minister who will never face a limit on the length of his term
Of course constitutions are not meant to protect the status quo if the status quo is rotten
Constitutions can and should accommodate reform when necessary
A powerful president however is not necessarily wrong for Ukraine
In our wrenching postcommunist transition it is essential that a government can act decisively
To change a system that seems best suited to Ukraines circumstances you need a good reason
The Ukraine president is authorized to appoint and sack the prime minister dissolve parliament if he wishes and rule by decree if he judges that the countrys institutions are in danger
He maintains daytoday control over every aspect of government
So
Kuchma is not
On the contrary what is rotten in Ukraine is not its constitution but its president who is mired in charges of corruption and orchestrating the murder of journalists and who is shunned by other world leaders
As president Kuchma is grotesquely unpopular
Even Slobodan Milosevic had more support in Yugoslavia before his fall
So Kuchma knows that he cannot rely on handpicking his successor as Yeltsin did in Russia
Unable to assure himself of a tame presidential successor Kuchma wants what he calls a parliamentary republic with a weak president and powerful prime minister
But the parliament he has in mind is a mutant one where the authoritarian rule of the criminal clans Kuchma controls will continue unabated behind the facade of parliamentary procedure
People too easily forget Ukraine this big country on the border of the soontobe enlarged European Union
But any attempt to prolong Kuchmas rule will create such a political mess that it is not absurd to fear that Ukraine could follow Belarus and the Balkans of the early s into outright dictatorship and chaos
Indeed this scenario could worsen because Russia is unlikely to sit around idly and watch Ukraine unravel
Intervention of some type seems more likely in such circumstances
Only an imperial Russia however would dare reabsorb Ukraine
But an imperial Russia cannot be a democratic Russia
So Kuchma endangers freedom and human rights not only in Ukraine but ultimately threatens Russias democracy as well
Luckily there has never been a better time for the Westparticularly the EUto nudge Ukraine back from the brink
With EU expansion coming next spring all Ukrainians fear that a new wall will cut their country off from the Unions easternmost border in Poland
Although the job of maintaining Ukraines democracy is primarily one for Ukrainians the EU can help if it takes practical steps to reassure Ukrainians that they wont be cut off from the rest of Europe
A generous visa regime and the use of regional development funds in Ukraine that will benefit impoverished eastern Poland are two possible inducements
But these should be made conditional on Kuchma leaving the countrys constitution and democracy alone
The EU should not fret about interfering in Ukraines domestic affairs
After all it hesitated little a few years ago to put a current member state Austria on notice that it was watching out for the welfare of that countrys democracy
The wayward Kuchma is far more deserving of Europe imposing safeguards to ensure his good behavior
Similarly the US should cast a wary eye at Kuchmas decision to send troops to Iraq
It cannot be the case that Americas fidelity to democracy in Ukraine can be so cynically purchased
Within Ukraine a government capable of truly governing should seek to adopt EU laws and norms in exactly the manner that the countries poised to join the Union have done thus helping to clean up the murky system in which Kuchmas criminal cronies flourish
The constitution must be reformed but not to shift power from one unaccountable leader to another
What is needed are clear checks on arbitrary rule and transparency in decisionmaking
No one should doubt that Kuchma intends to stay in power no matter what
Less certain is whether he will feel secure enough to hold a presidential election or any other kind of election if he cannot change the constitution in a way that guarantees his continued misrule
It is after all President Kuchma who is discredited not Ukraines constitutional arrangements
A Contagion of Bad Ideas
NEW YORK  The Great Recession of  has morphed into the North Atlantic Recession it is mainly Europe and the United States not the major emerging markets that have become mired in slow growth and high unemployment
And it is Europe and America that are marching alone and together to the denouement of a grand debacle
A busted bubble led to a massive Keynesian stimulus that averted a much deeper recession but that also fueled substantial budget deficits
The response  massive spending cuts  ensures that unacceptably high levels of unemployment a vast waste of resources and an oversupply of suffering will continue possibly for years
The European Union has finally committed itself to helping its financially distressed members
It had no choice with financial turmoil threatening to spread from small countries like Greece and Ireland to large ones like Italy and Spain the euro very survival was in growing jeopardy
Europe leaders recognized that distressed countries debts would become unmanageable unless their economies could grow and that growth could not be achieved without assistance
But even as Europe leaders promised that help was on the way they doubled down on the belief that noncrisis countries must cut spending
The resulting austerity will hinder Europe growth and thus that of its most distressed economies after all nothing would help Greece more than robust growth in its trading partners
And low growth will hurt tax revenues undermining the proclaimed goal of fiscal consolidation
The discussions before the crisis illustrated how little had been done to repair economic fundamentals
The European Central Bank vehement opposition to what is essential to all capitalist economies  the restructuring of failed or insolvent entities debt  is evidence of the continuing fragility of the Western banking system
The ECB argued that taxpayers should pick up the entire tab for Greece bad sovereign debt for fear that any privatesector involvement PSI would trigger a redit event which would force large payouts on creditdefault swaps CDSs possibly fueling further financial turmoil
But if that is a real fear for the ECB  if it is not merely acting on behalf of private lenders  surely it should have demanded that the banks have more capital
Likewise the ECB should have barred banks from the risky CDS market where they are held hostage to ratings agencies decisions about what constitutes a redit event
Indeed one positive achievement by European leaders at the recent Brussels summit was to begin the process of reining in both the ECB and the power of the American ratings agencies
Indeed the most curious aspect of the ECB position was its threat not to accept restructured government bonds as collateral if the ratings agencies decided that the restructuring should be classified as a credit event
The whole point of restructuring was to discharge debt and make the remainder more manageable
If the bonds were acceptable as collateral before the restructuring surely they were safer after the restructuring and thus equally acceptable
This episode serves as a reminder that central banks are political institutions with a political agenda and that independent central banks tend to be captured at least ognitively by the banks that they are supposed to regulate
And matters are little better on the other side of the Atlantic
There the extreme right threatened to shut down the US government confirming what game theory suggests when those who are irrationally committed to destruction if they don get their way confront rational individuals the former prevail
As a result President Barack Obama acquiesced in an unbalanced debtreduction strategy with no tax increases  not even for the millionaires who have done so well during the past two decades and not even by eliminating tax giveaways to oil companies which undermine economic efficiency and contribute to environmental degradation
Optimists argue that the short run macroeconomic impact of the deal to raise America debt ceiling and prevent sovereign default will be limited  roughly  billion in expenditure cuts in the coming year
But the payrolltax cut which put more than  billion into the pockets of ordinary Americans was not renewed and surely business anticipating the contractionary effects down the line will be even more reluctant to lend
The end of the stimulus itself is contractionary
And with housing prices continuing to fall GDP growth faltering and unemployment remaining stubbornly high one of six Americans who would like a fulltime job still cannot get one more stimulus not austerity is needed  for the sake of balancing the budget as well
The single most important driver of deficit growth is weak tax revenues owing to poor economic performance the single best remedy would be to put America back to work
The recent debt deal is a move in the wrong direction
There has been much concern about financial contagion between Europe and America
After all America financial mismanagement played an important role in triggering Europe problems and financial turmoil in Europe would not be good for the US  especially given the fragility of the US banking system and the continuing role it plays in nontransparent CDSs
But the real problem stems from another form of contagion bad ideas move easily across borders and misguided economic notions on both sides of the Atlantic have been reinforcing each other
The same will be true of the stagnation that those policies bring
A Cool Calculus of Global Warming
The British government recently issued the most comprehensive study to date of the economic costs and risks of global warming and of measures that might reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the hope of averting some of the direst consequences
Written under the leadership of Sir Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics who succeeded me as Chief Economist of the World Bank the report makes clear that the question is no longer whether we can afford to do anything about global warming but whether we can afford not to
The report proposes an agenda whose cost would be equivalent to just  of annual consumption but would save the world risk equivalent costs that are five times greater
The reported costs of global warming are higher than in earlier studies because it takes into account the mounting evidence that the process of global warming is highly complex and nonlinear with a nonnegligible chance that it may proceed much faster than had previously been thought and that the extent of warming may be much greater than had previously been thought
Indeed the study may actually significantly underestimate the costs for instance climate change may lead to more weather variability a possible disappearance or major shift of the Gulf Stream  of particular concern to Europe  and a flourishing of disease
When I served in  on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change the scientific group that periodically assesses the science of global warming there was overwhelming evidence that the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had increased markedly since the beginning of the industrial revolution that human activity had contributed significantly to those increases and that they would have profound effects on climate and sea levels
But few saw for instance the Artic ice cap melting as rapidly as now seems to be the case
Still some suggest that because we are not certain about how bad global warming will be we should do little or nothing
To me uncertainty should make us act more resolutely today not less
As one scientist friend puts it if you are driving on a mountain road approaching a cliff in a car whose brakes may fail and a fog bank rolls in should you drive more or less cautiously
Global warming is one of those rare instances where the scientific community is more fearful of what may be happening than the population at large
Scientists have glimpsed what the future may portend
As the Stern report points out as usual the poor are the most vulnerable
A third of Bangladesh will be underwater by the end of this century
The Maldives and a host of Pacific Island states will disappear our twentyfirstcentury Atlantis
To an economist the problem is obvious polluters are not paying the full costs of the damage they cause
Pollution is a global externality of enormous proportions
The advanced countries might mean Bangladesh and the disappearing island states no harm but no war could be more devastating
A global externality can best be dealt with by a globally agreed tax rate
This does not mean an increase in overall taxation but simply a substitution in each country of a pollution carbon tax for some current taxes
It makes much more sense to tax things that are bad like pollution than things that are good like savings and work
Although President George W Bush says he believes in markets in this case he has called for voluntary action
But it makes far more sense to use the force of markets  the power of incentives  than to rely on goodwill especially when it comes to oil companies that regard their sole objective as maximizing profits regardless of the cost to others
Exxon has reportedly been funding socalled think tanks to undermine confidence in the science of global warming just as the tobacco industry funded esearch to question the validity of statistical findings showing the link between smoking and cancer
Some companies even seem to celebrate the melting of the polar ice cap because it will reduce the cost of extracting the oil that lies beneath the Arctic Ocean
The good news is that there are many ways by which improved incentives could reduce emissions  partly by eliminating the myriad of subsidies for inefficient usages
The US subsidizes cornbased ethanol and imposes tariffs on sugarbased ethanol hidden in the tax code are billions of dollars of subsidies to the oil and gas industries
Most importantly price signals that show the true social costs of energy derived from fossil fuels will encourage innovation and conservation
Small changes in practices when replicated by hundreds of millions of people can make an enormous difference
For example simply changing the color of roofs in warm climates to reflect sunlight or planting trees around houses can lead to great savings on energy used for air conditioning
We have but one planet and should treasure it
Global warming is a risk that we simply cannot afford to ignore anymore
A Cool Head for the Hottest Issues
LONDON  Reading Barack Obama Dreams from My Father  the US president beautifully written reflections on his early life and identity most people are struck by his cool and intellectual approach
This is not to say that he is unemotional
Obama can rage and weep
But he rarely seems to act on the basis of raw sentiment or instinctive prejudice
Pragmatic and highly intelligent sooner or later every issue receives the full attention of his forensic curiosity
Recalling Hillary Clinton famous Democratic primary television advertisement Obama it turns out is exactly the sort of president that most of us would want to have in the post for that  am phone call about an international crisis
He would not be afraid to act but he would be prepared to think first
I do not think therefore that Obama will be too vexed by some of the criticism he faces at the end of his first year in office though he will undoubtedly grimace at the defeat of the Democratic candidate in the special election in Massachusetts to fill Ted Kennedy old seat
Obama was praised extravagantly a year ago  months on the criticism is over the top too
Obama inherited a terrible legacy  recession financial meltdown Iraq Afghanistan
He has not solved all of these problems
But it is difficult to see any really bad mistakes except perhaps allowing himself to be pushed around by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and giving China the impression that he was prepared for a bilateral relationship entirely on China terms
That seems to be changing now
Obama may have come to understand that when you are the leader of the world only superpower you need to be feared just a little if you are to be respected
The left in America criticizes Obama for not turning the economy around already
The right angrily denounces him as a cryptocommunist because he wants every American to have health care
With a dispassionate eye on the long game what will the president himself be thinking
One issue that Obama is certain to have in his sights is a problem that shadowed the world for years
When I was growing up in the  and  world peace was based on the nuclear standoff between the US and the Soviet Union
The main strategic assessment on both sides of the Berlin Wall was that if either side made a wrong move all of us might end up consumed in the flames of a nuclear holocaust
This was called in the geostrategic jargon of the day utually assured destruction or MAD
The acronym was entirely appropriate
We have forgotten those days
Yet there are still  nuclear warheads on our planet with the explosive power of  Hiroshima bombs
Terrorist groups would undoubtedly like to get their hands on one
In all there are eight nuclearweapon states  the US Russia Britain France China Israel India and Pakistan
North Korea may also have a few bombs
Iran is believed by many to be trying to develop one
Other states which have their own civil nuclear capacity have the potential to develop a weapon
The number of countries in this category is bound to increase as the number of nuclear power reactors doubles over the next  years
The Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty NPT has contained the number of nuclear states
A conference is to be held in May to renew and review it
Obama clearly recognizes that the NPT needs to be strengthened in order to prevent countries from turning their civil nuclearpower capacity into weapons
But Obama also knows that if the existing nuclear states want others to accept tougher restrictions they will have to cut back their nuclear arsenals
This is principally an issue for the US and Russia which possess  of the world nuclear weapons
In addition it would help if the US could take a strong lead by ratifying the Comprehensive NuclearTestBan Treaty
The nuclear issue is one of the biggest items on the Obama agenda
How it is handled will help to define his presidency
Even before the talking gets serious in May there will be the question of Iran to sort out
Iran says that it seeks no more than its own ability to produce nuclear power
Disbelief grows with every revelation of secret Iranian facilities and plans and with every refusal by Iran to negotiate safeguards that would allow for civil use while preventing weaponization
The US the European Union and Russia have tried to engage Iran on this issue so far without success
China seems likely to block effective sanctions on Iran because of its close energy relationship with the country
How China eventually handles this will profoundly affect its standing in the US and Europe
These are going to be some of the major questions for Obama over the next year and more
If he gets them right he can forget about his shortterm critics
Fortunately he is smart enough to know this
A Corporate Manifesto
Around the world countries are undergoing transitions to democracy
Although democratic development varies democratization always changes relations between business and government
In Mexico for example liberalization of elections expanded the oppositions representation in parliament ending domination of the executive over legislation and policy
Now small businesses have new opportunities to make their voices heard
In every country there are differences in interests and goals within the business community
Small firms have different interests from large multinationals in areas such as labor relations tax policy and health care
The degree to which business interests are fragmented based on policy issues cronyism or other factors often indicates the degree of distortion in the underlying market economy
One split divides firms dependent upon import protection from those engaged in international trade
In many countries protectionism nurtures hothouse industries that cannot compete in world markets
The influence that bureaucrats enjoy here fosters corruption
The result is a form of state socialism whose major beneficiary is a wellconnected business elite that excludes genuine entrepreneurs and their employees
Major differences also divide firms that remain publicly owned from those privatized as well as from those always private
Public sector firms have incentives to lobby for subsidies protection and cheap credit
They use their work forces to stall reform
Conversely private firms tend to support a more open and competitive economy and society
These splits have implications for how business can affect policymaking
Although every country and region is unique businesses can forge unified positions based on national goals and a common strategy
In some Latin American countries business organizations draw their members from the small business community companies engaged in international trade or business leaders who invest in new technologies
In some countries  say Nicaragua and El Salvador  economies had so worsened that nearly all business people joined in opposition to the status quo though disagreements existed about future goals
Their challenge was to unite many businesspersons and others to argue for opening the economy reforming fiscal and tax policies and other fundamental changes
In Mexico during the s COPARMEX the Mexican employers association was one of the few voluntary business associations
It opposed statist economic policies as well as the cats cradle of business government and the vast machinery of the Institutional Revolutionary Party PRI which governs Mexico
Throughout the s COPARMEX lobbied for Mexico to join GATT implement fiscal and tax reform and initiate a privatization process
Today COPARMEX is the leader in public educational meetings concerning the role of business in a democratic society communicating a public policy agenda and the need for free enterprise
As Latin America the Philippines and others abandon import substitution and adjust to the international market economy business interests change as well
According to Hernan Buchi an architect of Chiles economic reforms some of the strongest opposition came from governmentowned enterprises and firms engaged in business with the government
After Chile embarked upon market reforms those firms adapted in time
The public policy interests of business are not fixed shifting according to changes in the overall economy trends in domestic and international markets and the actions of business leaders
Such shifts occurred in India with the economic reform program begun by Rajiv Ghandi and deepened by finance minister Manmohan Singh
Several Indian businesses especially larger firms resisted clinging to benefits protectionist measures introduced under Nehru
Some firms  particularly companies interested in world markets and dependent upon imports  called for change
Over time the association of these companies grew and became the Confederation of Indian Industry
A vital tool to affect public policy is a national business agenda identifying the highest priority reforms
The agenda specifies the needed laws and regulations and offers concrete suggestions for change
For example the Federation of Egyptian Industry is working on a national agenda including

Analyzing policies and forming recommendations

Meeting with members in open forums to discuss alternatives

Publishing in the media to gain input from concerned parties

Formulating policy reform programs

Publicizing the agenda

Advocacy directed at government
Elsewhere the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce Industry Mines and Agriculture NACCIMA used its agenda over several years to coordinate economic reform
In  this task assumed critical importance due to the countrys opening to democracy
A legislative advisory program is another tool business can use to influence public policy
To shape legislation such programs require
 sound economic analysis and background papers readily available for technocrats and others to study
 calls to the countrys general interests as opposed to the interests of particular groups such as business or labor
 broad dissemination with arrangements made with the media in order to provide even wider coverage
In their attempts to affect public policy business organizations influence government personnel as well as legislators
In India although economic policy changes have been made statelevel government officials need to be convinced that reforms benefit their communities before they drop entrenched opposition
The New Delhibased PHD Chamber of Commerce has organized  businessgovernment dialogues throughout northern India to reach statelevel government officials senior business people and academics
The seminars
 instill a can do rather than cant do attitude among officials
 eliminate the antiprofit mentality
 expedite permits and licenses by creating onestop shops in state offices
In postcommunist countries where business is often deeply divided influence on public policy has been catalyzed through strategic coalitions
Romanias International Center for Entrepreneurial Studies ICES found that most business associations were captive to either governmentowned enterprises or to firms privatized by the former communist nomenklatura
ICES began to work with entrepreneurs and found that several sectoral associations  such as software  and small business associations from outlying areas of Romania were pushing for a market economy
However they were individually weak and unaware of each others efforts
During a training program on management the associations began to coalesce
Today SABAs members are implementing a detailed legislative advisory program
The manner in which business crafts its case can affect the likelihood of success
Business must define issues to attract popular attention
Job creation and economic growth are two essential lures
Other highly visible issues  corporate governance and combating corruption  also attract large followings
Indeed the Asian and Russian economic crises raised corporate governance to the first rank of policy issues
Interlocking relations among companies in South Korea Indonesia and elsewhere coupled with the lack of standards and requirement for disclosure were key factors in Asias crisis
The World Bank International Monetary Fund international investors and domestic constituencies are currently demanding change
Business organizations in many countries have a unique opportunity to step in and promote reform in order to help reshape the structure of their business environments
If they fail to do so the environment may be reshaped around them in adverse ways
Another strategy to advance economic reform is to combat corruption
Transparency International an international nonprofit organization is mobilizing a broad constituency behind efforts to reform government procurement systems by advocating a code of conduct for government purchases
Other groups fight corruption in their own countries
For example the Ecuadorian Association of Businessmen ANDE recently launched an anticorruption program that focused on the root causes of corruption
A survey of existing laws and regulations found that many of them were contradictory and overlapping
ANDE proposed creation of a new court by amending the constitution
It was successful due to strong public support for combating corruption
The new court is empowered to reconcile or revoke laws that contain conflicts and duplications
Each firm and business association must decide on the best strategies and tactics to pursue in their countries
The important thing is for business leaders to get together and respond to these challenges
A Crisis in Full Flight
MUNICH  For a while it looked as if the European Central Bank  trillion credit program to pump liquidity into Europe banking system had calmed global financial markets
But now interest rates for Italian and Spanish government bonds are on the rise again closing in on about 
Of course this may not be the breaking point beyond which the debt burden becomes unsustainable
After all interest rates in Southern Europe were well above  in the decade before the euro was introduced
Even Germany at that time had to pay bondholders more than 
Nevertheless the markets are clearly signaling growing doubt about whether Spain and Italy will be willing to bear their debt burden
The main problem is Spain where private and publicsector foreign debt is larger than that of Greece Portugal Ireland and Italy combined and as in Greece is in the neighborhood of  of GDP  to be precise
A quarter of the labor force and half of Spain youth are unemployed reflecting the country loss of competitiveness in the wake of the realestate bubble inflated by cheap euro credit in the precrisis period
The currentaccount deficit remains at  of GDP despite the recessioninduced decline in imports while economic contraction will cause Spain to miss its budgetdeficit target again
Moreover Spain debt with the ECB TARGET settlement system rose by  billion  billion between February and March because capital outflows of that amount had to be compensated
Since July  Spain TARGET debt has grown by  billion
Capital is in full flight more than offsetting the inflows from 
The cumulative total since the beginning of the first crisis year  means that Spain has financed its entire currentaccount deficit via the printing press
The picture is little better in Italy where the currentaccount balance has swung from a surplus of around  of GDP to a ofGDP deficit over the last ten years
The country TARGET debt grew by  billion from February to March with the total since July  reaching  billion
Italy too is being drained of capital in fact the flight of investors accelerated after the ECB liquidity injection
It is now clear that the ECB itself has caused a large part of the capital flight from countries like Spain and Italy because the cheap credit that it offered drove away private capital
The purpose of the ECB measures was to reestablish confidence and bring about a recovery of the interbank market
In this too it has not really been successful despite the huge amount of money that it put on the table
Indeed now the French are looking wobbly
As capital fled the country between July  and January  France TARGET debt increased by  billion
France too has become uncompetitive owing to the cheap credit brought by the euro in its initial years
According to a recent study by Goldman Sachs the country price level must drop by an estimated  visvis the euro average  that is depreciate in real terms  if the economy is to regain competitiveness within the eurozone
Italy will have to depreciate by  and Spain by roughly 
While Greece and Portugal face the need for deflation totaling  and  respectively the figures for Spain and Italy are high enough to justify fears about the future development of the eurozone
These imbalances can be redressed only with great effort if at all and only if one accepts a decade of stagnation
For Greece and Portugal staying in the eurozone will be a tight squeeze
There are many who would solve the problem by routing more and more cheap credit through public channels  bailout funds eurobonds or the ECB  from the eurozone healthy core to the troubled South
But this would unfairly force savers and taxpayers in the core countries to provide capital to the South on terms to which they would never voluntarily agree
Already German Dutch and Finish savings amounting to   and  respectively per working person have been converted from marketable investments into mere equalization claims against the ECB
No one knows what these claims will be worth in the event of a eurozone breakup
Above all however the permanent public provision of cheap credit would ultimately lead to a lingering infirmity if not to Europe economic collapse because the eurozone would become a central management system with state control over investment
Such systems cannot work because they eliminate the capital market as the economic system main steering mechanism
One cannot help but wonder how thoughtlessly Europe politicians have started down this slippery slope
A Crisis in Two Narratives
CHICAGO  With the world industrial democracies in crisis two competing narratives of its sources  and appropriate remedies  are emerging
The first betterknown diagnosis is that demand has collapsed because of high debt accumulated prior to the crisis
Households and countries that were most prone to spend cannot borrow any more
To revive growth others must be encouraged to spend  governments that can still borrow should run larger deficits and rockbottom interest rates should discourage thrifty households from saving
Under these circumstances budgetary recklessness is a virtue at least in the short term
In the medium term once growth revives debt can be paid down and the financial sector curbed so that it does not inflict another crisis on the world
This narrative  the standard Keynesian line modified for a debt crisis  is the one to which most government officials central bankers and Wall Street economists have subscribed and needs little elaboration
Its virtue is that it gives policymakers something clear to do with promised returns that match the political cycle
Unfortunately despite past stimulus growth is still tepid and it is increasingly difficult to find sensible new spending that can pay off in the short run
Attention is therefore shifting to the second narrative which suggests that the advanced economies fundamental capacity to grow by making useful things has been declining for decades a trend that was masked by debtfueled spending
More such spending will not return these countries to a sustainable growth path
Instead they must improve the environment for growth
The second narrative starts with the  and  an era of rapid growth in the West and Japan
Several factors including postwar reconstruction the resurgence of trade after the protectionist  the introduction of new technologies in power transport and communications across countries and expansion of educational attainment underpinned the long boom
But as Tyler Cowen has argued in his book The Great Stagnation once these owhanging fruit were plucked it became much harder to propel growth from the  onward
Meanwhile as Wolfgang Streeck writes persuasively in New Left Review democratic governments facing what seemed in the  like an endless vista of innovation and growth were quick to expand the welfare state
But when growth faltered this meant that government spending expanded even as its resources shrank
For a while central banks accommodated that spending
The resulting high inflation created widespread discontent especially because little growth resulted
Faith in Keynesian stimulus diminished though high inflation did reduce publicdebt levels
Central banks then began to focus on low and stable inflation as their primary objective and became more independent from their political masters
But deficit spending by governments continued apace and public debt as a share of GDP in industrial countries climbed steadily from the late  this time without inflation to reduce its real value
Recognizing the need to find new sources of growth towards the end of Jimmy Carter presidency and then under Ronald Reagan the United States deregulated industry and the financial sector as did Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom
Productivity growth increased substantially in these countries over time which persuaded Continental Europe to adopt reforms of its own often pushed by the European Commission
Yet even this growth was not enough given previous governments generous promises of health care and pensions  promises made even less tenable by rising life expectancy and falling birth rates
Public debt continued to grow
And the incomes of the moderately educated middle class failed to benefit from deregulationled growth though it improved their lot as consumers
The most recent phase of the advanced economies frenzied search for growth took different forms
In some countries most notably the US a privatesector credit boom created jobs in lowskilled industries like construction and precipitated a consumption boom as people borrowed against overvalued houses
In other countries like Greece as well as under regional administrations in Italy and Spain a governmentled hiring spree created secure jobs for the moderately educated
In this undamental narrative the advanced countries precrisis GDP was unsustainable bolstered by borrowing and unproductive makework jobs
More borrowed growth  the Keynesian formula  may create the illusion of normalcy and may be useful in the immediate aftermath of a deep crisis to calm a panic but it is no solution to a fundamental growth problem
If this diagnosis is correct advanced countries need to focus on reviving innovation and productivity growth over the medium term and on realigning welfare promises with revenue capacity while alleviating the pain of the truly destitute in the short run
For example Southern Europe growth potential may consist in deregulating service sectors and reducing employment protection to spur creation of more privatesector jobs for retrenched government workers and unemployed youth
In the US the imperative is to improve the match between potential jobs and worker skills
People understand better than the government what they need and are acting accordingly
Many women for example are leaving lowpaying jobs to acquire skills that will open doors to higherpaying positions
Too little government attention has been focused on such issues partly because payoffs occur beyond electoral horizons and partly because the effectiveness of government programs has been mixed
Tax reform however can provide spur retraining and maintain incentives to work even while fixing gaping fiscal holes
Three powerful forces one hopes will help to create more productive jobs in the future better use of information and communications technology and new ways to make it pay lowercost energy as alternative sources are harnessed and sharply rising demand in emerging markets for highervalueadded goods
The advanced countries have a choice
They can act as if all is well except that their consumers are in a funk and that nimal spirits must be revived through stimulus
Or they can treat the crisis as a wakeup call to fix what debt has papered over in the last few decades
For better or worse the narrative that persuades these countries governments and publics will determine their future nbspand that of the global economy
A Crisis of Democracy
As the latest controversial austerity measures were passed by Greek MPs on Sunday evening Athens was in flames
With tens of thousands of protestors massing outside the parliament building during the crunch vote longrunning tensions over proposed cuts and declining standards of living burst forth into civil unrest
Stones clattered against police riot shields petrol bombs were hurled through the air and shouts of anger and frustration echoed through streets teeming with burning buildings
In a speech delivered shortly before the vote Prime Minister Lucas Papademos sounded a defiant note against the fury raging outside
andalism violence and destruction have no place in a democratic society he claimed while urging support for measures that would et the foundations for the reform and recovery of the economy
But while many Eurozone leaders relieved by parliament approval of the austerity measures find themselves entirely in agreement with Papademos the majority of Greeks are left asking whether the increasingly hopeless pursuit of economic recovery has done irreparable damage to Greek democracy
Has the management of the economy taken precedence over the representation of the people
For Papademos and the majority of his cabinet colleagues there is no tradeoff between democracy and economic stabilisation
As Papademos predecessor George Papandreou frequently observed during his illfated premiership the interests of the Greek people are best served by securing muchneeded aid from the country European partners and by attempting to lay the foundations for economic recovery
As representatives of the people the Greek government has an obligation to work in their best interests in this most severe of crises
The only problem is that not everyone shares this perspective
For a growing number of Greeks the Eurozone demands for further cuts have overshadowed democratic representation
It is not difficult to see why the conditions which Eurozone leaders laid down for the transfer of the next tranche of the bailout might appear to be inappropriate impositions foisted upon Greece by countries preoccupied with their own interests
Given the scale of Greece sovereign debt it is far from clear that austerity measures actually can rescue the country from bankruptcy
And given that investment has already declined to the point that poverty has become rife it is hard to believe that the public interest is best served by lowering the minimum wage and cutting  publicsector jobs in the vain hope of staving off Greece allbutinevitable withdrawal from the Euro
One could certainly be forgiven for thinking that ordinary Greeks are being forced to suffer financial hardship by an unrealistic government in thrall to the troika
Inevitably this carries with it the sense that Papademos government has ceased to represent the people
Many Greeks  particularly small businessmen blue collar workers the unemployed and trades unionists  believe that the immediate problem of jobs and the falling standard of living should be the priority
Rather than cutting off its nose to spite its face in attempting to salvage an increasingly unsalvageable debt Greece should resign itself to an inevitable default and concentrate on taking care of its people as best it can in the short term
But if this is the will of many Greeks Papademos is simply not listening
A poll published in the daily Kathimerini on February  revealed that a staggering  of Greeks believe that Papademos government is heading in the rong direction and that austerity measures are almost universally condemned
The  MPs who voted against the austerity package on Sunday notwithstanding Greece parliamentarians do indeed seem to have overlooked their obligation to represent the wishes of ordinary voters
Perhaps Papademos would choose to represent this as a new manifestation of a classic problem do the people really know where their best interests lie
But while it a tempting question to ask the simple fact is that a representative democracy does not require elected representatives to judge the quality of the people wishes
They are simply required to represent the people for better or for worse
Whether the austerity measures do indeed represent the best hope for Greece recovery or not parliamentarians have an absolute obligation to respect the wishes of the people even if this means throwing out the reform package and sacrificing the next tranche of the bailout
That simply put is democracy and Greece it seems is experiencing a crisis of democracy
But if Greece government have indeed prioritised questionable economic management over democratic representation it is only reasonable to ask what course of action is open to Greeks frustrated to find themselves ignored by their own representatives
While Papademos is indeed correct to observe that vandalism violence and destruction have no place in a democracy what is the proper response when a democracy has ceased to function
The elections scheduled for April offer some measure of hope and it is to be anticipated that significant change in the composition of the Greek parliament will result
But given the pace at which Greece economic fortunes are deteriorating April might seem to be too late
If Papademos and his parliamentary colleagues do not wake up to their responsibilities as representatives they might just find that the Greek people may see fit to take matters into their own hands before going to the polls
While civil unrest in unequivocally to be deplored unless something is done to arrest the crisis of democracy engulfing Greece political system one could perhaps sympathise with protestors taking more affirmative action to restore effective representation
Should the popular will not be given priority over the troika demands Sunday clashes could be just a taste of things to come
A Crisis of Trust
LONDON  Public trust in financial institutions and in the authorities that are supposed to regulate them was an early casualty of the financial crisis
That is hardly surprising as previously revered firms revealed that they did not fully understand the very instruments they dealt in or the risks they assumed
It is difficult not to take some private pleasure in this comeuppance for the Masters of the Universe
But unfortunately if this loss of trust persists it could be costly for us all
As Ralph Waldo Emerson remarked ur distrust is very expensive
The Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow made the point in economic terms almost  years ago t can be plausibly argued that much of the economic backwardness in the world can be explained by the lack of mutual confidence
Indeed much economic research has demonstrated a powerful relationship between the level of trust in a community and its aggregate economic performance
Without mutual trust economic activity is severely constrained
Even within Europe there is powerful evidence that countries where mutual trust is higher achieve higher levels of investment particularly through venture capital investment and are prepared to use more flexible contracts which are also beneficial for growth and investment
So if it is true that trust in financial institutions  and in the governments that oversee them  has been damaged by the crisis we should care a lot and we should be devising responses which seek to rebuild that trust
In fact the evidence for a crisis of trust is rather difficult to interpret
In the United Kingdom recent survey results are ambiguous
Surveys promoted by financial firms tend to show that trust in them has not diminished much and that people continue to trust them even more than they do the National Health Service or the BBC
Surveys promoted by the BBC tend to show the reverse
Banks quote statistics to show that they are more trusted than supermarkets whereas supermarkets cite evidence that the opposite is true and are expanding into financial services in the belief that the public will trust them more than they trust the banks which have had to be expensively bailed out by the government
The market will prove one side right before too long
In the United States there is now a more systematic independent survey promoted by economists at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business
Their financial trust index based on a largescale survey of financial decisionmakers in American households did show a sharp fall in trust in late  and early  following the collapse of Lehman Brothers
That fall in confidence affected banks the stock market and the government and its regulators
Furthermore the survey showed that declining trust was strongly correlated with financial behavior
In other words if your trust in the market and in the way it is regulated fell sharply you were less likely to deposit money in banks or invest in stocks
So falling trust had real economic consequences
Fortunately the latest survey published in July this year shows that trust in banks and bankers has begun to recover and quite sharply
This has been positive for the stock market
There is also a little more confidence in the government response and in financial regulation than there was at the end of last year
The latter point which no doubt reflects the Obama administration attempts to reform the dysfunctional system it inherited is particularly important as the sharpest declines in investment intentions were among those who had lost confidence in the government ability to regulate
It would seem that rebuilding confidence in the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission is economically more important than rebuilding trust in Citibank or AIG
Continuing disputes in Congress about the precise details of reform could therefore have an economic cost if a perception that the system will not be overhauled gains ground
All these data are at an aggregate level and reflect average views among voters and investors
Yet we also know that individual views are remarkably heterogeneous
Some people are very trusting of others and of the firms and institutions with which they do business
Others are congenitally distrustful
Researchers at the European University Institute in Florence and UCLA recently demonstrated that there is a relationship between trust and individuals income
A panEuropean opinion survey which has been carried out for many years allows us to relate the two
It asks simple but powerful questions about how far individuals are inclined to trust those with whom they deal
The data show intriguingly that those who show levels of trust well below the average for the country they live in are likely to have lower incomes
Is that just because lowincome people feel that life is unfair and therefore distrust those around them
It would seem not as it is also true that very trusting people also have lower incomes than the average
In other words if you diverge markedly from society average level of trust you are likely to lose out either because you are so distrustful of others that you miss out on opportunities for investment and mutually beneficial exchange or because you are so trusting that you leave yourself open to being cheated and abused
When anyone I don know says rust me  an irritating conversational tic  I usually close my wallet
Perhaps most academics who are at the lower end of the skill and qualificationadjusted income scale do the same
Maybe we should trust each other more  but not too much
A Crisis of Understanding
NEW HAVEN  Few economists predicted the current economic crisis and there is little agreement among them about its ultimate causes
So not surprisingly economists are not in a good position to forecast how quickly it will end either
Of course we all know the proximate causes of an economic crisis people are not spending because their incomes have fallen their jobs are insecure or both
But we can take it a step further back people income is lower and their jobs are insecure because they were not spending a short time ago  and so on backwards in time in a repeating feedback loop
It is a vicious circle but where and why did it start
Why did it worsen
What will reverse it
It is to these questions that economists have been unable to offer clear answers
The state of economic knowledge was just as bad in the Great Depression that followed the  stock market crash
Economists did not predict that event either
In the  some warned about an overpriced stock market but they did not predict a decadelong depression affecting the entire economy
Late in the Great Depression in August  an article by Ralph M Blagden in
The causes given were istributed widely among government labor industry international politics and policies
They included misguided government interference with markets high income and capital gains taxes mistaken monetary policy pressures towards high wages monopoly overstocked inventories uncertainty caused by the reorganization plan for the Supreme Court rearmament in Europe and fear of war government encouragement of labor disputes a savings glut because of population shrinkage the passing of the frontier and easy credit before the depression
Although economic theory today is much improved if we ask people about the cause of the current crisis we will mostly get the same answers
We would certainly hear some new ones too unprecedented realestate bubbles a global savings glut international trade imbalances exotic financial contracts subprime mortgages unregulated overthecounter markets rating agencies errors compromised realestate appraisals and complacency about counterparty risk
More likely than not many or most of these people would be mostly or partly right for the economic crisis was caused by a confluence of many factors the chance cooccurrence of a lot of bad things which pushed the financial system beyond its breaking point
At that point the trouble grabbed widespread attention destroyed public confidence and set in motion a negative feedback loop
Our attention after all is naturally drawn to the worst events
Consider the question of predicting events like the January  earthquake in Haiti which killed more than  people
It captured our attention because it was so bad in terms of lives and property damage
But if one went beyond trying to predict the occurrence of earthquakes to predicting the extent of the damage one could surely devise a long list of contributing factors  including even political financial and insurance factors  that resembles the list of factors that caused the global economic crisis
Indeed the crisis knows no end to the list of its causes
For in a complicated economic system that feeds back on itself in many ways events that start a vicious cycle might be as seemingly trivial as the proverbial butterfly in the Amazon which by flapping its wings sets off a chain of events that eventually results in a faraway hurricane
Chaos theory in mathematics explains such dependency on remote and seemingly trivial initial conditions and explains why even the extrapolation of apparently precise planetary motion becomes impossible when taken far enough into the future
Weather forecasters cannot forecast far into the future either but at least they have precise mathematical models
Massive parallel computers are programmed to yield numerical solutions of differential equations derived from the theory of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics nbsp Scientists appear to know the mechanism that generates weather even if it is inherently difficult to extrapolate very far
The problem for macroeconomics is that the types of causes mentioned for the current crisis are difficult to systematize
The mathematical models that macroeconomists have may resemble weather models in some respects but their structural integrity is not guaranteed by anything like a solid immutable theory
The most important new book about the origins of the economic crisis Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff
This leaves us trying to use patterns from past dissimilar crises to try to infer the likely prognosis for the current crisis
As a result we simply do not know if the recovery will be solid or disappointing
A Cure for Fiscal Failure
CAMBRIDGE  Should more countries create independent fiscal advisory councils to infuse greater objectivity into national budget debates
Jailed swindler Bernie Madoff recently summed up a lot of people feelings about fiscal policy declaring that he whole government is a Ponzi scheme
Perhaps this was just wishful thinking from a man who will die in prison after his own recordbreaking  billion pyramid scheme collapsed in 
Personally I suspect Madoff unenviable place in the record books will be secure for quite a while
Still with many of the world largest governments facing a lethal combination of unsustainable conventional debt unprecedented oldage pension obligations and a downshift in growth one has to wonder what the fiscal plan is
In a new paper  Decade of Debt Carmen M Reinhart and I show that general government debt in the United States including federal state and local debt has now surpassed the record  of GDP reached at the end of World War II
Japan of course is in even worse shape with government debt totaling more than  of GDP
Though this is partially offset by foreignexchange reserves Japan now faces massive disasterrelief costs  and this on top of its depressing demographic trends
Many other rich countries debt levels are also uncomfortably close to year highs despite relative peace in much of the world
There is a no easy way out
For now low world interest rates are restraining debtservice costs but debt levels can be reduced only very gradually over long periods whereas real inflationadjusted interest rates can rise far more quickly even for rich countries
Debt crises tend to come out of the blue hitting countries whose debt trajectories simply have no room for error or unplanned adversity
The single most immediate and direct impact of having an independent fiscal policy would be to reign in spending by producing a counterpoint to Panglossian government growth and revenue forecasts
In principle an independent and respected advisory council could also force governments to acknowledge the hidden costs of government guarantees and offbalance sheet debts
It is high time to consider novel approaches
Of course no one simple change will eliminate the huge bias towards deficit spending in most modern political systems
And no one simple change will preclude the risk of future debt and inflation crises
Many countries require sweeping reforms to make their tax systems more efficient and their entitlement programs  including their pension schemes  more realistic
The recent advent of fiscal advisory councils is a promising institutional start
A number of countries including Denmark the Netherlands the US and Belgium have longstanding fiscal watchdog agencies such as the US Congressional Budget Office CBO
But while these older institutions have proven enormously useful they are typically quite constrained
The CBO for example is free to issue longterm fiscal projections based on its own best estimates of growth but is largely forced to accept politically implausible future ixes at face value somewhat neutralizing the potential effectiveness of any critique of deficit policies
To enhance credibility a number of governments are gingerly moving towards creating fiscal councils with greater independence often with central banks as a role model
The new vanguard includes councils in Sweden the United Kingdom Slovenia and Canada
The remit of Sweden fiscal council is particularly broad giving it a mandate not only to forecast but also to look more deeply at the motivations and consequences of government policy
In principle an independent fiscal council could have provided invaluable help during the financial crisis
In the US such an agency could have weighed in on the costs and benefits of bailout plans perhaps helping to end congressional paralysis and steeling nerves to give taxpayers more upside risk
It is too much to expect that these new fiscal institutions will become as important or powerful as central banks at least anytime soon
There is far more consensus over monetary policy than over fiscal policy
And fiscal policy is far more complex and multidimensional
Still the general principle seems like an important step towards fiscal sanity
Of course fiscal councils by themselves are not enough no matter how well designed they are
It will remain very tempting for each generation to say y grandchildren will be two or three times richer than I so who cares if they have to pay some debt
Moreover the political cycle creates a very strong deficit bias as leaders seek to embellish feelings of economic health and prosperity by raising visible expenditures at the cost of hidden debts and lower longterm investment
To resist these powerful pressures fiscal councils will need to have their work audited periodically by international agencies such as the International Monetary Fund both to protect their independence and to promote accountability
To be sure Bernie Madoff may yet be proved right and his will not turn out to be the biggest Ponzi scheme ever
But greater transparency and a more systematic independent evaluation of government policies could be a very helpful step towards solving the perpetual conundrum of outsized deficits
It is certainly one of the more innovative and promising ideas to emerge from a rather barren policy landscape
All Quiet on the Currency Front
CAMBRIDGE  The term urrency wars is a catchy way of saying ompetitive devaluation
In the wake of the sharp fall in the value of the yen over the last six months owing to the monetary component of Japan efforts to jumpstart its economy the issue is expected to feature prominently on the agenda at the G upcoming summit in Northern Ireland
But should it
According to the International Monetary Fund competitive devaluation occurs when countries are anipulating exchange rateso gain an unfair competitive advantage over other members But a key point is often missed when the term urrency wars has been applied to monetary expansion by the Federal Reserve the Bank of Japan and other central banks in recent years
The impact of monetary stimulus on a country trade balance  and hence on demand for trading partners goods  is ambiguous the expenditureswitching effect when the exchange rate responds is counteracted by the expenditureincreasing effect of expansion
Restored income growth means more imports from other countries
urrency wars is a more apt description when countries intervene to push down their currencies in deliberate attempts to help their trade balances
But national authorities will and should pursue economic policies that are primarily in their own countries interests
International cooperation can be fruitful but there is little point attempting it if the nature of the spillover effects is not relatively clear to all
Everyone agrees for example that spillovers from pollution or tariffs are negative not positive externalities
But the case is not as obvious in the case of monetary policy
For example if unemployment is high and inflation low in the United States the Fed will naturally ease monetary policy particularly via low interest rates
If Brazil is in danger of overheating its central bank will naturally tighten policy particularly via high interest rates
It is also natural that capital will flow from north to south as a result causing the Brazilian real to appreciate against the dollar
That is the beauty of floating exchange rates both countries can choose their own appropriate policies
Given that the two countries are in different cyclical positions such exchangerate movements signal that the international economic system is working properly
Although the stronger real will help US exporters other things being equal and hurt those in Brazil such asualties of war are not even collateral damage rather they are precisely the point
If the goal is to stimulate demand for US goods and dampen demand for Brazilian goods why shouldn exporters in both countries share in that process alongside construction and other sectors that are sensitive to interest rates via domestic demand
A more serious dilemma arises if one of the countries is targeting or even fixing the exchange rate as many Latin American governments did to kill off high inflation in the late  and early 
Such a country will not necessarily want to abandon a proven exchangerate regime at the first sign of trouble
Capital controls and sterilization of reserve flows might help to delay the adjustment but a persistent onedirectional capital flow will eventually force the fixedexchangerate country to allow either its exchange rate or its money supply to adjust
True in recent years a wide array of countries has indicated a preference for weaker currencies as a means of improving their trade balances
It is also true by definition that not everyone can depreciate or improve their trade balance at the same time
But that does not necessarily mean that depreciators are guilty of violating any agreements or norms especially if they have merely maintained a preexisting exchangerate regime
Uncoordinated monetary expansion does not even necessarily leave the world in a worse equilibrium
Barry Eichengreen and Jeffrey Sachs have persuasively argued this for the  the opposite of the conventional wisdom regarding beggarthyneighbor competitive devaluations
Although all countries could not improve their trade balances simultaneously when they devalued against gold they succeeded in raising the price of gold thereby increasing the real value of the global money supply  exactly what a world in depression needed
The same applies today
Brazil finance minister Guido Mantega coined the term urrency wars in response to American efforts to enlist Brazil and other competitors of China in a campaign for a stronger renminbi
But the accusation against the US is especially misplaced
US monetary expansion contributed to global monetary expansion at a time when on average it was needed
US authorities have not intervened in the foreignexchange market or talked down the dollar and currency depreciation was not the Fed goal when deciding to implement its quantitativeeasing policy
Japan comes a little closer to qualifying as a currency warrior because members of Shinzo Abe government were initially foolish enough to mention yen depreciation as an explicit goal
China qualifies in one important respect the renminbi was substantially undervalued by most measures from  to  less so now
But countries have a right to opt for fixed exchange rates
Continuing an existing regime as China was doing does not sound very much like anipulation
True renminbi appreciation was probably in China interest
It would have been reasonable beginning in  for those worried about currentaccount imbalances to propose that China voluntarily allow some appreciation in exchange for say the US putting its fiscal house in order
But this is different from accusing Beijing of violating international norms or rules and threatening retaliation for example by imposing tariffs which is a violation of international rules
Few countries accused of participating in a currency war have undertaken discrete devaluations in recent years or acted to weaken their currencies by switching their exchangerate regimes
These are the sorts of deliberate policy changes connoted by a term like anipulation
Switzerland perhaps comes the closest
But the franc was so strong even at the new rate set in September  that no one can accuse the Swiss National Bank of unfair undervaluation
The world has enough serious disputes as it is
We do not need to invent new ones
Read an extended version of this argument in Jeffrey Frankel blog post ispatches from the Currency Wars
A Customs Union for the Balkans
The fall of Milosevic does not cure the political woes of the Balkans indeed it raises their urgency
Yugoslavia has disintegrated but the disintegration is incomplete
It was in Yugoslavia that Vojislav Kostunica was elected president but his mandate comes solely from support in Serbia
Montenegro Serbia junior partner in the Yugoslav federation mostly boycotted the election while Albanians in Kosovo ignored them
Yet it was Yugoslavia whose foundations are unstable that was recently admitted to the UN
A host of problems remain unresolved relations between Serbia and Montenegro and the status of Kosovo not to mention Serbia northern province of Vojvodina
Any resolution  any suggestion of change  will engender new conflicts because of conflicting claims of sovereignty
However tempting it may be to solve the puzzle by drawing new borders or establishing new entities this conundrum cannot be resolved in terms of sovereignty
That traditional solution would only perpetuate the problems of the Balkans
A new approach is needed the European Union should use the prospect of European integration as the way to promote regional integration
The EU could act as a magnet to bring the region closer together by bringing the region as a whole closer to Europe
This idea has great appeal to people in the region but only the EU can make it happen
After NATO intervention in Kosovo European leaders made this approach the cornerstone of their vision for the Balkans
It was enshrined in the Stability Pact signed at the Sarajevo Summit of July 
But the Stability Pact is merely a shell  it needs to be filled with content
The time to do so is at the Zagreb Conference on November  called by France as the current EU president
The European Union should now propose a threepoint plan for the Balkans
 a customs union with preferential access to EU markets within one year
The existing EUTurkey customs union should be used as a model
Once all these countries reach agreement with the EU there would automatically be free trade throughout the Balkans
This will take some time to implement
But from the start the EU should give a signal by unilaterally opening its border to imports from the region
This cannot endanger any EU interests as the countries at issue now have far less than  of the EU market
 a regional VAT to replace the lost customs revenues should be established within two years
Differences in indirect taxes such as VAT pose another way in which borders become obstacles to trade
They should be unified throughout the region
Regional VAT rates might be increased slightly if expenditure restraint is not sufficient to offset the loss of tariff revenues due to the customs union
 Temporary budgetary support on a declining scale for three years subject to EU supervision over budgetary expenditures
Because it will take time to collect revenues from the regional VAT the EU should provide financial help during the transition
The area covered by this plan would include Bulgaria Croatia and Albania as well as Serbia Bosnia Macedonia Montenegro and Kosovo
Participation by Romania and Moldova is optional
Bulgaria and Croatia could be persuaded to participate provided it would not interfere with their candidacy for EU membership
Depending on the country there could be more or less budgetary support
Bulgaria for example might not need compensation since to a great extent it has already eliminated tariffs
In comparison to the cost of military intervention and peacekeeping the financial costs here are ridiculously low
I estimate that Euro  million in the first year Euro  million in the second year and Euro  million in the third year would do the trick
If Romania and Moldova were included the figures would be slightly higher
These figures are well within range of pledges already made by the EU for the Stability Pact and they could be easily accommodated within the confines of the Berlin Accord on the EU budget for  if EU member states agree to a reallocation of unspent funds
Budgetary support in the context of a Customs Union would be a more effective way to disburse EU funds than conventional methods
This threepoint program would lay the ground for economic resurgence
It would remove two major sources of corruption and inefficiency the customs service and the misuse of public funds in general
It would create a trade area large enough to generate both local and foreign investment
The Deutsche Mark already widely used in the region now functions as the de facto common currency
Any ban on its use should be lifted to make borders irrelevant for trade and investment
Improved economic prospects and the strengthening of institutions in turn would have a positive impact on the political climate throughout the Balkans
Serbia has climbed part of the way out of the abyss
Success in peacefully removing a tyrant has set in motion a process of national renewal
But that process has a long way to go
The opposition inherited a bankrupt country whose institutions are in ruins
The population frustrated by ever deepening impoverishment and isolation is beginning to question what happened over the past decade in Serbia
People are asking about crimes committed by the Milosevic regime against Serbs
They must begin to come to terms with the crimes committed against others  in Croatia Bosnia and Kosovo
Once that process is underway many problems that now seem intractable will be resolved more easily
Kostunica election as President of Yugoslavia amounts to an incomplete revolution many of the old guard are still in place
The momentum created by Milosevic overthrow needs to be maintained
Milosevic was overthrown in the hope of ending Serbia isolation
Europe must now fulfill its promise
If the French Presidency fails to seize the moment in Zagreb an historic opportunity will be lost
A Czech Moment
PRAGUE  As I listened to what some Europeans were saying as my country prepared to take over the presidency of the European Union I heard dim echoes of Neville Chamberlain infamous description of Czechoslovakia as  faraway country of which we know little
I suppose that Donald Rumsfeld misguided bid a few years ago to incite a divide between ew and old Europe contributed to the reemergence of that disdainful attitude
The reality is that there is no such thing as ld and new Europe and there never was
The break with communism and reunification of Europe is now almost two decades old
We Czechs are  European and were even when the Iron Curtain cut us off from democratic Europe
Indeed our proEU sentiments may be all the stronger because our membership in the Union like our freedom is so comparatively new
So no one in Europe needs to fear that the Czech Republic has some nostalgic or idiosyncratic agenda that it wants to impose on the Union
On the contrary events have imposed an agenda on Europe that we cannot escape and for which solidarity  true union  will be needed
The primary and most pressing of the problems we face is the financial and economic crisis that is enveloping the EU
Unfortunately conditions across the Union will likely worsen before they begin to improve
The type of social unrest recently witnessed in Greece may spread because the downturn is likely to take a disproportionate toll on Europe young people who are seeking jobs at a time when hardpressed European businesses will be able to offer them very few
It will fall to the Union once again to help transform despair into hope
We Czechs know something about this as the wrenching economic transition that we underwent in the  taught us much about how the right policies can break the grip of hopelessness
To contain today financial and economic crisis Europe will also need to continue the cooperation that it has shown up to this point
The very existence of our Union and particularly of the euro has already helped to prevent the competitive devaluations and beggarthyneighbor policies that ravaged Europe during the   the last time the continent faced so brutal an economic downturn
But we cannot be complacent that the forces of national egoism will remain in check
For now EU governments coordinated fiscal stimulus has deprived populists of their usual charge that the EU is indifferent to the fate of individuals
Even more policy coordination will be needed both to confront the crisis and to reestablish EU norms once the storm clouds begin to dissipate
Although it is right that the Stability and Growth Pact has become more flexible in these extraordinary times its rules did secure a successful first decade for the euro
These rules must eventually be restored intact if Europe is to return to the path of sustainable growth and a consensus will need to be forged now to make that happen
The second key challenge that we will face during our European presidency is that of Russia
A new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement PCA between the EU and the Russian Federation must be negotiated
Those negotiations should have begun seriously last year but the war in Georgia intervened to put them on hold
Now those talks have resumed but the background to the negotiations has changed dramatically
Russia economy is now in far worse shape than that of EU members
The collapse of world oil and gas prices has wounded Russia budget and lack of investment in the country energy sector over the years is now causing the declining production that economists have long predicted
Until now Russia has cared less about a new PCA than the EU because twothirds of Russia exports to the Union comprise natural resources which bring in cash even without the strong rules that a PCA provides
Given the stark changes in economic conditions however it is now in Russia national interest to reassure international markets that it is a reliable place to do business for which a new PCA would serve as an ideal signal
Moreover without a new PCA individual European countries may feel it necessary to seek even more bilateral agreements with Russia
Indeed many EU members have been in a race with each other to see who will be Russia closest friend in the Union
But the bilateral deals that have emerged from this race sometimes come at the expense of other Union members and may unbalance relations within the Union as a whole Only a rulesbased EU framework can provide a firm foundation for both bilateral and Unionwide relations with Russia
Europe main strength in foreign policy is not its commitment to a rulesbased multilateralism important as that undoubtedly is but its unity
When the Georgia crisis erupted Europe united around a single position on Russia withdrawal
It is the Czech Republic task and that of the Swedish EU presidency that will follow our own to maintain this unity as the PCA negotiations move forward
During the  the US and Europe erred in treating Russia with benign neglect It would be a mistake for Russia to respond in kind today by seeking to prolong the PCA negotiations in the hope that a possibly more amenable EU president may one day offer softer terms
We like all EU presidencies will be representing the wider Union interests when we negotiate
Protectionist Shadows over Solar Power
CAMBRIDGE  As July ended a settlement was reached in the world largest antidumping dispute with China agreeing to a minimum price for the solar panels that it exports to the European Union
The solution is much less severe than what had been the imminent alternative EU tariffs on Chinese solar panels were set to rise to  as a result of the European Commission inding that China  whose market share now stands at  in Europe  had been umping
Nonetheless the settlement is a bad outcome for consumers and for the environment
The ChinaEU dispute parallels a similar one between China and the United States
Last fall the US introduced tariffs of  against Chinese solarpanel imports after the Commerce Department determined that China had been umping  which is generally defined as selling at a price below cost  into the American market
China citing its own finding of US dumping of polysilicon  a key input in the production of solar panels  into its market has already retaliated by imposing import tariffs that could exceed 
The solarpanel disputes may sound narrow and esoteric but they go to the heart of the longrunning debate over globalization
Antiglobalization activists most powerful argument is that even if free trade is good for economic progress overall it might undermine important public goods such as environmental protection
Under the wellknown ace to the bottom hypothesis countries that are open to international trade are thought to adopt weaker environmental regulations than less open countries do
But trade can also have beneficial environmental effects
Specialization in each country allows people to obtain more of what they want which especially at higher income levels includes cleaner air and water
When trade brings down costs it can benefit environmental goods just as much as it benefits other goods
So is trade globalization on balance better or worse for the environment
Some empirical studies of crosscountry data find net beneficial effects on indicators of environmental degradation like local sulfurdioxide air pollution
Provided that countries have effective governance institutions at the national level trade and growth give them the means to clean their air
But the evidence also suggests that trade and growth can exacerbate other forms of environmental degradation particularly carbondioxide emissions because CO is a global externality that cannot be addressed at the national level owing to the freerider problem
The solarpower industry is a perfect example of how trade can benefit air quality
Skeptics of solar power have long argued that its share in electricity generation cannot rise above a few percentage points without massive subsidies because it is too costly compared to the alternatives
Proponents for their part counter that temporary moderate subsidies would expand the industry with economies of scale and learningbydoing then bringing down costs sharply
But proponents have focused too much on government subsidies and too little on the contribution of international trade which in recent years has had a highly positive effect on the development of solar power as the bonanza of Chinese panels held down costs
The current embrace of protectionism threatens to reverse this progress
With the loss of cheap solar panels from China and with subsidies that helped to drive the European industry now reduced for fiscal reasons the share of solar power in Europe will fall far short of environmentalists goals
But indings of umping into foreign markets surely warrant some response no
Actually no
For starters even those who are generally sympathetic to trade and markets often have the impression that antidumping laws target redatory pricing a practice in which a large producer sells below cost in order to drive its competitors into bankruptcy at which point it can raise the price and reap monopoly profits
But that is not even the way antidumping laws are usually written let alone applied
Simply put antidumping measures such as the US and EU tariffs against Chinese solar panels are a means of reducing not fostering competition
So if predatory pricing is not the producers motive for selling below cost in these cases what is
The solarpanel industry worldwide  in China Europe and the US  is experiencing a glut of productive capacity
As a result global supply and demand are balanced at a market price that is below the longterm average cost per unit which includes a share of the cost already incurred in building the factories
But that market price is not below the shortterm cost of keeping the factories running once they are built
In other words producers sell at prices that are elow cost because having already built the factories they would lose even more money if they charged above the competitive market price or shut down production altogether
When the US or EU finds that China is umping solar panels or when China finds that the US is umping polysilicon they are using average cost rather than marginal cost
By this criterion dumping occurs every time a store has a clearance sale
Some have compared the negotiated agreements to limit China solarpanel exports to past oluntary export restraints VERs or rderly marketing arrangements in the steel and consumerelectronic industries especially those that Japan agreed to apply to its exports to the US in the 
But a more revealing precedent is Japan VERs on exports of autos during this period
American automakers had found it increasingly difficult to compete against smaller more fuelefficient Japanese imports
When free trade was eventually restored American wallets and air quality benefited and the US auto industry was forced to become more efficient
Free trade in automobiles was good for the environment  years ago
The same is true of trade in solar equipment today
Westerners should thank Chinese panel producers for their contribution to keeping solar power viable not penalize them through protectionist antidumping measures

Focal Point
A Daughter of Dictatorship and Democracy
SEOUL  It is something of a clich question in South Korea nowadays Who would be the country next president if the election were held tomorrow rather than in December 
Numerous opinion polls show Park Geunhye of the ruling Grand National Party GNP to be the leading candidate
If elected she would be South Korea first woman president and for her rivals her dominant position in the race is an uncomfortable but unassailable fact
South Korean voters of all ages and regions have welcomed Park as a candidate for their country leadership
Her political style is both refreshing and relevant because she comes across as sincere and forthright at a time when the public is hungry for moral leadership
And she has an astonishing talent for simplifying complicated issues accurately which she likely learned  along with how to interpret and manipulate the political connotations of every issue  from her father former President Park Chunghee
Acclaimed as a national hero among radical rightwingers the ironfisted Park Chunghee ruled South Korea from  to  in the wake of the  military coup only to be assassinated by his intelligence chief
His daughter is proud of his legacy which marked the beginning of South Korea economic boom
Indeed as a pillar of exportoriented modernity Park Chunghee was once lionized as the archetype of a modernizing political leadership in militaryauthoritarian states
At home he still ranks first in popularity among the country heads of state kindling nostalgia like a popular old record  a corollary to people frustration and anger at the current government of President Lee Myungbak
Park who lost her first bid for the GNP nomination to Lee in  needs to ensure that no rupture with her erstwhile rival knocks her off the path to victory in 
An astute politician Park did not hesitate to campaign wholeheartedly for Lee the last time around  a move that as part of longterm political strategy made perfect sense
To many South Koreans the election is now Park to lose
No candidate on the horizon seems able to stop her
If she wins it will be the result of her seriousness and tenacity not her political heritage
No one in South Korea conservative movement doubts that Park is one of them
And as an icon of the right she is well aware that she cannot afford to betray her status
Despite her charisma Park is neither a Sarah Palin nor an Eva Peron
Indeed she looks more like a Korean Margaret Thatcher  a lady not for turning in Thatcher famous phrase and with clearly thoughtthrough political principles animating her actions
In any case she seems destined to establish a new South Korea focusing on her landmark pledge ul pu se literally meaning educeloosenstrengthen taxcuts deregulation and law and order not just to add another chapter to her father old book
Her administration would mark a fresh departure from the country troubled recent past
Leftleaning pundits claim that the dictator daughter has the same autocratic vision as her father though Park invariably prefers incremental change to radical measures and cut her political teeth in the toughminded politics of the GNP
Others take a flagrantly sexist stance arguing that a woman president would be a nonstarter as long as the North Korean regime continues to threaten national security
Although these criticisms don seem to bother the electorate very much Park path to victory may yet prove narrower than her supporters expect
She has been called the ueen of Elections in particular since she won a campaign in  after being slashed with a box cutter by a deranged man
But she must convincingly outline practical strategies to resolve South Korea most serious problems including high unemployment worsening educational performance and North Korea nuclear weapons program
Ms Park once pledged to provide loans for workingclass families from elementary school to college years while contending that local universities should be empowered to have more autonomy
She favors engagement policy and the sixparty talks so as to resolve the nuclear troubles
Come presidential electionday in  South Korean voters will pick the candidate who embodies pragmatism and centrism over a partisan or ideologue
Park success will depend in the end on the effectiveness of her campaign in further defining her character along those lines
Unlike former Peruvian dictator Alberto Fujimori daughter who lost her presidential bid in Peru last month Park is likely to defy her family tragic history
If she does she will be Asia most powerful woman perhaps the most powerful in the world at the end of next year
A Day for Planetary Justice
PRINCETON  What we are doing to our planet to our children and grandchildren and to the poor by our heedless production of greenhouse gases is one of the great moral wrongs of our age
On October  you can stand up against this injustice
October  is  Day
The name comes from the number of parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that according to Jim Hansen perhaps the world leading climate scientist we should not exceed if we are to avoid potentially catastrophic climate change
It is a measure of the seriousness of our problem that CO is already at  ppm and is rising by two ppm each year
The need to cut greenhouse gases has become increasingly clear as predictions of global warming  denounced as larmist when they were first made just a few years ago  have repeatedly turned out to have been too conservative
We are approaching a point of no return at which feedback loops will kick in and continue to warm the planet no matter what we do
The melting of arctic ice is one example
Four hundred years ago explorers sought the legendary ortheast Passage across the north of Europe and Russia to China
They found the arctic ice impenetrable and soon gave up their quest
This year commercial vessels successfully navigated the Northeast Passage
That is one of many recent dramatic signs that our climate is changing and that our planet is warmer than it has been for a very long time
But icefree arctic waters are more than a symptom of global warming
They are themselves a cause of further warming ice and snow reflect the sun rays
An icefree surface absorbs more warmth from the sun than one covered in snow or ice In other words our greenhouse gas emissions have by causing enough warming to melt the arctic ice created a feedback loop that will generate more warming and melt more ice even if we were to stop emitting all greenhouse gases tomorrow
Other feedback loops pose a similar danger
In Siberia vast quantities of methane an extremely potent greenhouse gas are locked up in what used to be called ermafrost  regions in which it was assumed that the ground was permanently frozen
But areas that used to be frozen are now thawing releasing methane and thus contributing to further warming  and to further thawing which releases more methane
Developing nations are grasping just how outrageous the current distribution of greenhousegas emissions really is
At the United Nations Summit on Climate Change in September President Paul Kagame of Rwanda pointed out that while developed nations outside Africa are almost entirely responsible for the problem its greatest impact will probably be on Africa which has few resources to cope with the challenge
Kagame then suggested giving every country an annual per capita quota for CO emissions and allowing developing countries that are below the quota to trade their excess quota with countries that are above theirs
The money that developing countries would receive for this would not be aid but rather a recognition that the rich nations must pay for something that in the past they simply appropriated far more than their fair share of our atmosphere capacity to absorb our waste gases
Sri Lanka took a similar stance using studies from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to calculate that in  environmentally permissible carbon emissions totaled no more than  kilograms per person
In fact the world per capita emissions were  kilograms or more than double the permissible limit
But while emissions in the rich nations were far above the permissible limit Sri Lankan emissions were at  kilograms well below it
As Sri Lanka government pointed out hat means lowemitting countries like us could not emit more because our space has already been exploited by developed or global heavy polluting countries without our consent
This situation is an injustice of vast proportions reminiscent of  and arguably much worse than  the nowrepudiated colonialism of the Western powers in the nineteenth century
The task of remedying it must begin at the meeting on climate change that will be held in Copenhagen in December
Many political leaders have expressed support for strong action on climate change but what most of them regard as trong action will not be enough to get us back below  ppm
In some countries including the United States there are major political obstacles to taking even modest steps
On October  people in nearly every country will be taking action to raise awareness of the need for an international treaty to bring our atmosphere back to  ppm of CO
There will be climbers hanging banners high in the Himalayas where the glaciers are melting and scuba divers at Australia Great Barrier Reef which is threatened by climate change
Churches will ring bells  times  cyclists will circle towns and in many places  trees will be planted

A Day of Liberation
When I was seven years old in  my grandmother Angelica opened my eyes to the meaning of  May  the day when Nazi Germany surrendered and World War II ended in Europe
We were spending our summer holidays in Normandy where the liberation of Europe from Nazism had started on DDay  June 
One evening I listened to my parents and my grandmother talking about the past
I have forgotten the details of their conversation but I can still hear my grandmother sigh of relief when she said hank God we lost that war
From a child perspective it wasn selfevident that losing was a good thing
But of course my grandmother was right to equate defeat with liberation
The more I have thought about the lesson she taught me  years ago the clearer I have seen another less obvious dimension in what she said It is e who lost the war
Collectively the Germans had not been the innocent victims of a small gang of criminal outsiders called azis  Nazism had been an inside ideology supported by millions of Germans and every German was liable for its atrocities whether or not he or she had adhered to it individually
In today Germany an overwhelming majority subscribes to the proposition that  May  was a day of liberation  not only for Europe but also for Germany itself
Compared to public opinion in  that certainly an enormous progress
But paradoxically it may also contain an element of forgetfulness because it tends to conceal the fact that liberation required a military defeat
To use my grandmother parlance it is not s who were the liberators but hem
The way people see the past tells us more about their present attitudes than about the past itself
This is what the term olitics of memory is meant to indicate
And this is why it doesn matter whether the relevant events happened  years ago as World War II  years as in the case of the Armenian genocide or even  years such as the battle of Kosovo in 
A violent conflict in the past may survive as a war of memories in the present as can be observed in the current dispute between China and South Korea on one side and Japan on the other
A war of memories in turn may sometimes lead to a violent conflict in the future
Former perpetrators often try to delegitimize their former victims moral superiority by claiming they were victims themselves
Therefore the th anniversary of the firebombing of Dresden by Allied forces on  February  has probably been a more crucial moment in terms of the German olitics of memory than the th anniversary of  May  is going to be
Farright groups infamously dubbed the attack by which at least  people were killed resden Holocaust of bombs
Fortunately their propaganda campaign has been a failure
Although it is true that thousands of the civilians killed in Dresden and other German cities were innocent at an individual level there can be no doubt it was morally imperative that Germany be defeated collectively
On the left side of the German political spectrum the proposition that  May  was a day of liberation remains unchallenged
However it is sometimes repressed that the massive use of force had been necessary to achieve that result
Leftwing pacifism tends to overlook this simple fact
Its slogan ever again war is only half the truth  the other half is ever again appeasement  May  was not ero hour as a popular saying in Germany goes
It had an antecedent that is a lack of preemptive resistance at home and abroad to the threat that built up in Nazi Germany during the 
There is yet another lesson to be learned
Yes  May  was a day of liberation to which the Soviet army contributed decisively
But for millions of Central and East Europeans liberation was followed by Stalin oppressive regime
The current war of memories between the Baltic republics and Russia with regard to the international celebration in Moscow on  May this year reminds Germany of a special historic responsibility
The GermanSoviet nonaggression treaty the socalled HitlerStalin pact concluded in August  had been supplemented by a secret appendix dividing the border states Finland Estonia Latvia Lithuania Poland and Romania into spheres of interest for the two parties
But excusing Nazi atrocities by pointing to Stalinist crimes is an intellectually and morally unacceptable stratagem
When Chancellor Schrder travels to Moscow for the Red Square celebrations he should bear in mind Nazi Germany contribution to the Baltic tragedy
On  May this year public speakers will remind us how important it is not to forget
They will stress that if the lessons of history are not learned history is bound to repeat itself
All this is perfectly true
But personally I will also remember my grandmother sentence hank God we lost that war
Thank God  and thanks to all those brave Allied soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the sake of Europe liberty
A DeGlobalized World
Cambridge  It may take a few months or a couple of years but one way or another the United States and other advanced economies will eventually recover from today crisis
The world economy however is unlikely to look the same
Even with the worst of the crisis over we are likely to find ourselves in a somewhat deglobalized world one in which international trade grows at a slower pace there is less external finance and rich countries appetite for running large currentaccount deficits is significantly diminished
Will this spell doom for developing countries
Not necesarily
Growth in the developing world tends to come in three distinct variants
First comes growth driven by foreign borrowing
Second is growth as a byproduct of commodity booms
Third is growth led by economic restructuring and diversification into new products
The first two models are at greater risk than the third
But we should not lose sleep over them because they are flawed and ultimately unsustainable
What should be of greater concern is the potential plight of countries in the last group
These countries will need to undertake major changes in their policies to adjust to today new realities
The first two growth models invariably come to a bad end
Foreign borrowing can enable consumers and governments to live beyond their means for a while but reliance on foreign capital is an unwise strategy
The problem is not only that foreign capital flows can easily reverse direction but also that they produce the wrong kind of growth based on overvalued currencies and investments in nontraded goods and services such as housing and construction
Growth driven by high commodity prices is also susceptible to busts for similar reasons Commodity prices tend to move in cycles
When they are high they are apt to crowd out investments in manufactures and other nontraditional tradables
Moreover commodity booms frequently produce ugly politics in countries with weak institutions leading to costly struggles for resource rents which are rarely invested wisely
So it is no surprise that the countries that have produced steady longterm growth during the last six decades are those that relied on a different strategy promoting diversification into manufactured and other odern goods
By capturing a growing share of world markets for manufactures and other nonprimary products these countries increased their domestic employment opportunities in highproductivity activities
Their governments pursued not just good undamentals eg macroeconomic stability and an outward orientation but also what might be called roductivist policies undervalued currencies industrial policies and financial controls
China exemplified this approach
Its growth was fueled by an extraordinarily rapid structural transformation towards an increasingly sophisticated set of industrial goods
In recent years China also got hooked on a large trade surplus visvis the US he counterpart of its undervalued currency
But it wasn just China
Countries that had been growing rapidly in the runup to the great crash of  typically had trade surpluses or very small deficits
These countries did not want to be recipients of capital inflows because they realized that this would wreak havoc with their need to maintain competitive currencies
It is now part of conventional wisdom that large external balances ypified by the bilateral USChina trade relationship  played a major contributing role in the great crash
Global macroeconomic stability requires that we avoid such large currentaccount imbalances in the future
But a return to high growth in developing countries requires that they resume their push into tradable goods and services
In the past this push was accommodated by the willingness of the US and a few other developed nations to run large trade deficits
This is no longer a feasible strategy for large or middleincome developing countries
So are the requirements of global macroeconomic stability and of growth for developing countries at odds with each other
Will developing countries need to generate large increases in the supply of industrial products inevitably clash with the world intolerance of trade imbalances
There is in fact no inherent conflict once we understand that what matters for growth in developing countries is not the size of their trade surpluses nor even the volume of their exports
What matters is their output of modern industrial goods and services which can expand without limit as long as domestic demand expands simultaneously
Maintaining an undervalued currency has the upside that it subsidizes the production of such goods but it also has the downside that it taxes domestic consumption  which is why it generates a trade surplus
By encouraging industrial production directly it is possible to have the upside without the downside
There are many ways that this can be done including reducing the cost of domestic inputs and services through targeted investments in infrastructure
Explicit industrial policies can be an even more potent instrument
The key point is that developing countries that are concerned about the competitiveness of their modern sectors can afford to allow their currencies to appreciate in real terms as long as they have access to alternative policies that promote industrial activities more directly
So the good news is that developing countries can continue to grow rapidly even if world trade slows in and there is reduced appetite for capital flows and trade imbalances
Their growth potential need not be severely affected as long as the implications of this new world for domestic and international policies are understood
One such implication is that developing countries will have to substitute real industrial policies for those that operate through the exchange rate
Another is that external policy actors for example the World Trade Organization will have to be more tolerant of these policies as long as the effects on trade balances are neutralized through appropriate adjustments in the real exchange rate
Greater use of industrial policies is the price to be paid for a reduction of macroeconomic imbalances
A Death of One Own
PRINCETON  Dudley Clendinen a writer and journalist has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS a terminal degenerative illness
In The New York Times earlier this year he wrote movingly both of his current enjoyment of his life and of his plan to end it when as he put it he music stops  when I can tie my bow tie tell a funny story walk my dog talk with Whitney kiss someone special or tap out lines like this
A friend told Clendinen that he needed to buy a gun
In the United States you can buy a gun and put a bullet through your brain without breaking any laws
But if you are a lawabiding person who is already too ill to buy a gun or to use one or if shooting yourself doesn strike you as a peaceful and dignified way to end your life or if you just don want to leave a mess for others to clean up what are you to do
You can ask someone else to shoot you and in most countries if you tell your doctor that you have had enough and that you would like his or her assistance in dying you are asking your doctor to commit a crime
Last month an expert panel of the Royal Society of Canada chaired by Udo Schklenk a professor of bioethics at Queens University released a report on decisionmaking at the end of life
The report provides a strong argument for allowing doctors to help their patients to die provided that the patients are competent and freely request such assistance
The ethical basis of the panel argument is not so much the avoidance of unnecessary suffering in terminally ill patients but rather the core value of individual autonomy or selfdetermination
he manner of our dying the panel concludes eflects our sense of what is important just as much as do the other central decisions in our lives
In a state that protects individual rights therefore deciding how to die ought to be recognized as such a right
The report also offers an uptodate review of how assistance by physicians in ending life is working in the iving laboratories  the jurisdictions where it is legal
In Switzerland as well as in the US states of Oregon Washington and Montana the law now permits physicians on request to supply a terminally ill patient with a prescription for a drug that will bring about a peaceful death
In The Netherlands Belgium and Luxembourg doctors have the additional option of responding to the patient request by giving the patient a lethal injection
The panel examined reports from each of these jurisdictions with the exception of Montana where legalization of assistance in dying occurred only in  and reliable data are not yet available
In The Netherlands voluntary euthanasia accounted for  of all deaths in   exactly the same level as in 
Moreover the frequency of ending a patient life without an explicit request from the patient fell by half during the same period from  to 
Indeed several surveys suggest that ending a patient life without an explicit request is much more common in other countries where patients cannot lawfully ask a doctor to end their lives
In Belgium although voluntary euthanasia rose from  of all deaths in  to  in  the frequency of ending a patient life without an explicit request fell from  to 
In Oregon where the Death with Dignity Act has been in effect for  years the annual number of physicianassisted deaths has yet to reach  per year and the annual total in Washington is even lower
The Canadian panel therefore concluded that there is strong evidence to rebut one of the greatest fears that opponents of voluntary euthanasia or physicianassisted dying often voice  that it is the first step down a slippery slope towards more widespread medical killing
The panel also found inadequate several other objections to legalization and recommended that the law in Canada be changed to permit both physicianassisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia
Surveys show that more than twothirds of Canadians support legalization of voluntary euthanasia  a level that has held steady for several decades
So it is not surprising that the report received strong backing in the mainstream Canadian media
What is more puzzling is the cool response from the country political parties none of which indicated a willingness to support law reform in this area
There is a similar contrast between public opinion and political inaction elsewhere including the United Kingdom Australia New Zealand and several continental European countries
Why when it comes to dying do democratic institutions so often fail to translate what people want into legislation
I suspect that above all mainstream politicians fear religious institutions that oppose voluntary euthanasia even though individual believers often do not follow their religious leaders views
Polls in various countries have shown that a majority of Roman Catholics for example support legalization of voluntary euthanasia
Even in strongly Catholic Poland more people now support legalization than oppose it
In any case the religious beliefs of a minority should not deny individuals like Dudley Clendinen the right to end their lives in the manner of their own choosing
A Decade of Hugo Chvez
SAN JOSE  We should have known that something was amiss when during President Hugo Chvez inauguration on February   he swore on Venezuela yearold Constitution by declaring it oribund
Under he moribund as the Constitution came to be known Venezuela not only had eight peaceful presidential transitions but also enjoyed the fruits of democratic pluralism and strong civil and political liberties
Of course during this period Venezuela produced as much corruption and political irresponsibility as it did barrels of oil
Nonetheless Venezuela fared far better than the average Latin American country
It wasn Switzerland but by anyone measure it was a genuine democracy
Not anymore
Elections are still held but the legacy of Chvez decade in power consists first and foremost in the demolition of democratic institutions
Elected in a landslide to clean up the political vices of the previous establishment Chvez chose to throw the baby out with the bathwater
The previous regime including its system of checks and balances and its tradition of political tolerance did disappear but its vices  particularly graft and demagoguery  became worse than ever
Pretty much like  years ago Venezuela once a destination for immigrants from around the world remains underdeveloped
More fundamentally Chvez represents ideas that have long stifled Latin America political and economic growth
This includes the notion that social justice can be achieved only by abandoning the path of reform and rejecting ourgeois democratic forms in favor of eal democracy born of revolutionary purity and the leader millenarian dreams
That simply false
Though the Chvez revolution has made progress against poverty and inequality it is hardly sustainable and reeks of patronage
In fact one can find similar achievements in Chile and Brazil which have not given up on democratic checks and balances political pluralism or freedom of the press and have not enjoyed the luxury of  billion in oil revenue in the space of one decade
Moreover it ought not to be forgotten that between  and  Venezuela itself reduced extreme poverty from  to  of the population one of the lowest figures in Latin America
It did so with democracy and freedom
Chvez also repeats
It is obvious that Yankee imperialism cannot be blamed for Venezuela emaciated tax system dismally bad schools rampant corruption high crime rate and feeble political institutions
In all of these areas Venezuela is faring poorly even by Latin America low standards
This is particularly true in the case of institutional weakness
When Chvez declares oribund a legitimate constitution or when he proclaims
None of these ideas would fly of course in a contented nation
In this sense Venezuela experience speaks to all of Latin America
The combination of economic growth now in reverse because of the global crisis and atrocious levels of inequality and social segmentation will continue to breed the same unmet expectations and social resentment that cleared Chvez path to power
As long as Latin America democracies fail to take seriously the tasks of reducing inequality spreading opportunity and nurturing more cohesive societies they will continue to court disaster
To avoid this outcome it is vital to purge certain reactionary and numbing beliefs including the idea that reducing poverty obviates the need to address inequality or that development is possible without introducing modern and progressive tax systems
If the tenth anniversary of Chvez tenure can serve as a reminder of the perils that beset unjust democracies  especially now that a new electoral cycle in Latin America looms  then Venezuela agonizing recent history would at least be redeemed
A Declaration of Americaus Interdependence
PRAGUE Many Americans seem overwhelmed by the feeling that because the Soviet Empire collapsed the dangers of war can be crossed off the list of potential risks
America they say should pay attention to its own problems and should not get involved in a world where its attempts to do good are rewarded with ingratitude
Isolationism has a long tradition in America it returns in fits and differing forms
Never in modern times however has isolationism protected America from danger instead it delays engagement when conflagrations are ablaze
Eventually America pays a thousand times more for its initial lack of interest than it would have paid had it become engaged at the outset of crisis or better yet even before
Americans pay for shortsightedness not only in larger expenditures but with lives wasted unnecessarily
So isolationism is shortsighted and never pays off
This is all the more true when defense of the values that America stands for is more difficult now than before
Previously the enemy was solitary armed to the teeth and quite predictable
The threats looming over todays world however are to the threat of communism as metastasis is to an isolated tumor
For the world is awash in dangers that are diverse decentralized yet intertwined and difficult to predict 
I believe that across the globe America is a symbolic concentration of all the good and bad within our civilization  from the fantastic development of science and technology to civil liberty and strong democratic institutions to the cult of perpetual economic growth and neverending consumption to the dictates of materialism and the voiding of human uniqueness by the uniformity of the roundtheclock noise of TV banality
For these reasons the ways in which America assumes its global responsibilities must embody those premises that alone may save civilization as a whole this way should be imbued with a new spirituality a new ethos and new ethics exactly with the things that should be adopted by all cultures all spheres of civilization and all nations of todays world as a condition of their survival
What does this mean in concrete terms
For one thing a respect for and understanding of the positive values inherent in other cultures
It also requires the courage to step out of the world of pragmatic power and defend  nonviolently  truth and justice wherever they are violated whether or not profitable commercial contracts are placed at risk
As for security matters I believe that in cases that are beyond any doubt America while enjoying the general support of freedomloving people and peaceful democracies must have the strength to intervene with force  that is by military means  against evil
The United States cannot and must not give up this obligation which is a very specific and extreme manifestation of its responsibility for the world
In the course of the Cold War America understood this though historians argue about the situations in which it tested its competence or the means it employed
It seems to me that after all the good and bad experiences America has had in the th century it should understand that the most effective most ethical and in the end the least expensive way of dealing with these challenges is to invest all its intellectual potential and a significant share of its material strength into what I call security prevention
Of course to predict and avert conflicts is more difficult than to engage and win them
Enlarging the North Atlantic Alliance is part of Americas reckoning with its destiny
Some Americans now maintain that NATO enlargement makes no sense
Why take in countries that were part of the Communist Empire and therefore somewhat suspect they say when the West faces no serious threats
Furthermore NATO enlargement might allegedly be resented by a certain large EuroAsian state and would cost taxpayers money
Such thoughts  after all we have endured in the th century when more than  million people died in wars and oncentration camps  are naive shortsighted even dangerous
Europe is a strange continent
Todays civilization was born within it but so were two World Wars
For the first time in its history Europe has a chance to establish its internal order on the principle of cooperation and equality of the large and the small the strong and the weak on shared democratic values
This is also a chance once and for all to put an end to the export of wars and coercion and to become an example of peaceful collaboration
Should Europe miss this chance we might head for a new global catastrophe even graver than previous ones
For reasons I have described this time the forces of freedom would not be facing one totalitarian enemy
Here would be a strange war of all against all war with no clearcut fronts war difficult to distinguish from terrorism genocide and organized crime war into which the whole world would be dragged by a myriad of indirect and hidden means
I dont mean to frighten but anybody with a little imagination and some knowledge of what has recently been going on  for example in Bosnia Herzegovina  must understand that this is not empty talk
If the ongoing process of European integration were to stop at the gates of todays NATO the consequences of such a rupture regardless of the form it assumes and regardless of whether they befall us in three years or fifteen could cost much more than the two World Wars Europe donated in this century combined
After prolonged hesitation the West took a step to avoid this threat in Madrid not long ago when it invited three former communist countries to join NATO
But this was the beginning not the end
Any judicious person must admit that the cost is worthwhile for the costliest preventive security is cheaper than the cheapest war
A Declaration of Independence from the US
George W Bush is obsessed with the war on terrorism especially with the military response to terrorism
American foreign policy reflects that obsession
This year the US will spend around  billion for the military including the costs of the Iraq War while it will spend no more than  billion to overcome global poverty global environmental degradation and global diseases
In other words US foreign policy spending is thirty times more focused on the military than on building global prosperity global public health and a sustainable environment
Throughout  the world lived with Bushs obsession
Debate over Iraq dominated international diplomacy and took up almost the entire UN agenda
The war in Iraq cost countless innocent lives such as when the UN headquarters in Baghdad was bombed
At the same time Bushs emphasis on a onedimensional militarized approach to global problems has fueled unrest and instability throughout the Islamic world leading to increased terrorism in Turkey North Africa Saudi Arabia and Southeast Asia
The nature of suffering around the world hardly justifies this narrow strategy
Focusing on terrorism to the exclusion of other issues and emphasizing the military response to it will not bring prosperity and peace or even a significant reduction in the number of attacks
While  innocent people died in the US on September   in Africa  innocent children die every day from malaria
Yet malaria is preventable and treatable
The problem is that most of Africa is too poor to mobilize the methods of prevention bed nets and treatments antimalarial medicines that could save millions of children every year
The US spends more on Iraq each day than it does on Africas malaria in a year
As  draws to a close it is time for world leaders to help guide the world away from the obsessive failing approach of Americas government
President Bush should be made to understand that the US will find no true international support if America speaks incessantly about terrorism while doing almost nothing about the problems that really affect most of the world poverty lack of access to safe water and sanitation vulnerability to disease and climate change
Ironically President Bush claims that the UN does not follow through on its word
He declared in London recently that the credibility of the UN depends on a willingness to keep its word and to act when action is required
Yet the US repeatedly violates its own UN pledges
For example at the International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey Mexico in March  America signed the Monterrey Consensus which includes a promise by rich countries to raise their development assistance towards  of national income
That would bring an additional  billion per year in foreign assistance from the USapproximately what it spent on Iraq this year
Yet President Bush has simply ignored this promise
There are many other similar commitments that the US has made in recent years to the UN that remain utterly unfulfilled
The US promised action to fight manmade climate change as a signatory to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCC in 
It has so far failed to act
America also promisedin the Doha Declaration in to open its markets to the worlds poorest countries
Yet at Cancun Mexico earlier this summer it refused to open its markets even to exports from struggling African economies
The list goes on and on
At the Millennium Assembly in  the US promised to pursue reduction of global poverty yet it has taken few steps in that direction
At the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in  America committed itself to protect global ecosystems yet little has been seen or heard from US policy makers on this issue since then
America is certainly not alone in failing to promote the international goals adopted in the UN
But because the US is the richest most powerful country in the world its neglect is devastating
If the US really wants to undercut terrorism it must recognize the interconnectedness of extremism poverty and environmental degradation and it will need to understand the struggles for survival that are underway among the poor everywhere
But the world should not wait for the America to come to its senses
The US represents just  of the worlds population and just one vote of  countries in the UN General Assembly
Poor countries especially the democracies of the developing worldBrazil South Africa India Mexico Ghana the Philippinesshould say We need to act on the issues that concern us not just on the issues that concern the US
What the world needs most in  is a declaration of independence from American willfulness
A Democratic Burma
TOKYO  Historic transformations often happen when least expected
Mikhail Gorbachev liberalizing policies of glasnost and perestroika in the Soviet Union emerged at one of the Cold War darkest hours with US President Ronald Reagan pushing for strategic missile defense and the two sides fighting proxy wars in Afghanistan and elsewhere
Deng Xiaoping economic opening followed China bloody  and failed  invasion of Vietnam in 
And South Africa last apartheid leader F W de Klerk was initially perceived as just another apologist for the system  hardly the man to free Nelson Mandela and oversee the end of white minority rule
Now the world is suddenly asking whether Burma Myanmar after six decades of military dictatorship has embarked on a genuine political transition that could end the country pariah status
Is Burma like South Africa under de Klerk truly poised to emerge from a halfcentury of selfimposed isolation
And can Aung San Suu Kyi the heroic opposition leader and Thein Sein Burma new president engineer a political transition as skillfully and peacefully as Mandela and de Klerk did for South Africa in the early 
Despite her two decades of house arrest and isolation Suu Kyi possesses two of the gifts that enabled Mandela to carry out his great task a reassuring serenity and an utter lack of vindictiveness
As Burma authorities test reform these gifts together with her negotiating skills and most of all her vast moral authority will be tested as never before
Moreover unlike Mandela during his year imprisonment Suu Kyi has had her hopes raised  and dashed  before
In the mid and again in  reconciliation between Suu Kyi National League for Democracy NLD and the military junta seemed to be in the offing
On both occasions however the regime hardliners gained the upper hand crushing prospects for reform
Yet Suu Kyi and much of the Burmese opposition is beginning to admit that today political liberalization might be the real thing
Because Burma generals say almost nothing in public it is difficult to fathom why they allowed elections that elevated Thein Sein to power or to explain their willingness to embrace dialogue with the longsuppressed opposition
Recent events suggest one possible explanation Burma rulers have grown wary of China almost smothering embrace  a result of the country international isolation
Indeed public protests against China commercial exploitation of Burma natural resources became so widespread that the government called a halt to construction by Chinese investors on the huge and environmentally damaging Myitsone Dam on the Irrawaddy River
Thein Sein decision to halt the project is clearly an important policy shift
It is also a signal to the outside world that Burma new government may be much more willing than any of its predecessors to heed both public pressure and international opinion both of which vehemently opposed the dam construction
Almost simultaneously Thein Sein offered even stronger signals that his was a very different Burmese administration he freed political prisoners and invited Suu Kyi for direct talks with him
Indeed Suu Kyi now enjoys far greater freedom of movement than she has at any time since she received the Nobel Peace Prize  years ago and the NLD recently announced that it will field candidates in the forthcoming byelections to the country newly established parliament
If Suu Kyi is permitted to campaign free of restraint for both her own seat and to boost the electoral chances of her NLD colleagues it will be clear that Thein Sein and his government are truly determined to bring their country in from the cold
For both Suu Kyi and Thein Sein every step from now on will be delicate to be calibrated with the same care and deliberation that Mandela and de Klerk used in bridging their differences and leading their country out of isolation
But the international community too must act with great care
While Thein Sein would undoubtedly wish to see the myriad economic and political sanctions imposed on Burma quickly lifted it is too soon for a general easing of such measures
But the outside world should demonstrate that every clear move toward greater political openness will merit more international political and economic engagement
The Japan Investment Bank decision to invest in port development in Burma  essential if the economy too is to be opened  is one positive sign that the world will keep pace with Thein Sein step for step
And US President Barack Obama decision to send Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to Burma to meet Thein Sein is another clear sign that the world is ready to end the country isolation
Closer to home ASEAN recent decision to give Burma a chance to chair the organization in  underscores its neighbors desire for the country full participation in Asia growing prosperity
No one should rush to judgment yet but Thein Sein decisions at least so far are beginning to resemble those of South Africa de Klerk when he initiated his country reform process
Fortunately Burma already has in Aung San Suu Kyi its very own Nelson Mandela
A Democratic Windfall for Turkey
Turkeys seeming fall from grace with the US may turn out to be a blessing in disguise
The Iraq war and the tortured diplomacy that led up to it may help resolve Turkeys conflict between its strategic alliance with America and its drive to join the EU
The elections last November that brought the Justice and Development Party AKP to power were preceded by a dispute between the members of the thenruling coalition over enacting the reforms demanded by the EU
Some liberal elements of that secular coalition resigned from the government and joined with the Islamists to push the reforms through parliament
After coming to power the AKPs leaders former Islamists who had reinvented themselves as conservative democrats energetically engaged with the US the EU and the UN on issues ranging from Cyprus to Iraq from Kurdish language rights to other human rights issues within Turkey
Having suffered the oppressive practices of Turkeys secular state and recognizing that human rights must be protected acrosstheboard the AKP emerged as a credible interlocutor with the West
The US preoccupied with the supposed specter of a clash of civilizations between Islam and the West saw the AKPs modern westernized face as an opportunity and urged the EU to admit Turkey
Today both conservative democrats and liberals advocate passing all the reforms needed to gain accession to the EU while opponents include extreme nationalists of both left and right as well as some elements of the secular establishment
The Europeans could have tipped the balance decisively in favor of the reformers by finally rewarding the efforts of the proEU Turks at last Decembers summit of EU leaders
Instead the EU kept Turkey waiting yet again putting off formal negotiations that in any case may take years to complete
Europes persistent reluctance puts the Turks in a quandary
The Americans want full EU membership for Turkeya longstanding NATO member and close American allywhile Europeans complain about the Turkish militarys domestic political role
The paradox is that by maintaining a political distance and thus limiting Turkeys options Europe may end up reinforcing Turkeys status as a military outpost of the US
At least that was how things were shaping up prior to the war in Iraq
Then despite massive US pressure Turkeys parliament unexpectedly rejected the governments proposal to allow US troops in Turkey to launch an invasion from Turkish territory
Turkeys refusal to grant the Americans access to military bases on its territory effectively ruled out a northern front in the war
The Turkish government even attempted a regional initiative for a peaceful solution to the crisis an effort no current EU member could have contemplated
Parliaments rejection of US troops powerfully refutes suggestions that Turkey was primarily concerned about the size of the American aid package on offer as an inducement to cooperate
Suggestions that characterized the vote as revealing the governments true Islamic character ignore the fact that the only opposition party in parliament the Republican Peoples Partyfounded by Atatrk and still fully secularistvoted against the plan
Likewise other elements of Turkeys secular establishment including the President and the military leadership either opposed or were lukewarm at best to the idea of war in Iraq
Turkeys military initially remained silent on the issue uncharacteristically watching the civilian political process unfold
By contrast the military had earlier publicly criticized AKP initiatives on Cyprus
Their silence on Iraq reflected their apprehension about unwanted alternatives either support the US plan and risk encouraging Kurdish moves toward an independent state or oppose the Americans and jeopardize a critical strategic relationship
They chose to defer to the civilian leadership and to parliament which in voting down the US plan reflected overwhelming public sentiment against the war
Only after the vote did the Chief of Staff publicly endorse the original proposal to bring in American troops
In fact the allegedly Islamic party had skilfully managed to negotiate with an unrelenting US consult with the Turkish military and President and share all information with the public and parliament
Walking a fine line in what was essentially a loselose situation the party leadership laid out the stakes clearly and judiciously left the final decision to parliament
The outcome was a victory for Turkish democracy and recognized as such internationally
After the US military action in Iraq the tables may be turning in surprising ways
As America establishes itself in Iraq Turkeys geopolitical military significance may decline
Yet the declared American aim of building a Muslim democracy in Iraq will only enhance Turkeys symbolic importance as a role model
This shift in Turkeys strategic role may also be reflected in a new domestic balance between the military and the forces pushing for reform
With careful management Turkey may find itself drawing closer to Europe while rebuilding its relationship with America
A Devaluation Option for Southern Europe
CAMBRIDGE  This year is likely to mark a makeorbreak ordeal for the euro
The eurozone survival demands a credible solution to its longrunning sovereigndebt crisis which in turn requires addressing the two macroeconomic imbalances nbspexternal and fiscal nbspwhich are at the heart of that crisis
The crisis has exposed the deep disparities in competitiveness that have developed within the eurozone
From  to  unit labor costs in Germany increased by just  and by  in France
Compare that to  in Portugal  in Spain  in Italy and a whopping  in Greece
The result has been large trade imbalances between eurozone countries a problem compounded by large fiscal deficits and high levels of public debt in southern Europe and France  much of it owed to foreign creditors
Does addressing these imbalances require breaking up the eurozone
Suppose for example that Portugal were to leave and reintroduce the escudo
The ensuing exchangerate devaluation would immediately lower the price of Portugal exports raise its import prices stimulate the economy and bring about muchneeded growth
But a euro exit would be a messy affair
The resulting turmoil could very well trump any shortterm gains in competitiveness from devaluation
There is a remarkably simple alternative that does not require southern Europe troubled economies to abandon the euro and devalue their exchange rates
It involves increasing the valueadded tax while cutting payroll taxes
Our recent research demonstrates that such a iscal devaluation has very similar effects on the economy in terms of its impact on GDP consumption employment and inflation
A currency devaluation works by making imports more costly and exports cheaper
A VATpayrolltax swap would do exactly the same thing
An increase in VAT raises the price of imported goods as foreign firms face a higher tax
To ensure that domestic firms do not have an incentive to raise prices an increase in VAT needs to be accompanied by a cut in payroll taxes
Moreover since exports are exempt from VAT the price of domestic exports will fall
The desired competitiveness effects of exchangerate devaluation can thus be had while staying in the euro
This policy can also help on the fiscal front
As is true of an exchangerate devaluation the positive impact on growth of an increase in competitiveness can strengthen the fiscal position by raising tax revenues
Moreover an important advantage of fiscal devaluations is that they generate additional revenues in proportion to the country trade deficit
For countries that are suffering from weak competitiveness and as a consequence running trade deficits this typically means more revenues especially in the short run
Like exchangerate devaluations fiscal devaluations create winners and losers
Both act as a wealth levy inflation means that bondholders suffer a real loss in proportion to their wealth and the size of the devaluation
If taxes on capital are not adjusted holders of domestic stocks suffer a comparable loss
By contrast many transfers such as unemployment benefits health benefits and public pensions are indexed to inflation and thus maintain their real value
The same is true of minimum wages
These distributive effects play an important role in the politics of exchangerate devaluations and most of these effects appear in fiscal devaluations as well
Fiscal devaluations already have some advocates
Indeed French President Nicolas Sarkozy government just announced one
And concerns that a fiscal devaluation will conflict with euro rules can be met by simply pointing out that Germany government carried one out in  though by another name when it raised VAT from  to  and cut employers contribution to social insurance from  to 
In short there are simple fiscal alternatives to exchangerate devaluation that can address southern Europe shortterm competitiveness problems
To be sure feasible fiscal devaluations would be limited in size
But together with debt restructuring accommodative monetary policy liquidity support from the European Central Bank and muchrequired structural reforms they can help to put these troubled economies on a sound footing without a euro breakup or a major austerityinduced recession
A Dim Light on Global Warming
COPENHAGEN  Amid a growing wave of concern about climate change many countries  including Brazil Australia the United States and the members of the European Union  passed laws in the  outlawing or severely restricting access to incandescent light bulbs
The intention was understandable if everyone in the world exchanged most light bulbs for energyefficient compact fluorescent light bulbs CFLs we could save  of all electricity or  of our CO emissions
The current attempt by Republicans in the US Congress to roll back America effort to ban incandescent bulbs has revived this discussion
Many contend that the agenda is being driven by knuckledragging climatechange deniers
But it worth taking a closer look at the premise that banning things is the smartest way to tackle global warming
Let be clear we do need to tackle climate change
But this does not mean that we should just cut all emissions
Burning fossil fuels also has significant benefits and we should weigh those benefits against the costs
A tax on carbon should be equivalent to its damage
The best estimate of this is about ton of CO or gallon of gasoline liter
Most developed countries already have a tax of this size and often much larger on electricity and fossil fuels although this also incorporates the costs of air pollution and supply insecurity
While CFLs are more expensive to buy they are much cheaper over their lifespan because they use much less energy even more so with the cost of CO factored into taxes on electricity
Thus on a straightforward costbenefit basis it seems to make sense for most people to switch from incandescent bulbs to the new greener technology
This is what is great about technological solutions to climate change if an alternative option is cheaper people will start using it
My household uses CFLs and I enjoy knowing that I am causing fewer CO emissions and spending less money
Why then is it even necessary to outlaw the old bulbs
The reason is that monetary cost is only one factor
Many people find it annoying that CFLs take time to arm up
Or they believe that their light is unny
Or they worry that the bulbs can spread poisonous mercury if they break
For some people energyefficient bulbs can trigger epileptic seizures and migraines
The upfront cost is a factor too especially for those on low budgets
And in places where lights are not used very often a lowerprice incandescent bulb can cost less overall than the energyefficient alternative
You might imagine that people could choose the right light bulbs for themselves
But proponents of phasing out access to incandescent bulbs argue that they know better
As US Energy Secretary Steven Chu put it recently e are taking away a choice that continues to let people waste their own money
Setting aside other possible objections to this view there is the problem that it presumes that all incandescent bulbs are worth less than ton of CO
This is clearly not true for those who suffer from migraines or epileptic seizures because of the new bulbs or for those who are seriously worried about mercury or for those who have other reasons for preferring incandescent bulbs
The solution should be to focus on improving the technology  making the lights safer brighter warm up faster and save more energy so that more people will replace more of their lights
But it is not just light bulbs that policymakers have tried to ban
EU parliamentarians voted overwhelmingly to outlaw patio heaters which one MEP declared to be  luxury the planet cannot afford
Who decides when something is luxurious
And where does this end
Should we outlaw air conditioning or television satellite boxes because some people find them luxurious
Should we ban private cars wherever public transport is available to move us from A to B with fewer CO emissions
It makes sense to reflect the cost of CO among many other factors in the price paid to drive our cars or heat our patios but when the phaseout proceeds more slowly than some lawmakers wish a ban is not the right solution
Real reductions in carbon emissions will occur only when better technology makes it worthwhile for individuals and businesses to change their behavior
CFLs and other advances can take us part of the way but there are massive technological hurdles to overcome before fossil fuels generally become less attractive than greener alternatives
This is where a lot of policymakers get it wrong
Governments talk far too much about setting a relatively high carbon tax on emissions while focusing far too little on ensuring a meaningful increase in research and development to bring about necessary breakthroughs
Limiting access to the rong light bulbs or patio heaters ultimately is not the right path
We will only solve global warming by ensuring that alternative technologies are better than our current options
Then people the world over will choose to use them
A Dissident in China
TOKYO   was a good year for China
The Chinese economy still roared ahead in the midst of a worldwide recession
American President Barack Obama visited China more in the spirit of a supplicant to an imperial court than the leader of the world greatest superpower
Even the Copenhagen summit on climate change ended just the way China wanted failure in its attempt to commit China or any other industrial nation to making significant cuts in carbon emissions with the United States getting the blame
The Chinese government under the Communist Party has every reason to feel confident
So why did a gentle former literature professor named Liu Xiaobo have to be sentenced to  years in prison just because he publicly advocated freedom of expression and an end to oneparty rule
Liu was coauthor in  of a petition Charter  signed by thousands of Chinese calling for basic rights to be respected
Liu is not a violent rebel
His opinions in articles published on the Internet are entirely peaceful
Yet he was jailed for nciting subversion of state power
The notion that Liu might be capable of subverting the immense power of the Communist Party of China is patently absurd
And yet the authorities clearly believe that they had to make an example of him to prevent others from expressing similar views
Why does a regime that appears to be so secure consider mere opinions or even peaceful petitions so dangerous
Perhaps because the regime does not feel as secure as it looks
Without legitimacy no government can rule with any sense of confidence
There are many ways to legitimize political arrangements
Liberal democracy is only a recent invention
Hereditary monarchy often backed by divine authority has worked in the past
And some modern autocrats such as Robert Mugabe have been bolstered by their credentials as national freedom fighters
China has changed a great deal in the last century but it has remained the same in one respect it is still ruled by a religious concept of politics
Legitimacy is not based on the give and take the necessary compromises and the wheeling and dealing that form the basis of an economic concept of politics such as that which underpins liberal democracy
Instead the foundation of religious politics is a shared belief imposed from above in ideological orthodoxy
In imperial China this meant Confucian orthodoxy
The ideal of the Confucian state is armony
If all people conform to a particular set of beliefs including moral codes of behavior conflicts will disappear
The ruled in this ideal system will naturally obey their rulers just as sons obey their fathers
After the various revolutions in the early decades of the twentieth century Confucianism was replaced by a Chinese version of Communism
Marxism appealed to Chinese intellectuals because it was bookish introduced a modern moral orthodoxy and was based like Confucianism on a promise of perfect harmony
Ultimately in the Communist utopia conflicts of interests would melt away
Chairman Mao rule combined elements of the Chinese imperial system with Communist totalitarianism
This orthodoxy however was also destined to fade away
Few Chinese even in the top ranks of the Communist Party are convinced Marxists anymore
This left an ideological vacuum swiftly filled in the  by greed cynicism and corruption
Out of this crisis came the demonstrations all over China collectively known as iananmen
Liu Xiaobo was an active spokesman in  for the student protests against official corruption and in favor of greater freedom
Soon after the bloody crackdown on Tiananmen a new orthodoxy replaced Chinese Marxism Chinese nationalism
Only oneparty rule would guarantee the continuing rise of China and put an end to centuries of national humiliation
The Communist Party represented China destiny as a great power
To doubt this was not just mistaken but unpatriotic even ntiChinese
From this perspective Liu Xiaobo critical views were indeed subversive
They cast doubt on the official orthodoxy and thus on the legitimacy of the state
To wonder as many have why the Chinese regime refused to negotiate with the students in   or to find some accommodation with its critics today  is to misunderstand the nature of religious politics
Negotiation compromise and accommodation are the marks of economic politics where every deal has its price
By contrast those who rule according to a shared belief cannot afford to negotiate for that would undermine the belief itself
This is not to say that the economic concept of politics is utterly strange to the Chinese  or for that matter that the religious notion of politics is unknown in the democratic West
But the insistence on orthodoxy is still sufficiently strong in China to remain the default defense against political critics
These things can change
Other Confucian societies such as South Korea Taiwan and Japan now have thriving liberal democracies and there is no reason to believe that such a transition is impossible in China
But external pressure is unlikely to bring it about
Many nonChinese including me have signed a letter of protest against the jailing of Liu Xiaobo
One hopes that this will lend comfort to him and give a moral boost to Chinese who share his views
But it is unlikely to impress those who believe in the current orthodoxy of Chinese nationalism
Until China is released from the grip of religious politics Liu ideals are unlikely to take root
This does not bode well for China or indeed for the rest of the world
A Doomsday Scenario
As America debates whether or not to invade Iraq fears that the countrys economic recovery will stall are beginning to creep into the discussion with that worries about the health of the global economy are growing too
A consensus is emerging that the gap between the US economys growth potential and its actual performance will remain large for some time to come
Can the situation get worse
Yes it can much worse
A number of worrying factors about the US economy have been around for a long time
huge trade deficits have persisted since Ronald Reagans misguided tax cuts of  converted America from the worlds largest creditor into the worlds largest debtor
Today these deficits set new records by the month
Americas appallingly low savings rate
When American wealth seemed to be growing year after year as the stock market boomed this was understandable individual Americans were becoming richer without savings so why bother
Todays savings rate while it has increased slightly still finds America at the bottom of the worlds savings league tables
lax accounting standards
The Arthur Anderson Enron and WorldCom scandals didnt emerge out of thin air but had their origins in the mids when the US Treasury actually intervened to stop attempts by the supposedly independent accounting standards board to improve matters
Bad accounting contributed to the recent stock market bubble bad information led to stock prices that did not reflect underlying realities and these in turn provided incentives for the excess investment in telecoms that caused todays excess capacity
To this old brew new ingredients have been added notably the most rapid change in a nations fiscal posture the world has probably ever seen
In a now you see it now you dont move only a magician should love the  trillion ten year non social security US budget surplus was  in a matter of months  converted into a gaping
Of course excuses are at hand the magnitude of the economic downturn was not anticipated and the increased expenditures to fight terrorism could not be foretold
Excuses excuses
As the old saying goes Dont count your chickens before they hatch
The Bush Administration not only counted its chickens it sold them forward
To anyone with decent eyesight it was clear that the rosy budget projections of two years ago were nonsense
Clear too was the fact that in promoting its tax cuts the Bush Administration was engaging on a multibillion dollar scale in dishonest Enronlike accounting
So if things are so bad now how can they get worse
Heres a plausible scenario
To finance its trade deficit America must borrow from abroad over a billion dollars a day
When America was the only safe haven for global investors this was easy
But America today appears less safe
The combination of lack of confidence in US corporate accounts lack of confidence in Americas economic policy management compounded by the mounting deficits and Americas soft underlying economic fundamentals has dented the US economys global reputation
As foreigners start pulling their money out of a country they suspect the dollar will weaken
As the dollar weakens America looks even less safe
So a rush to the door begins
While a weak dollar may be good for exports a falling dollar will be accompanied by stock market losses and greater declines in confidence
Eventually even the almighty American consumer will be shaken and realize that he is poorer today than three years ago and that he better start putting money away for his retirement especially given Bushs proposed risky experiments with the social security system
At that point Americans will join the stampede out of their economy
Why shouldnt they
Theyre free to choose where to put their money
Europes stock markets will begin to look like an attractive alternative
But this scenario offers no happy ending for Europe
A weakening US economy and the strengthening Euro will dampen European exports
The European Central Bank fixated on inflation will be slow to lower interest rates and the European Stability Pact will make it impossible for fiscal policy to offset these weaknesses
Europe will join America in a downturn reinforcing Americas decline and setting in motion a global downward spiral
I am not predicting that this will happen
I hope that the Bush Administration will enact policies to strengthen the US economy a tax cut that might made minimal sense when it
America is strong and the global economy is strong
Should the disastrous events contemplated here occur a new global economy will eventually emerge from the ashes
Downturns of course can never be fully prevented
We can however decrease their frequency we can make them shallower we can ensure that fewer people are hurt and that those that get hurt are better protected
Sadly we are doing less than is possible to prevent things from getting worse and doing less than necessary to protect ourselves from the consequences
A DoubleDip Recession for the US
Last winter Americas central bank  the Federal Reserve  was busy patting itself on the back
The Feds cut in its basic interest rate to  per year seemed to have worked the recession was ending
Despite sobered expectations about the hightech revolutions impact on productivity and profits as well as the jitters inspired by the terror attack on the World Trade Center American businesses it was believed would soon start investing again bigtime because borrowing money at  was too good a deal to pass up
By late spring those expectations had disintegrated alongside the collapse of Enron WorldCom and Arthur Andersen
Suddenly everyone doubted the integrity of the financial accounts of American companies
Suddenly everyone saw just how much Americas system of corporate surveillance and control had deteriorated during the bubble of the s
The American stock market fell  below its winter levels
Spreads between the interest rate at which Americas government could borrow and the interest rates at which Americas corporations could borrow widened
Suddenly the Fed stopped congratulating itself a  interest rate might be the right interest rate to fuel a recovery when the DowJones stock market index stands at  but not when the DowJones index stands at 
Throughout the summer corporate investment news remained disappointing
More and more analysts began to speak about the possibility of a double dip recession
Yet throughout all this the Federal Reserve remained passive
The shortterm interest rates it controlled didnt budge
Only in midAugust did the Fed hint that interest rates might be cut
The informal and unofficial rationale leaking out of the Fed for its inaction had two parts
First shortterm interest rates were already so low that everyone would see further cuts as temporary only
They would thus have little effect on the longerterm rates that really drive business investment
Second shortterm interest rates were so low that additional cuts would spook the financial markets if even the Fed thought conditions warranted cuts the argument went businesses would respond not by increasing their investments but by reducing them
The Feds judgment appeared to be that it was largely if not completely powerless it had done all that it could and the levers of monetary policy were no longer strongly connected to determining the level of economic activity
So the US in  joined Japan in what economists have for sixtyfive years called a Liquidity Trap a situation in which the shortterm nominal interest rates the central bank controls are so low and so loosely connected to the level of aggregate demand that further reductions are ineffective in fighting a recession
Americas situation was not unique Japan had been in been in thrall to a liquidity trap since the mids
But there had been no other examples since the Great Depression of the s
Whether America now really is in a liquidity trap is uncertain
How long this state of affairs will last is unknown
Nevertheless even if America is only on the edge of a liquidity trap and even if it moves away from the current state of affairs soon this is a frightening situation
If monetary policy is not effective the only lever the American government has to manage its economy is fiscal policy changes in the governments tax and spending plans to change the governments direct contribution to aggregate demand
But the lesson of the decades since World War II is that the US government  with its complex baroque eighteenthcentury organization  is incapable of changing policy fast enough to make effective use of fiscal policy as a tool for managing the economy
It simply takes too long for changes in taxes and spending to work their way through Congress and the bureaucracy
An America caught in a liquidity trap is quite simply a country with no effective tools of macroeconomic management
There have been two eras since World War II when policymakers  American policymakers at least  believed that they had solved the riddle of the business cycle and had learned how to manage a modern industrial or postindustrial economy
The first was the Keynesian highwater mark of confidence in demand management of the s
It was destroyed by the inflation of the Vietnam era and the oilprice shocks of the s
The second was the decade of successful businesscycle management by Alan Greenspans independent apolitical and technocratic Fed during the s
This second era now appears to have been as fleeting as the first
Eighty years ago John Maynard Keynes argued that governments needed to take responsibility for maintaining full employment and price stability  that the preWorld War I gold standard had not been the golden age people thought it was and that its successes were the result of a lucky combination of circumstances unlikely to be repeated
Keynes was an optimist in believing that governments could learn to manage the business cycle
He would be shocked to look at todays world a Europe with stubbornly high unemployment a Japan mired in a decade of near stagnation and now an America lacking the policy tools to deal with any additional unexpected economic bad news
A Drug War on AutoPilot
THE HAGUE  The war in Afghanistan now approaching its tenth year may seem to many to have no end in sight but Latin America has endured an even longer fight one that has recently become much more bloody the ar against drug trafficking
So rote  and so violent  has that war become that many people in Latin America now wonder which side is suffering the more pathological addiction
The new strategy that US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been promoting to staunch the upward trend of narcotraffickingrelated murders  which leaked Mexican government reports put at more than  since late   is to build tronger more resilient communities
Ciudad Jurez a sprawling Mexican border town that is now the homicide capital of the world would have to be high on the list
Four bridges and innumerable tunnels and drainage canals connect Ciudad Jurez and El Paso Texas
Rival cartels sparring for control of a plaza the name given to any trafficking route butcher each other and the security forces
There is apparently no shortage of young unemployed men willing to join the carnage
Addressing the deepseated social and economic problems of a city like Jurez however is a lot harder than flooding its streets with  soldiers carrying assault rifles
Mexican President Felipe Caldern has in this respect remained faithful to the script written in previous theaters in the drug war whether in Bolivia Colombia or Peru where governments have used military force and extradition to placate the US and punish those with the least voice and influence
But the language used by the Obama administration to describe the violence and state corruption that snakes from the Andes to the US border is starting to capture new thinking on narcotics
Three former Latin American presidents Mexico second richest man Ricardo Salinas and the Supreme Court of Argentina among others have criticized the war on drugs as a manifest failure that has lowered street prices fueled production and undermined weak states
More strikingly both Bolivia and Ecuador are governed by presidents who suffered directly from the collateral insensitivities of the war on drugs
Bolivia Evo Morales rose to prominence as leader of the country coca growers during a brutal campaign to wipe out their crops the socalled Dignity Plan
Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa father was jailed for smuggling drugs to the US when the future leader was five years old
These leaders profound ambivalence toward the goal of a world free of illegal drugs is shared by the European Union where restrictions on narcotics consumption have slackened over the past decade
The past three US presidents furthermore have all admitted to consuming  to one extent or another  illegal psychoactive substances while seven million Americans according to the United Nations are regular cocaine users
But the inertia of a bureaucratic drugenforcement superstructure worth approximately  billion each in the US and the EU sustained by a deepseated fear of the hreat posed by drugs and cartels appears to push policy repeatedly towards the familiar option of repressive autopilot
For example US support for Mexico campaign against the cartels looks set in stone with Congress apparently ready to provide  million for another year of military and security upgrading
In Colombia seven new joint military installations are planned and support for US private contractors who have cornered the market in crop fumigation presumably will not be interrupted
Nevertheless as the flaws in the fourdecadeold edifice of counternarcotics become more visible it is increasingly difficult to regard the risks of drug use as being greater than the damage done by repression
Prohibition hikes the markup on prices  an astounding  in the case of cocaine traveling to Europe from Andean processing facilities
While the war on drugs focuses on bringing down cartels and their kingpins it perversely aids the health of their markets which nestle within legitimate trade flows and respond to price incentives
Interviewed by the Mexican magazine Proceso this year the secondincommand of the giant Sinaloa cartel Ismael Zambada made the point clearly he narco problem involves millions of people
How do you control it
The capos can be jailed killed or extradited but their replacements are already wandering around
The emergence of Latin America powerful drug mafias cannot be traced to the radical evil of certain individuals
These people emerged under conditions created in deeply inequitable societies by a misapplied inconsistent and bureaucratic war
Indeed the furies of the Zetas in Mexico originate in the counterinsurgency training provided in the  to a select group of specialforces soldiers who later deserted
The Zetas star recruits in recent years have come from the Guatemalan military special forces whose infamous induction technique involved biting off the head of a live chicken
Meanwhile in Jamaica and across the rural outposts of Central America drug lords have become benefactors and heroes to the poor
It is time for serious reconsideration of the status and regulation of illegal drugs pointing to selective legalization as well as reclassification of the market as a publichealth rather than a criminal concern
For now policymakers across the Americas are tiptoeing towards the obvious
A Dutch Pontius Pilate in Srebrenica
The British diplomat and historian Harold Nicholson once said that a diplomat is an honest gentlemen sent abroad to tell lies for his countrys good
Recent official reports from The Hague regarding the conduct of the Dutch Battalion in Sreberenica in Bosnia in l may suggest that sometimes UN Blue Helmets are honest people sent abroad to protect victims of aggression  and may find themselves in the position of facilitating genocide
This is perhaps not exactly what happened with the Dutch Battalion in Srebrenica but the recent page report of the Dutch Institute for War Documentation NIO suggests that when it comes to taking responsibility for the hideous massacre of  Bosnian Muslims under the eyes of a UN protective force UNPROFOR in Srebrenica everyone now washes their hands and looks somewhere else to find who is responsible
The details of what happened in the UN protected area of Srebrenica in July l are complex and obviously a Rashomonlike set of accounts is what one would get under such circumstances
Even the Dutch report for all its attempted fairness cannot give a full authorized picture
Yet a
few facts are incontestable
Srebrenica was a UN protected zone a Muslim enclave in a Serbheld region
When the Bosnian Serbs under General Ratko Mladic occupied the town the Dutch Battalion though obviously outnumbered did not oppose the military Serb action such opposition was also not in its formal mandate  after all the Dutch were supposed to be neutral
Dutch officers were present when the Serbs gathered together the Muslim civilian population of Srebrenica and separated the men from women and children taking the men away the Dutch did not object nor did they try to confront the Serb forces with the idea that what they were doing is unacceptable
It is obvious that the Dutch Battalion could not militarily stop the Serbs from doing what they were doing yet there are always other options besides shooting  or washing your hands and doing nothing
It is clear that the outcome would have been different if the Dutch Battalion regardless of its legalistic mandate and inferior power would have threatened the Serbs with resisting the separation of Muslim men from Muslim women
A credible threat of the use of power has a wonderful capacity to concentrate even a murderers mind
Imagine the following what would have happened if the Dutch commander instead of meeting with the Serb commanders over beer yes this happened would have told Mladic Only over our dead bodies
I can imagine that if the Dutch had been there protecting Dutch women and children they would not have been as passive
Indeed they were not completely passive when confronted with the problem of saving their own lives or of negotiating the release of some of their comrades who were taken hostage by the Serbs
But when the victims were mere Bosnian Muslims basic humanity receded behind legalistic humbug and indifference
The consequence of the shameful behavior of the Dutch is that the UN was complicit in war crimes  and  Muslim men were brutally massacred in Srebrenica
Some of this raises memory of the shameful visits during World War II of the International Committee of the Red Cross to the Nazi camp at Theresienstadt the Red Cross basically found conditions satisfactory though obviously not easy
The inability of the official Dutch report to clearly accept responsibility for the failures of the Dutch Battalion underlines once more the bankruptcy of so many UN peacekeeping operations they have no mandate to stop aggression forcibly and they are supposed to be neutral
But there can be no neutrality between murderers and victims  yet neutrality is what the UNcontrolled forces in Bosnia sought
An end to the massacres came only when the US and NATO decided to use force against the Serbs
Similarlythe UN and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE sponsored attemps to stop Serb violence in Kosovo also failed only NATO by using force succeeded in putting an end to Serb massacres of the Albanian population
Neither the Bosnian nor the Kosovo problems have yet found a permnanet solution the killings however have stopped
There are moments when unwillingness to use force is immoral and moments when the measured use  or threat of use  of force may be the only moral alternative
Srebrenica is a moral stain on the UN and UNsponsored forces and the lesson should be heeded for the future
In Srebrenica Pontius Pilate would have felt vindicated humanity once again was found to be wanting
A Dutch Treat for Brazil
Brazils successful return to the financial markets at the end of April and the strengthening of the countrys currency the real have shown that the election of President Luiz Incio da Silva Lula has not led to a collapse of foreign confidence
But nor do recent positive developments eliminate the need for structural economic reforms
Lula recognizes that progress in this area including labor market reform is critical if Brazil is to grow sufficiently to allow him to carry on his ambitious social agenda
How Lula a former metal worker and founder of CUT which also represents most automobile workers manages relations with the trade unions will be critical
Recent strikes by car workers at General Motors Renault Volvo and Ford factories in Brazil do not augur well
Proposed social security and tax reforms presented to Congress at the end of April seem to be creating additional tension
Lula should look to Europe for examples of how to achieve high rates of growth and job creation yet maintain social protection
Europe also can provide a roadmap for politicians determined to move from being antimarket leftwingers in opposition to reformminded statesmen holding power
Spains Felipe Gonzlez and Britains Tony Blair both made that journey
But a better example may be Wim Kok who stepped down last year after eight years as Dutch Prime Minister
Both Lula and Kok share the unusual distinction of becoming heads of government after serving as trade union leaders
Upon reaching the top of the FNV Hollands largest trade union Kok found himself in a position of considerable influence in Dutch economic policymaking
During his tenure as a union leader in the late s and early s the Dutch economy experienced prolonged malaisestagnant growth high unemployment prohibitive interest rates and low corporate profitability
Large fiscal deficits crowded out private investment
Hollands problems were mainly structural although a cyclical economic downturn made matters worse
By  the situation had deteriorated to the point that the social partners in the Dutch tripartite system government business and trade unions concluded that combating the crisis required a break with the past
The defining moment came with the Wassenaar agreement of that yeara pact between employers and trade unions reached with the active encouragement of government
Trade unions agreed to moderate wage claims and abandon wage indexation in exchange for reduced working time and improved prospects for the future
The increased flexibility of the Dutch labor market eventually restored privatesector profitability and led to rapid job creation among the highest in Europe and comparable to the rate in the US
A prudent fiscal stance pursued while the economy recovered and interest rates fell created room for big cuts in taxes and social contributions
With lower inflation this raised workers real disposable income enabling trade union leaders to demonstrate to their members that wage moderation worked and was in their interest
The recent much weaker performance of the Dutch economy is largely explained by strong wage increases which undermined competitiveness and contributed to job extinction
This prompted Kok to call last yearon the 
How is the Wassenaar model relevant to Brazil
Not unlike Holland in the early s Brazils economy today faces the challenge of stimulating rapid employment growth amid fiscal constraints and high interest rates
While Brazils registered unemployment rate is not very high by regional standards its fast growing labor force requires a high rate of job creation
Emulating the Dutch experience with job creation provides the surest possible path to alleviating poverty in Brazil
The idea is not that Brazil should seek to implement the Dutch socialeconomic modelthe countries are too different for that
But Lula can and should follow Koks example and use his trade union connections as well as his rapport with the working class to achieve a social pact aimed at achieving sustained improvement in Brazils overall economic performance and realizing its potential to become Latin Americas economic powerhouse
Brazil has benefited from an improvement in market sentiment and financial indicators since Lulas election
Now its government should encourage a Wassenaarstyle guarantee of social peace
This would give the authorities room to address the countrys daunting longerterm policy agendaincluding a major reform of the costly pension system an overhaul of the tax system and strengthening the bankruptcy frameworkthat Brazil must face in order to boost competitiveness
Lulas countrymen who elected him overwhelmingly need rapid economic growth and job creation
That will happen only if Lula completes a successful transformation from antimarket trade union leader into a statesman judiciously blending economic and social reform
Success would benefit not only Brazil but have a strong demonstration effect across Latin America
A Euro Sabbatical
MUNICH  Under substantial external pressure the eurozone crisishit countries are at long last bringing themselves to make painful cuts in their government budgets
Salaries are being slashed and public employees sacked to reduce new borrowing to a tolerable level
And yet competitiveness in Greece and Portugal in particular is not improving
The latest Eurostat figures on the evolution of the price index for selfproduced goods GDP deflator show no tendency whatsoever in the crisisstricken countries towards real devaluation
But real devaluation achieved by lowering prices visvis their eurozone competitors is the only way to reestablish these countries competitiveness
A reduction in unit labor costs can also increase competitiveness only to the extent that it actually results in price reductions
After all it was price inflation in the crisis countries fueled by massive inflows of cheap credit following the introduction of the euro that resulted in their loss of competitiveness ballooning currentaccount deficits and accumulation of enormous foreign debt
Now that capital markets are no longer willing to finance these deficits prices should be going into reverse but this obviously is not happening
In  inflation in some of the crisis countries lagged slightly behind that of their eurozone competitors
The latest Eurostat figures for the third quarter of  however are already showing a different picture the price level in Portugal and Greece has remained practically unchanged over the course of the year and in Italy and Spain it even rose slightly by  and  respectively
Only Ireland continued on a path of rapid deflation  as it has since the country realestate bubble burst in   with a relative price decrease of 
On the whole Ireland has become cheaper relative to its eurozone competitors by a total of  over the course of the past five years
This internal devaluation is paying off while Ireland was still running a currentaccount deficit of  of GDP in  the European Commission expects the outturn for  to have been a ofGDP currentaccount surplus
True much of this is mere debtservice relief given that Ireland was able to repay its foreign liabilities with selfprinted money for which it pays only  interest
However Ireland big trade surplus did improve further
Ireland owes much of this turnaround to its efficient export sector whose supporters were able to enforce a political Uturn
Greece on the other hand is under the influence of a strong import lobby
As the Greek economics minister Michalis Chrysochoidis has said this is attributable to European Union subsidies which drove entrepreneurs to follow the easy money into the import sector
Now these importers form a powerful bulwark against any policy that causes deflation even though lowering prices  and thereby redirecting Greek demand from foreign to domestic products and helping tourism  is the only way to put the Greek economy back on its feet
Since Greece currentaccount deficit as a share of GDP was three times higher than Ireland Greek prices would have to fall by about half to achieve the same kind of success
It is inconceivable that Greece could manage that within the eurozone without widespread social unrest if not conditions approaching those of civil war
But it isn just importers who are blocking real devaluation
Unions too are resisting the necessary wage reductions and public and private debtors fear the prospect of insolvency if their assets and revenues are assessed at a lower value while their debts remain unchanged
The situation is intractable
Many people regard debt relief and socialization of debts as the only way out
This help has been given
The recent agreement gave Greece relief of  billion  billion about  more than Greece net national income of roughly  billion eurosBut such help only entrenches the wrong prices  and thus the economy lack of competitiveness
The debts will reemerge like a tumor growing year by year while undermining the creditworthiness of stable eurozone countries
If that happened the euro would eventually collapse
Only a price reduction would create currentaccount surpluses and enable the crisis countries to pay off their foreign debts
It is time for Europe to come to terms with this remorseless truth
Those crisis countries that do not want to take it upon themselves to lower their prices should be given the opportunity to leave the eurozone temporarily in order to devalue prices and debts
In other words they should take a kind of euro sabbatical  a proposal that has now also been taken up by American economist Kenneth Rogoff
After the ensuing financial thunderstorm died down the sun would come out again very quickly
The creditor countries would have to shoulder big losses from writedowns but they would still end up with more than they would have gotten had the crisis countries remained within the eurozone because these countries new prosperity gained by leaving offers the only chance of recovering any assets at all
A Europe for All
Longtime members of the European Union now seem to doubt the Union future but we in Ukraine look at the European Union with hope and admiration
To join in the EU progress is the basic object of our foreign policy for Ukraine has discovered that nationhood is not an end but a beginning
Indeed European unity is indivisible when one nation is ostracized all are not free
We Europeans are caught in an inescapable net tied in a single garment of destiny
Every aspect of our shared culture if not the last century of shared suffering confirms that for us
Whatever affects one European directly affects all indirectly
Never again can we afford to live with the narrow notion of two Europes of haves and havenots of insiders and outsiders
Anyone who lives within the European continent cannot  indeed must not  be considered a stranger to its Union
Today great Pax Europa and today panEuropean prosperity depend on this
Of course some people mutter that Ukraine is not Europe
Let them come to Kyiv and speak to the people young and old factory worker farmer wife the lawyers and doctors and teachers who stood and stayed in the cold and snow for weeks on end last winter to defend their freedoms
Are they not united with those who stood alongside General de Gaulle in the French Resistance
Are they not one with those who died fighting for the Spanish Republic in the  who liberated Budapest in  and ended fascism in Spain and Portugal in the 
Are they not animated by the same spirit as Poland Solidarity and the peaceful masses that created Prague Velvet Revolution in 
That is the true European spirit and no doubts can crush it
To those who say that Ukraine is too backward for EU membership I say Let them too come to my country and see the mothers who stay late at night at work teaching their children to use their workplace computer
Let them come to the language classes in every village and city where young people are readying themselves for Europe by learning French and German and English
I believe that our future is as promising as Europe past is proud and that our destiny lies not as a forgotten borderland on a troubled region but as a maker and shaper of Europe peace and Europe unity
Selfdetermination no longer means isolation because achieving national independence nowadays means only to return to the world scene with a new status
New nations can build with their former occupiers the same kind of fruitful relationship that France established with Germany  a relationship founded on equality and mutual interests
That is the type of relationship that my government seeks with Russia and achieving it is how we can help extend the zone of Europe peace
Of course it is premature to do more than indicate the high regard with which we view the prospect of EU membership
We know that our part in that great edifice will not be built overnight
We know that the great works of European unification lay not in documents and declarations but in innovative action designed to better the lives and insure the security of all Europeans
Building a Ukraine worthy of EU membership will not be easy cheap or fast
But like the Union itself it will be built and it will be done
We know the challenge is great but the prize is worth the struggle and Europe should know that this is our goal
Part of the work of renewing Ukraine is a creative battle to put an end to a nightmarish century during which fascism and communism  ideologies born in the heart of Europe  battled for mastery
Only a few months ago in cities throughout Ukraine our children and our parents confronted armed troops snarling dogs and even death
Only a few years ago a young journalist Georgi Gongadze seeking to inform the public about our old regime corruption was brutalized and beheaded by that regime thugs
But our Orange Revolution last winter shows that Ukraine people prevailed
So despite today doubts and difficulties I retain an abiding faith in Europe
I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities and horrors of Ukraine history
I refuse to accept the view that Ukraine is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of communism legacy that we can never see the bright daybreak of peace and true European unity
When the EU citizens ponder Ukraine place in Europe they should look both beyond and more closely at the face they see
They should look beyond the ravaged wastelands that communism inflicted beyond the poverty and beyond the social divisions through which our discarded exleaders sought to prolong their misrule
Instead they should look closely at the face of our president Viktor Yushchenko ravaged by poison during last year election campaign and recall the words of the great Frenchman Andr Malraux for whom he most beautiful faces are those that have been wounded
A Europe of Judges
MAYNOOTH IRELAND  As the Greek financial drama reaches its sorry dnouement another crisis looms for the European project  this time in Germany beginning with a case now before Germany Constitutional Court
Away from the rarefied atmosphere of EU summits which so far have been shaping the Union response to events in Greece other institutional actors have been  and are  shaping the EU system
In particular courts have driven European integration forward as much as politicians have
The powerful European Court of Justice ECJ in particular has frequently been criticized for using European law to disguise an integrationist agenda
Without the ECJ doctrines of irect effect and rimacy and without national courts that are willing to enforce these doctrines in their own jurisdictions the EU most likely would not have attained the level of integration that it has
National courts may consider the effects of European integration on their constitutional and democratic institutions affirming or rejecting the integration that has already taken place or setting limits to supranational arrangements that might further impinge on national sovereignty
This is significant because in May  a group of prominent German economists led by Joachim Starbatty commenced litigation before the German Constitutional Court in which they argued that the EU assistance to Greece and Europe new financial rescue fund violated Article  the EU treaty socalled o bailout clause
The Court will begin hearing the case on July 
Germany Constitutional Court has been among the most prominent in declaring what it considers to be the appropriate limits to EU integration consistent with the country Basic Law constitution
In a number of landmark judgments the Court has expressed skepticism about any move toward a federal EU
In  when ruling on the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty the judges expressed clear reservations about the direction of the European integration process
Their main argument was that the shortcomings of EUlevel democratic practices required the German Bundestag to retain a substantial number of policy competences
For the same reason the competence to decide upon the further allocation of competences had to remain a prerogative of the German state and could not be transferred to the EU
Crucially the Court also asserted its authority to invalidate European laws if found by the judges to lack a basis in the European treaties
In another landmark ruling in June  the Court made Germany ratification of the Lisbon Treaty conditional upon the passage of new legislation giving the Bundestag enhanced powers of scrutiny over European affairs
The Court relied on the same constitutional doctrines and conceptions of sovereignty elaborated in its Maastricht judgment
Now the court in Karlsruhe will have to determine whether the EU recently agreed European Stability Mechanism ESM is consistent with the Basic Law
The risk that the judges could rule the ESM illegal played no small part in efforts made in recent months by Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Nicolas Sarkozy to bind the EU to a revised and more intrusive economic governance framework effected through an amendment to the existing treaties
The debate on sovereignty in Germany and other EU member states has been reignited not just by the debt crisis but also by a string of controversial rulings by the ECJ most notably the Court interpretation of the freedoms of establishment and service delivery articulated in its Viking Laval and Ruffert decisions
The discontent within Germany with the cumulative impact of these decisions has been expressed publicly by some of the country most trusted public representatives
In September  for example former President Roman Herzog published a polemic entitled top the ECJ
He accused the Luxembourg judges of grabbing evergreater competences at the expense of the member states and urged the Constitutional Court to invalidate several controversial ECJ rulings
Herzog broadside resonated across Europe where for some time there has been considerable disquiet about udicial activism and what some see as an irreversible trend toward empowerment of the ECJ and other EU institutions
In many member states the ECJ decisions have produced a backlash especially on the left with trade unions and social movements targeting the Court alleged zeal in siding with business over workers interests
Such arguments were deployed successfully during the  referenda on the Constitutional Treaty in France and the Netherlands and in Ireland during the referendum on the Lisbon Treaty
Indeed the threat to the EU legal order does not lie solely with the German Constitutional Court
In Ireland an embattled austeritydriven coalition government might well have no choice but to hold a referendum on the European Stability Mechanism
It is almost certain that Euroskeptic groups will ask the Irish Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of the ESM
The Irish government has stated emphatically that any amendments to the Lisbon Treaty connected to eurozone reforms will not require a referendum
Its reasoning seems to be that the proposed changes fall far short of what the Supreme Court case law demands and that the ESM does not alter the EU essential scope or objectives
If the Irish Supreme Court were to decide that the ESM requires popular consent the EU would be faced with the prospect of yet another Irish referendum on Europe
Thus Ireland might yet play as significant a part as Germany in determining the future of any amendments to the EU constitutional order with each country top court playing as important a role as politicians in shaping Europe future
A Europe of Provinces Not States
As the European Constitutional Convention assembles to debate the fine points of the European Unions future institutions now is the moment to think the unthinkable about where Europe is heading
Or at least to consider perhaps a quite different question where would it be reasonable for the EU to move
Communisms fall saw the appearance of several small states in Europe
Estonia Latvia and Lithuania reemerged from Soviet occupation
Czechoslovakia split into two separate states
Yugoslavia gave way to Slovenia Croatia Bosnia Serbia Macedonia it may perhaps shortly disgorge Kosovo and Montenegro as well
Although the Baltic republics merely reestablished their preWWII independence and Yugoslavias breakup was a bloody affair like so many other wars of independence there is something tantalizing new in all this as well
In the interwar years the Baltic states were often viewed as impractical artificial creations of the Great Powers
Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia came into existence because their constituent parts were not seen as viable independent states
Why was this
Because  years ago when Wilson Clemenceau and Lloyd George redrew the map of Europe small states were dysfunctional in times of both war and peace
To be viable a state needed to be large enough to defend itself and to constitute a relatively selfcontained economic market
None of this holds true today
With the prospect of entry into the EU national markets matter less
Both EU and NATO membership make war among European member states unthinkable and an attack on even the smallest NATO member would bring a response from all NATO members
Lacking such external threats the ties between say Czechs and Slovaks to say nothing of Serbs and Croats are too weak to warrant a common national level of government
Does this tell us something about the future of Europe as a whole
The difference between Czechoslovakia and Italy or Germany is mostly one of  years
After all wasnt Italy until s a collection of kingdoms and principalities
Wasnt Germanys unification a matter of blood and iron
France and Spain are older but is the marriage of Basques Catalans and Corsicans with their national states that much happier than the former CzechSlovak marriage
Is there really that much reason why the Scots and Welsh should be part of the same national state as the English
Abstract for a second from the idea of French or German or Italian identity patriotism the collective memories of war and carnage that cemented the consciousness of todays linguistic communities and think of this why do Europeans need an intermediate level of government between the common European framework and their local institutions
Why do Piemontese Bavarians or Scots need intermediate national bureaucracies to run their tax policies welfare programs securities laws and the largely useless duplicative armies
Wouldnt life be easier if a common market currency foreign policy army and a few other things were run on a Europewide basis with the rest left to more meaningful local units
It is fashionable to mock the bureaucratic minutia of European regulation
But European regulation is as nothing compared to the mountains of national laws and decrees billions wasted in political patronage and the colossal state machines that eat up  of the economic product of Europes nation states
Could any common European state do worse
Indeed the creation of a European federal government and the elimination of national intermediaries would probably lead to the greatest liberalization of the economy and society as a whole in Europes entire history
Look at America in  creation of the federal government swept away the balkanized system of prerevolutionary colonies ushering in an era of entrepreneurial expansion across the entire American Continent
The simple fact is that Europe as a whole is too diverse to be captured by the economic and political interest groups that now dominate national states
It is only as an
Nations also put Europes constitutional balance out of kilter
Germany and Italy are simply too big as compared to Portugal or Belgium itself a rather questionable amalgam of the Flemish and the Walloons and this creates the types of imbalances reminiscent of the heavy foot of Prussia in the old Bismarckian empire
Could a federal Europe replace todays national identities
Could the French and the British feel as spiritually at home in Europe as they feel in their national states
No but must they
When Europeans think of future institutions the tension is always seen as that between national differences and the common European identity
But what if common European institutions are not viewed through the prism of national institutions
What if the evolution of European consciousness proceeds not by an upward transfer of attachment to supranational institutions but by a
Of course the demise of national states is not imminent but not because they are so deeply rooted in the consciousness of their citizens
Indeed national identities are mostly impoverishing abstractions clichs like race class and other ideological creations
Think of how much more genuine diversity would there be in a united Europe if national states did not squat in the middle
But Europes nation states are not going to disappear for a while because they are
A Europe of Women
PARIS  Are women in Europe on the verge of becoming an engine for political change
In economicdevelopment circles experience and common sense suggest that progress accountability and hard work start with and depend on women
Microcredits for example are much more efficient when women receive and repay them
Perhaps because they bear children and must find the means to feed them women are now perceived as the best and most determined gents of change
That seems to be as true now of European politics as it has been of economics in parts of Africa and Asia
The results of Italy recent municipal elections could be a signal of an incipient electoral dynamic it was women who voted Silvio Berlusconi party out of power in Milan a city that he has long controlled and the original seat of his power
No direct link exists between that result and the dramatic Dominique StraussKahn scandal in New York but in the immediate aftermath of DSK arrest Italian women and young voters decisively mobilized to defeat Berlusconi party led in Milan ironically by a woman
These voters could no longer stand the combination of machismo and vulgarity that had once served so well the man Italian humorists now call erlusKahn
When Berlusconi first came to power  years ago he had the support of a majority of women
They were not discouraged by his ambivalent perception of them by turns celebrating their traditional domesticity and glorifying their sexual objectification
But Italian society has changed most women are now working and they are no longer willing to accept Belusconi anachronistic and outrageous chauvinism
Italian men may pity the aging isolated leader who looks increasingly like his wax effigy at Madame Tussaud
But Italian women indeed women everywhere it seems feel only anger and humiliation over a man so obsessed with himself his various criminal trials and his vulgar pleasures that he appears to them to have no purpose left except to remain in power as long as possible
Women of course are not alone in their opposition to Berlusconi but they made the difference in Milan
They are the incarnation of modernity animated by a yearning for simple dignity and respect
They are not alone in the vanguard of a new Europe of women
As Iceland spiraled into bankruptcy owing the irresponsible behavior of its mostly male political and financial elites the people of Iceland decided that only a strong and responsible woman could redress the country problems
So they elected one as President
The depth and gravity of the current economic and social crisis in countries like Greece Portugal and Spain present women with a new opportunity
Confronted with what many of them perceive as the equivalent of an conomic war women are playing an increasingly important role in maintaining their families financial security
And the more widespread this becomes the more women will seek a political role that reflects their economic clout
Of course women changing status may not translate immediately into growing political influence
And the rest of Europe might never follow the example of Scandinavia where gender equality has advanced much further than anywhere else
But such a dynamic does now seem to be in motion
Similarly regardless of the outcome of DSK trial in New York the case might represent a turning point in the treatment of women in Europe
Public and private displays of atavistic machismo one hopes will no longer be considered acceptable
In the Arab world too from Tunis to Cairo young women have played an important role in the revolutionary process
Their appetite for change  understandable given the treatment of women in traditional Muslim societies  appears to be one of the main causes underlying the force of the revolutionary impulse in Tunisia and Egypt
None of this is to argue that omen are a universal force for positive change in Europe and around the world
Consider for example Marine Le Pen the new head of France National Front Elena Ceaucescu the sordid wife of the former Romanian dictator or more recently Tunisian exPresident Zine El Abidine Ben Ali wife Leila Trabelsi who fled to Dubai with  tons of gold plundered from the central bank
The point simply is that with so many people in so many countries demanding farreaching change the politics of gender is very much in play  in Europe and beyond
The main question is whether the growing number of women in politics will deliver the different perspectives and modes of leadership that many voters or protesters now seem to crave
A European Cure for Balkan Depression
VIENNA  European politics is mostly shaped by events and anniversaries
But while events are often unforeseeable anniversaries are not
Five years from now Europe will be reflecting on the th anniversary of the outbreak of World War  which led to a loss of life almost without parallel and set in motion a chain of events that led to the creation of Europe as we now know it
World leaders may have already reserved some days in August  to mark the occasion
It is easy to predict that Sarajevo will be the place where they will meet to look back on Europe savage twentieth century
But how will Sarajevo look in five years
Will it still be the capital of a country whose citizens view the future bleakly and whose politicians have totally lost touch with the electorate
Or is there a hope that European leaders will use the anniversary to announce the successful integration of the remaining Balkan countries into the European Union
A Balkan Monitor survey recently conducted by Gallup Europe gives suggests the state of public opinion in Serbia Montenegro Macedonia Albania Croatia Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo  years on from the fall of the Berlin Wall and a decade after the end of the Kosovo war
The findings seem to indicate that the next five years will be a makeorbreak period for the region future development
While the overwhelming majority of citizens are convinced that further armed conflict in the region is unlikely the public mood  with the exception of Kosovars and Albanians  is pessimistic
The future promises peace without development
Trust in political elites and in national and European institutions has been steadily declining
The majority of citizens have experienced a decline in living standards in the last year and there remains a perception that people have more opportunities outside their own countries
Pessimism about employment is alarmingly high among young people while corruption and government mismanagement are regarded as being widespread
All those who have made it their job to praise the stability in the region should look at these figures
Indeed it is striking that the majority of citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina believe that their leaders are not interested in their country joining the EU
An absolute majority of citizens in each of the surveyed countries are convinced that their country is heading in the wrong direction
Less than one in  Croats whose country could be joining the EU in the near future believes that their country is heading in the right direction
There are now two options for the region one is a hock integration program that takes all of the Western Balkan states into the EU the other is a journey into the unknown
The hope that these countries can muddle through on their own is a dangerous illusion
Stability alone can no longer be the EU only objective in the region
The EU continuing presence as a colonial power in places like Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo could cause even more problems in the future especially if benefits are not forthcoming
In particular a delay in Serbia integration into the EU could bring Titoinspired fantasies to the heart of the country foreign and security policy
Thus demoralization of Balkan society creates a dynamic of its own when the best and the brightest see their future outside of their own countries and where tability is just another name for political and economic stagnation
If European leaders do plan to meet in  in Sarajevo they should act now
The ratification of the Lisbon Treaty allows for an element of visionary realism in European politics as there are no longer any institutional obstacles to the future enlargement of the EU
Today unlike a year ago we know how many states are in the Balkans and the
But it is now or never for the Balkans
Visa liberalization can be a strategic step in the direction of hock integration but if it is not followed by bold political action from the EU it could merely become a repackaging of the
A European Disease
CHICAGO Many intellectuals in the United States and Eastern Europe believe that West European social welfare policies should be a blueprint for action in their own countries
But those policies are financed by high taxes and costly mandates on business that are mainly responsible for the enormous increase in European unemployment during the past decade and a half
This European disease cannot be cured until members of the European Union recognize it as potentially fatal
In the late s unemployment was under  percent in France Germany and most other Western European nations
It is now closer to  percent in France and Germany and perhaps  percent in Spain
The average rate for those under age  exceeds  percent in most members of the European Union
By contrast unemployment in the United States has not increased during the past fifteen years presently is only  percent and is only about  percent for young workers
The United States experience shows that the growth in European unemployment is not due simply to greater competition from the less developed world or to other forces that affected all advanced countries equally
The rapid growth of labor costs throughout Europe appears to have been a principle cause of its explosion in unemployment
More than onethird of Germany and France average labor costs results from social security health unemployment compensation disability and other taxes other European nations have similar shares
Regulations that restrict layoffs and mandate numerous vacation days and other paid leaves raise Europe cost of labor far above the excessive level due to their heavy taxes
Generous leaves for sickness and other reasons had increased Sweden and Germany absenteeism rates to almost  percent compared with  percent to  percent in Japan and the United States
To reduce costs many European companies increasingly resort to temporary workers because they are easy to dismiss and do not qualify for fringe benefits and taxes
In Spain where it is almost impossible to fire workers on the regular payroll about onethird of employees are temporary
Even in France and Germany perhaps  percent or more of workers are temps
Europe underground economy has grown rapidly in part because it provides a way to escape governmentimposed employee costs
Although no reliable figures on this sector exist crude estimates suggest perhaps  percent of all Italian and Spanish workers work underground at least part of the time as do  percent of those in Belgium France Germany and Sweden
When labor is expensive and firing employees is difficult companies are reluctant either to replace departing workers or to expand employment when the economy picks up
This is why it now takes much longer than a decade ago to find a job in Europe if you are a young job seeker a mother returning to work after childbirth or an immigrant
Those out of work for over a year have grown to more than onethird of the unemployed
For the same reasons private employment in the European Union has barely increased during the past two decades The public sector has accounted for almost all the growth in employment
By contrast Japan and the United States private employment has surged while government employment has grown little
The longterm unemployed youths who never had a steady job temporary employees and underground workers have little opportunity to invest in job skills and training
The sharp growth in these categories means that fewer workers are being trained in European economies
This inadequate training makes it still harder for workers to find satisfactory longterm jobs since modern economies demand high levels of skill and knowledge
Teenagers high school dropouts and immigrants frequently find employment in small establishments especially in fastfood chains and other retail sectors
Increasing the minimum wage puts some of them out of work since their productivity is too low to justify the cost to employers
Recent studies of minimum wages in the United States claim no negative effects on employment and perhaps even positive effects but these studies have been shown to be based on deeply flawed evidence
A reanalysis of their evidence as well as other evidence continues to show sizable reductions in employment of teenagers and others with limited skills when minimum wages increase significantly
Yet some Europeans governments in misguided attempts to raise incomes and spending have foolishly increased their minimum wages  the conservative French government this past summer raised the minimum to over  per hour
Even those American economists who believe that a slightly higher minimum for the United States  it is presently  per hour  would not have much effect on employment probably agree that a  per hour minimum would have large effects on the opportunities of teenagers and others with few skills
Sometimes the need for a higher rate of pay is justified by noting that a family cannot live decently on minimum wage earnings
However raising the minimum is not an effective way to reduce poverty since poor families typically get only a small fraction of their income from members whose wages are near the minimum
The French government is also subsidizing the employment in both the private and public sectors of hundreds of thousands of mainly young unqualified workers
However most of these expensive and inefficient subsidies would be unnecessary if the minimum wage were much lower and if French labor markets were much freer
Government regulations and transfer payments not company needs also explain the sharp fall in European laborforce participation rates of men aged  to   from about  percent in the s to under  percent in many European countries now
Realization of eligibility requirements for disability pay and generous Social Security benefits induced many older workers to take early retirement
Why keep working if you can get almost as much income by retiring and collecting pensions from the French German or other governments
It is paradoxical that although older persons are much healthier and living considerably longer than they did fifty years ago government policies have driven most of them out of work into retirement
Since many of the elderly have much to contribute to the economy through their experience and judgment their choice between work and retirement should not be skewed and biased by government mandates and financial incentives
Taxes and death may be inevitable but not the degree of taxation and regulation prevailing in France and other European nations
A large dent will not be made in the disgracefully high unemployment and low employment until European social policies are recognized for what they are A serious disease that badly infects their labor markets
A European New Deal
FLORENCEANN ARBOR  The eurozone has reached a crossroads
European policy prescriptions have proven inadequate and there is no consensus on the right balance of fiscal consolidation and economic stimulus  or on how much fiscal solidarity a functioning monetary union requires
Disagreement over Eurobonds exemplifies the European Union current dilemma
Overstretched sovereign borrowers on the eurozone periphery argue that issuing government securities backed by all eurozone countries is the only way out of their ebt trap
But without common economic governance northern Europeans contend mutualization of debt would encourage freeriding by debtor countries
In fact both sides are right
So in order to neutralize moral hazard northern European countries seek a guarantee that their profligate peripheral neighbors maintain discipline reflected in steps taken toward greater Europewide governance of national fiscal policies
Indeed EU leaders are focusing on more European rules to discipline national governments
But even if fiscal discipline is achieved it will not be enough to fortify the monetary union
Indeed a country fiscal position depends on its broader economic environment and in particular on its trade balance
A monetary union cannot comprise only states running trade surpluses hard times demand costly transfers
Moreover a system that focuses almost exclusively on EU rules imposed on its member countries to guarantee a wellfunctioning monetary union is politically unsustainable
Either national democratic processes will prevail rendering the rules ineffective or the rules will be strictly enforced and the limits that they impose on national political systems risk plunging democracy itself into crisis
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is correct that ore Europe not less is the only solution
But this requires even more than she is willing to concede
In fact the way out of the euro crisis is a New Deal for Europe with governance at its heart
Europe transfer union must give way to a genuine fiscal union which implies EU resources and policies that are sufficient to correct the monetary union inevitable asymmetries
Consider the United States the world most wellknown and arguably most successful currency union
It became an ptimal currency area only in the  when the federal government gained the power to ease asymmetric shocks for example by conducting fiscal transfers
To be sure Europe New Deal would not require a US level of governance
But certain powers are crucial including an effective unemploymentinsurance system meaningful Europewide policies that create positive incentives for national governments and structural transfers from the EU to member states linked to those policies
To accomplish this Europe needs its own resources funded by taxes levied on EUrelated economic activity and bonds guaranteed through the EU budget
The New Deal second crucial ingredient is politics
While European governance will naturally take on more political relevance as politics follows power and money Europe leaders must take an active role
Political decisions and institutional changes must be salient to voters in Europewide elections
To this end European parliamentary elections must be augmented by a genuine electoral competition for President of the European Commission
This would give the position real political capital provide legitimacy to EU spending and catalyze a fundamental shift in citizens perceptions of integration
Rather than arguing for or against Europe political contestants would debate contrasting visions of Europe
To reach that point however Europeans must acknowledge that their house is on fire
If the EU member countries do not act together to put it out it will only spread  consuming the common currency and threatening the European project of ver closer union
Only a true political and fiscal union can legitimate the level of interdependence and solidarity that a monetary union requires
European leaders when told that what is needed is also politically impossible should remember that in the past saving Europe required making the impossible possible
Indeed they should summon the spirit of Jean Monnet an EU founding father who saw opportunity in every crisis
Just as Monnet forged ahead in the dire conditions of postwar Europe ravaged economies and societies so today leaders should take advantage of the current crisis to establish a New Deal for Europe  and a new vision of Europe future
A European Opening for the Arab World
BERLIN  The people of Tunisia and Egypt have shown that democracy in Arab countries need not come at the barrel of a Western gun
But while the drive for democratic change has been local and authentic there is no guarantee of a successful political transition democratically elected governments will have to address the same social and economic problems that contributed to the old regimes fall  not least the need to create jobs and opportunities for the young
This will be impossible without external support
Given the myriad links between the European Union countries and the Mediterranean southern rim Europe must not miss this opportunity
So far the EU has offered to support democratization in Tunisia and Egypt by helping to organize free and fair elections establish political parties and reform the police courts and local administrations
But such politicaladministrative support is not enough
Nor is a Marshall Plantype program of grand investments sufficient
This is not to discount the need for such projects the renewableenergy sector in particular holds enormous opportunities for cooperation
Europe needs clean energy and will not be able to produce enough on its own territory
The countries of North Africa also need energy  particularly more electricity and new networks to support urban and industrial development
Indeed the availability of uninterrupted electricity often makes the difference between say a shoemaker workshop and a shoe factory
And these countries have the most suitable environment for solar thermal power production
According to some optimistic studies solar thermal power plants and wind farms in North Africa could not only boost economic growth there but also provide more than  of Europe electricity by 
Obviously cooperation agreements and private investment in this sector should be encouraged
The problem is that such longterm investments bring results only in the medium and long term
They do not address today social or economic problems nor do they signal a new societyoriented approach by Europe towards its Mediterranean neighbors
New EU programs should mainly aim at strengthening the specific capacities of Tunisia Egypt and others and seek opportunities that benefit both sides of the Mediterranean
Catherine Ashton the EU vicepresident and high representative for foreign affairs and security policy has proposed a Partnership for Democracy and Shared Prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean which contains a host of useful measures including facilitation of visas for students academics and business people
But to make this scheme more concrete I would suggest augmenting it with a act for labor and skills between the EU and the Arab countries that choose a path to democratic transformation
Europe while afraid of illegal migration needs foreign labor for its own demographic reasons  not least young engineers technical staff doctors and healthcare workers
Tunisia Egypt and the other Southern Mediterranean countries have an abundance of young people with degrees and no jobs who often also need to acquire practical skills
This is most urgent for the Arab world baby boomers  those between  and 
The next generation is already smaller
As a practical step the EU and its member states should offer  visas and work permits annually for graduates from participating Mediterranean countries
Such a program would include first a traineeship in European firms followed by the opportunity to work in Europe for  years
At the end of that period participants would receive soft businessstartup loans from European development banks to create employment in their countries of origin
Designed for at least a year period such a program would be a strong signal in itself
It would show young people from Tunisia Egypt and other transformation countries that there are other options than getting on a boat to the Italian island of Lampedusa
It would be a real incentive to finish one university education indeed it should be augmented by investment in vocational schools technical highschools and universities in North Africa and the Middle East
Once implemented the labor pact would help to change attitudes towards Arab immigrants in Europe  and Europe image in the Southern Mediterranean
It would likely create lasting ties between people and economies
And it would address real needs in the Southern Mediterranean countries  improving professional skills reducing the pressure on the local labor market creating businesses and jobs  as well as in Europe
Some warn against any programs for emporary or ircular migration
To be sure some who benefit would want to stay
But while this urden might in fact benefit aging European countries the risk is relatively low in the first place Arab countries entering such a pact would be better governed than they were under the previous regimes
If they become consolidated democracies as hoped wouldbe entrepreneurs could stop worrying so much about official corruption
And startup loans from Europe would make it much easier to seek one fortune back home
Such an approach needs to be communicated both to the European public and to the people of Tunisia Egypt and other Arab countries
It would reverse the pattern whereby Europe relies on repressive regimes to supply it with oil and gas and guard its borders against migrants
At long last these countries demographic wealth would be used to meet their development needs
Closing Europe Strategy Gap
MADRID  The ongoing crisis in Ukraine has been a hot topic of analysis for almost a year
But one question has largely escaped thorough examination what Russia annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine indicates about the European Union foreign policy
During the early stages of the crisis Germany which had bet heavily on Russia modernization was averse to taking any consequential action
But as the crisis deepened German Chancellor Angela Merkel worked to persuade her European counterparts to implement a broad and biting sanctions regime
This certainly was a step in the right direction but it did nothing to address the foreignpolicy failings that helped spark the Ukrainian crisis and continue to undermine Europe response  namely the EU misguided Neighborhood Policy ENP and its muddled approach to energy
On both of these fronts the EU lack of strategic vision has created the impression that Europe is repeatedly being outmaneuvered by Russian President Vladimir Putin
It increasingly appears that Ukraine is becoming locked in a rozen conflict  Russia foreignpolicy specialty
Indeed the situation in Ukraine represents a tactical victory for Russia with the fragile but enduring ceasefire  and accompanying legislation that grants Donetsk and Luhansk considerable political autonomy  allowing Russia to entrench the conflict near the EU border
Moreover the delayed implementation of key elements of the EU association agreement with Ukraine is clear evidence that at the moment Russia dictates the terms of EUUkrainian engagement
In Europe the Kremlin has been able to pursue a successful divideandrule strategy particularly in view of Hungary decision to suspend gas flows to Ukraine
Prime Minister Viktor Orbn government whose behavior in recent years has been at odds with the EU criteria for democracy now openly approves of authoritarian regimes  and Putin in particular  with serious potential consequences for European unity
Nonetheless the timing of the current ceasefire which coincides with the installation of a new EU Commission is advantageous as is Putin shortsighted emphasis on tactical victories
EU leaders should take advantage of the break in the fighting to stop reacting and start anticipating
With a longterm strategic vision the EU could overwhelm and ultimately undermine Putin shortterm successes
Such a vision must include a reconceptualization of the ENP
The program mission  to help guide the political social and economic transitions of neighboring states  is not inherently problematic the problem lies in the way that the mission has been interpreted and pursued
For starters the ENP assumes that all of the EU neighbors both in the south and in the east ultimately want to realize European values and structures in their own countries
In other words the ENP does not account for the developmental cultural and aspirational differences among the EU partner countries
The ENP suffers operationally from its excessively technical approach and lack of strategic vision
For example before the Ukraine crisis the European Commission was so focused on negotiating the technical features of the association agreement that it did not consider adequately the potential fallout of the process  such as say a response from Russia
To be sure the EU recognized its need for a coherent strategy and attempted to resolve it by establishing the European External Action Service and the position of High Representative for Foreign Affairs
But the EEAS ended up in a turf war with the European Commission and outgoing High Representative Catherine Ashton did little to ease the tension owing to her unwillingness to involve herself in intraEU disagreements
It is telling that Ashton has made progress exclusively in areas defined by ample consensus such as the negotiations on Iran nuclear program and the pact between Kosovo and Serbia
Further eroding Europe effectiveness is its fragmented approach to securing energy supplies
With every country largely controlling its own energy policy Europe energy market has become inefficient and excessively dependent on Russian supplies
To the extent that there has been an EUwide energy strategy it has related to renewables rather than the intersection of geopolitics and energy security
But there is reason for hope
The new Commission which its president Jean Claude Juncker has restructured significantly could provide Europe with the strategic leadership it so badly needs
In fact Juncker has already expressed a desire to integrate incoming High Representative Federica Mogherini into the Commission policy program
The new structure  which tasks Mogherini with guiding and coordinating the work of multiple commissioners including those responsible for trade the ENP and climate and energy  should strengthen the coherence and direction of EU policies particularly after Mogherini completes her European Councilmandated assessment of the global strategic landscape
But a restructured Commission is not enough to ensure a reset of Europe foreignpolicy strategy
For that to happen Mogherini must assert herself as a leader backed by Juncker and the new European Council president Donald Tusk
And most important all EU member states must recommit themselves to cooperation
The Ukrainian people have demonstrated the power of Europe values
Indeed Europe has a large set of tools at its disposal it just needs to figure out how to use them
If it can it will be better able to respond not only to the Russian challenge but also to many of the other challenges that characterize today rapidly shifting global environment
A Failed Global Recovery
NEW HAVEN  The global economy is in the midst of its second growth scare in less than two years
Get used to it
In a postcrisis world these are the footprints of a failed recovery
The reason is simple
The typical business cycle has a natural cushioning mechanism that wards off unexpected blows
The deeper the downturn the more powerful the snapback and the greater the cumulative forces of selfsustaining revival
Vigorous Vshaped rebounds have a builtin resilience that allows them to shrug off shocks relatively easily
But a postcrisis recovery is a very different animal
As Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff have shown in their book This Time is Different over the long sweep of history postcrisis recoveries in output and employment tend to be decidedly subpar
Such weak recoveries by definition lack the cushion of Vshaped rebounds
Consequently external shocks quickly expose their vulnerability
If the shocks are sharp enough  and if they hit a weakened global economy that is approaching its tall speed of around  annual growth  the relapse could turn into the dreaded doubledip recession
That is the risk today
There can be no mistaking the decidedly subpar character of the current global recovery
Superficially the numbers look strong world GDP rebounded by  in  and is expected to rise another  in  according to the International Monetary Fund
But because these gains follow the massive contraction that occurred during the Great Recession of  they are a far cry from the trajectory of a classic Vshaped recovery
Indeed if the IMF latest forecast proves correct global GDP at the end of  will still be about  percentage points below the level that would have been reached had the world remained on its longerterm  annualgrowth path
Even if the global economy holds at a  cruise speed  a big f in my view  it will remain below its trendline potential for over eight years in a row through 
This protracted lobal output gap underscores the absence of a cushion in today world economy as well as its heightened sensitivity to shocks
And there have certainly been numerous such blows in recent months  from Europe sovereigndebt crisis and Japan natural disasters to sharply higher oil prices and another setback in the US housing recovery
While none of these shocks appears to have been severe enough to have derailed the current global recovery the combined effect is worrisome especially in a stillweakened postcrisis world
Most pundits dismiss the possibility of a doubledip recession
Labeling the current slowdown a temporary oft patch they pin their optimism on the inevitable rebound that follows any shock
For example a boost is expected from Japan reconstruction and supplychain resumption
Another assist may come from America recent move to tap its strategic petroleum reserves in an effort to push oil prices lower
But in the aftermath of the worst crisis and recession of modern times  when shocks can push an already weakened global economy to its tipping point a lot faster than would be the case under a stronger growth scenario  the escape velocity of selfsustaining recovery is much harder to achieve
The soft patch may be closer to a quagmire
This conclusion should not be lost on highflying emergingmarket economies especially in Asia  currently the world fastestgrowing region and the leader of what many now call a twospeed world
Yet with exports still close to a record  of panregional GDP Asia can hardly afford to take external shocks lightly  especially if they hit an already weakened baseline growth trajectory in the postcrisis developed world
The recent slowdown in Chinese industrial activity underscores this very risk
Policymakers are ill prepared to cope with a steady stream of growth scares
They continue to favor strategies that are better suited to combating crisis than to promoting postcrisis healing
That is certainly true of the United States
While the US Federal Reserve Board first round of quantitative easing was effective in ending a wrenching crisis the second round has done little to sustain meaningful recovery in the labor market and the real economy
America zombie consumers need to repair their damaged balance sheets and US workers need to align new skills with new jobs
Openended liquidity injections accomplish neither
European authorities are caught up in a similar mindset
Mistaking a solvency problem for a liquidity shortfall Europe has become hooked on the drip feed of bailouts
However this works only if countries like Greece grow their way out of a debt trap or abrogate their deeply entrenched social contracts
The odds on either are exceedingly poor
The likelihood of recurring growth scares for the next several years implies little hope for new and creative approaches to postcrisis monetary and fiscal policies
Driven by shortterm electoral horizons policymakers repeatedly seek a quick fix  another bailout or one more liquidity injection
Yet in the aftermath of a balancesheet recession in the US and in the midst of a debt trap in Europe that approach is doomed to failure
Liquidity injections and bailouts serve only one purpose  to buy time
Yet time is not the answer for economies desperately in need of the structural repairs of fiscal consolidation privatesector deleveraging labormarket reforms or improved competitiveness
Nor does time cushion anemic postcrisis recoveries from the inevitable next shock
It hard to know when the next shock will hit or what form it will take otherwise it wouldn be a shock
But as night follows day such a disruption is inevitable
With policymakers reluctant to focus on the imperatives of structural healing the result will be yet another growth scare  or worse
A failed recovery underscores the risks of an increasingly treacherous endgame in today postcrisis world
A Fair Deal for Africa Resources
WINDHOEK  Namibia is a resourcebased economy that has embarked on an ambitious development program
Our vision is to turn Namibia into a knowledgebased diversified economy by 
One of the major principles upon which this vision is based is the idea of artnerships  a major prerequisite for the achievement of dynamic efficient and sustainable development
Partnerships between governments and foreign investors are at the core of the sound management of natural resources
But such partnerships can be taken for granted on a continent where the quest for natural resources has fueled decades of violent conflict
Genuine partnership is difficult to achieve when resourcerich countries view foreign mining and drilling companies only as adversaries seeking unfair and inequitable contracting agreements
From the perspective of companies partnership is unattractive when they are forced to incur large losses owing to project disruptions and contract renegotiations
By contrast partnerships are strengthened if companies and governments recognize their shared interest in durable mutually beneficial contracts that ensure stable revenue streams from projects
This requires a framework that takes into account among other things developmental possibilities environmental concerns labor conditions and community interests and that is adaptable to changing circumstances
For governments contracts are more likely to be durable if they are negotiated in a way that enables countries to receive fair and predictable longterm revenues
For developing countries this source of income can be substantial over several decades and is needed by governments for investment in infrastructure health care education etc
On the other hand poorly conceived and negotiated contracts not only prevent countries from enjoying the full longterm benefits of their natural resources but also help to entrench poverty corruption and even conflict particularly when governance systems are inadequate
For companies contracts are more likely to be durable if they are negotiated in a way that continuously rewards firms for risky and capitalintensive investment in terms of the net present value of their earnings
Companies also want of course contracts that won be repudiated by the next government
Indeed poorly negotiated contracts are a recipe for adverse business outcomes such as reduced security of mining titles increased likelihood of operational disruptions from targeted civil protests and greater risk of revisions to tax and other conditions
Many governments in Africa simply don have the capacity to negotiate complex contracts that require a wide range of indepth knowledge of law finance geology economic modeling etc while firms typically do
As a result the contracts that are negotiated often do not meet the criteria described above  to the disadvantage not only of governments but also of firms interested in durable contracts
In the absence of conditions for equitable negotiations governments often deem the resulting contracts unfair  thus dooming them to be breached at some point
In these circumstances there is an urgent need for a facility that allows governments of poor countries to negotiate on a par with foreign investors to reach contracts that are as fair as possible under the given circumstances
The outcome of such negotiations can be expected to be  and to be perceived to be  more balanced more transparent more stable and therefore more sustainable
The time has come to establish such a facility  in the interest of a mutually beneficial partnership between governments and foreign investors
A Fair Deal for Turkey
Turkey has been given what looks like an ultimatum from the EU Commission open your ports for ships from Cyprus within a month or you may risk a halt to the EU accession talks now underway
At the same time the Commission latest report on Turkey progress toward accession notes that political reforms have slowed down further calling into question the country future EU membership
The Commission progress report will be dealt with by the European Council next month
At that meeting European leaders should ask themselves the following questions Has the EU given Turkey a fair deal in the case of Cyprus
Has the EU behavior been consistent in supporting political reform in Turkey
What are the EU longterm interests visvis Turkey
If the answers to the first two questions are o  as I believe they are  the third question becomes vitally important
True Turkey has closed its ports to ships from Greek Cyprus and this is a violation of agreements
But it is also true that the northern Turkish part of Cyprus is denied access to free trade and other benefits from EUmembership
This is because Cyprus remains a divided island
It was assumed that Cyprus should be united when the country joined the EU in 
A United Nations plan for unification was accepted by the Turkish part
But the Greek Cypriots voted against the plan because their leaders did not live up to the implicit deal with the EU to support it
Nevertheless Cyprus became an EU member  but only the Greek part
This was clearly a mistake because it made the EU part of the conflict
It gave Greek Cypriot leaders the possibility of blocking progress in negotiations between the EU and Turkey
So how can Turkey under these conditions maintain confidence in the EU fairness
Political and legal reforms in Turkey in recent years have been remarkably farreaching for they have clearly been spurred by Turks wish to move closer to the EU
But Turkish public support for EU membership has fallen dramatically as Turks have grown to feel that they are not being given a fair deal
This has given new strength to those who want Turkey to develop in another direction towards a more Islamic society instead of a modern secular state
Therefore the recent lack of progress in Turkey reform process can to a large extent be explained by the EU behavior
This leaves us with the third question what kind of Turkey does the EU want
There should be no doubt about the answer it is clearly in the EU interest to see Turkey democracy and economy continue to strengthen
More than  years ago it was promised that once Turkey lives up to the preconditions for membership it will be welcome in the EU
It is high time that European leaders take this promise seriously
It is a sad fact that a large majority of voters in the EU are against Turkish membership
But they are reacting to the current situation
When they are asked if they would like a reformed Turkey as a partner  a Turkey that lives up fully to the conditions for membership described in the Copenhagen Criteria democracy rule of law respect for human rights and an effective market economy  many more are inclined to say yes
European leaders must therefore take up two challenges
First they should say clearly to their own voters that the EU must live up to its promises to Turkey and that this is in the larger interest of all Europeans
Second they should give Turkey a fair deal in the negotiations
The first litmus test on European leadership concerns the practical problem of access to harbors
Here the Finns who chair the EU right now have taken an initiative to implement a pragmatic solution that takes into consideration both sides in the conflict
The Finnish initiative should be given strong support from all European leaders
At the same time a new effort should be made to bring life to the UN proposals regarding Cyprus
If this means putting pressure on some actors within the EU own ranks so be it
A Fair Deal on Climate Change
The agreement on climate change reached at Heiligendamm by the G leaders merely sets the stage for the real debate to come how will we divide up the diminishing capacity of the atmosphere to absorb our greenhouse gases
The G leaders agreed to seek ubstantial cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and to give erious consideration to the goal of halving such emissions by   an outcome hailed as a triumph by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Yet the agreement commits no one to any specific targets least of all the United States whose president George W Bush will no longer be in office in  when the tough decisions have to be made
One could reasonably ask why anyone thinks such a vague agreement is any kind of advance at all
At the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in   countries including the US China India and all the European nations signed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change thereby agreeing to stabilize greenhouse gases t a low enough level to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system
Fifteen years later no country has done that
US per capita greenhouse gas emissions already the highest of any major nation when Bush took office have continued to rise
In March a leaked Bush administration report showed that US emissions were expected to rise almost as fast over the next decade as they did during the previous decade
Now we have yet another agreement to do what these same nations said they would do  years ago
That a triumph
If Bush or his successor wants to ensure that the next round of talks fails that will be easy enough
In justifying his refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol Bush has always referred to the fact that it did not commit China and India to mandatory emission limits
Now in response to suggestions by Bush and other G leaders that the larger developing nations must be part of the solution to climate change Ma Kai the head of China National Development and Reform Commission has said that China will not commit to any quantified emissions reduction targets
Likewise the spokesman of India foreign minister Navtej Sarna has said that his country would reject such mandatory restrictions
Are China and India being unreasonable
Their leaders have consistently pointed out that our current problems are the result of the gases emitted by the industrialized nations over the past century
That is true most of those gases are still in the atmosphere and without them the problem would not be nearly as urgent as it now is
China and India claim the right to proceed with industrialization and development as the developed nations did unhampered by limits on their greenhouse gas emissions
China India and other developing nations have a point  or rather three points
First if we apply the principle ou broke it you fix it then the developed nations have to take responsibility for our roken atmosphere which can no longer absorb more greenhouse gases without the world climate changing
Second even if we wipe the slate clean and forget about who caused the problem it remains true that the typical US resident is responsible for about six times more greenhouse gas emissions than the typical Chinese and as much as  times more than the average Indian
Third the richer nations are better able than less welloff nations to absorb the costs of fixing the problem without causing serious harm to their populations
But it is also true that if China and India continue to increase their output of greenhouse gases they will eventually undo all the good that would be achieved by deep emissions cuts in the industrialized nations
This year or next China will overtake the US as the world biggest greenhouse gas emitter  on a national rather than a per capita basis of course
In  years according to Fatih Birol chief economist at the International Energy Agency China emissions could be double those of the US Europe and Japan combined
But there is a solution that is both fair and practical
Establish the total amount of greenhouse gases that we can allow to be emitted without causing the earth average temperature to rise more than two degrees Celsius  degrees Fahrenheit the point beyond which climate change could become extremely dangerous
Divide that total by the world population thus calculating what each person share of the total is
Allocate to each country a greenhouse gas emissions quota equal to the country population multiplied by the per person share
Finally allow countries that need a higher quota to buy it from those that emit less than their quota
The fairness of giving every person on earth an equal share of the atmosphere capacity to absorb our greenhouse gas emissions is difficult to deny
Why should anyone have a greater entitlement than others to use the earth atmosphere
But in addition to being fair this scheme also has practical benefits
It would give developing nations a strong incentive to accept mandatory quotas because if they can keep their per capita emissions low they will have excess emissions rights to sell to the industrialized nations
The rich countries will benefit too because they will be able to choose their preferred mix of reducing emissions and buying up emissions rights from developing nations
A Farewell to Glorious War
In recent days Italy government fell after losing a parliamentary vote on the country troop deployment in Afghanistan while Britain and Denmark announced that they are to begin withdrawing their troops from Iraq
Whereas the Bush administration is deploying an additional  American soldiers in Iraq and is pushing for more allied troops in Afghanistan America allies are rejecting its Middle East policy
They are increasingly convinced that ictory will be elusive in any asymmetric conflict between states however powerful and religiously driven armed insurgents
Donald Rumsfeld dogma of military ransformation  the technological upgrading of an army capacity to enable decisive victory with fewer troops  failed resoundingly in Iraq
Nor could Israel with its overwhelming technological advantage defeat Hezbollah in Lebanon
More rockets and missiles fell on northern Israel in  days than hit Britain during all of World War II
So the Israelis now must reckon with an entirely new phenomenon an asymmetric entity Hezbollah with nationstate firepower
So the fierce debate over whether to increase the size of American ground forces in Iraq is beside the point
Neither the Soviet experience in Afghanistan in the  nor NATO today vindicates the claim that troop numbers are what matter most on the modern battlefield
When geostrategic military front lines are nonexistent as in Kosovo Afghanistan and Iraq mass no longer equals victory
The great military thinker Carl von Clausewitz notion of ecisive battles as the enter of gravity of war is simply irrelevant to conflicts that have no visible enter of gravity
Indeed while wars from the time of Hannibal defeat of the Romans in  BC to the Gulf War of  had this center of gravity with a massive concentration of force capable of bringing an enemy to its knees such industrial interstate wars have now become an historical anachronism
Most states nowadays lie within borders that are widely accepted as legitimate and they increasingly abide by international norms of behavior in times of war
In fact the obligation of states to abide by humanitarian rules of conduct while their enemies are free to barbarize warfare is what makes asymmetric wars especially insoluble
Moreover in an era of global media and international war crimes courts the criteria for states use of military force have become more complex than ever
Interstate combat may still occur where strategic front lines can be found such as Israel border with Syria India border with Pakistan and the border dividing the two Koreas
In such cases war as the Egyptians showed in  might still serve as an avenue to resolving a conflict
The Syrians might be tempted to launch an offensive against Israel with the objective of breaking the deadlock over the future of the Golan Heights
However in the case of Kashmir the asymmetric conflict currently fought by proxies and terrorist groups might not degenerate into allout war precisely because India and Pakistan have mutual nuclear deterrence
This changing nature of the battlefield essentially means that war as a conclusive event in an international conflict has become obsolete
The facile Clausewitzian wisdom that military action ultimately leads to a political solution is no longer convincing
ictory cannot bring peace simply because there will always be a war after the war
Thus for example the conventional war in Kosovo lasted for two months only to usher in a sixyear asymmetric conflict
Likewise America threeweek hock and awe campaign in Iraq in  ended in ictory but opened the gates of hell for occupiers and ordinary Iraqis alike
And six months after the merciless pounding of southern Lebanon Hezbollah is as strong as it was before
Nor does the return of the Taliban in Afghanistan six years after their overthrow now seen too farfetched
It is during the war after the war that the occupier inferiority is revealed with constant reinforcements increasing the number of targets for the insurgents far more quickly than the occupier can adapt to the changing battlefield
The insurgents in Iraq as the British admit were able in just three years to cope with their enemies technological superiority in a way that the IRA in Northern Ireland was unable to do in  years
The Iraq war and Israel wars with Hamas and Hezbollah show the limits of what military power can achieve as well as vindicate diplomacy and conflict resolution
When it comes to tackling complex political and cultural conflicts forging international and regional alliances around a legitimate objective is more important than sheer military capacity
That said it would be dangerously nave to believe that the exercise of power and the capacity to intimidate are unnecessary
But the objectives of the use of force need to be linked to the recognition that in today asymmetric conflicts victory is no longer achieved on the battlefield
Only betterinformed foreign policies that can address the genuine anxieties of civilizations in crisis will yield more sustainable results
A Farewell to Nuclear Arms
MOSCOW  Twentyfive years ago this month I sat across from Ronald Reagan in Reykjavik Iceland to negotiate a deal that would have reduced and could have ultimately eliminated by  the fearsome arsenals of nuclear weapons held by the United States and the Soviet Union
For all our differences Reagan and I shared the strong conviction that civilized countries should not make such barbaric weapons the linchpin of their security
Even though we failed to achieve our highest aspirations in Reykjavik the summit was nonetheless in the words of my former counterpart  major turning point in the quest for a safer and secure world
The next few years may well determine if our shared dream of ridding the world of nuclear weapons will ever be realized
Critics present nuclear disarmament as unrealistic at best and a risky utopian dream at worst
They point to the Cold War ong peace as proof that nuclear deterrence is the only means of staving off a major war
As someone who has commanded these weapons I strongly disagree
Nuclear deterrence has always been a hard and brittle guarantor of peace
By failing to propose a compelling plan for nuclear disarmament the US Russia and the remaining nuclear powers are promoting through inaction a future in which nuclear weapons will inevitably be used
That catastrophe must be forestalled
As I along with George P Shultz William J Perry Henry A Kissinger Sam Nunn and others pointed out five years ago nuclear deterrence becomes less reliable and more risky as the number of nucleararmed states increases
Barring preemptive war which has proven counterproductive or effective sanctions which have thus far proven insufficient only sincere steps toward nuclear disarmament can furnish the mutual security needed to forge tough compromises on arms control and nonproliferation matters
The trust and understanding built at Reykjavik paved the way for two historic treaties
The  IntermediateRange Nuclear Forces INF Treaty destroyed the feared quickstrike missiles then threatening Europe peace
And in  the first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty START I cut the bloated US and Soviet nuclear arsenals by  over a decade
But prospects for progress on arms control and nonproliferation are darkening in the absence of a credible push for nuclear disarmament
I learned during those two long days in Reykjavik that disarmament talks could be as constructive as they are arduous
By linking an array of interrelated matters Reagan and I built the trust and understanding needed to moderate a nucleararms race of which we had lost control
In retrospect the Cold War end heralded the coming of a messier arrangement of global power and persuasion
The nuclear powers should adhere to the requirements of the  NonProliferation Treaty and resume ood faith negotiations for disarmament
This would augment the diplomatic and moral capital available to diplomats as they strive to restrain nuclear proliferation in a world where more countries than ever have the wherewithal to construct a nuclear bomb
Only a serious program of universal nuclear disarmament can provide the reassurance and the credibility needed to build a global consensus that nuclear deterrence is a dead doctrine
We can no longer afford politically or financially the discriminatory nature of the current system of nuclear aves and avenots
Reykjavik proved that boldness is rewarded
Conditions were far from favorable for a disarmament deal in 
Before I became Soviet leader in  relations between the Cold War superpowers had hit rock bottom
Reagan and I were nonetheless able to create a reservoir of constructive spirit through constant outreach and facetoface interaction
What seem to be lacking today are leaders with the boldness and vision to build the trust needed to reintroduce nuclear disarmament as the centerpiece of a peaceful global order
Economic constraints and the Chernobyl disaster helped spur us to action
Why has the Great Recession and the disastrous meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi in Japan not elicited a similar response today
A first step would be for the US finally to ratify the  Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty CTBT
President Barack Obama has endorsed this treaty as a vital instrument to discourage proliferation and avert nuclear war
It time for Obama to make good on commitments he made in Prague in  take up Reagan mantle as Great Communicator and persuade the US Senate to formalize America adherence to the CTBT
This would compel the remaining holdouts  China Egypt India Indonesia Iran Israel North Korea and Pakistan  to reconsider the CTBT as well
That would bring us closer to a global ban on nuclear tests in any environment  the atmosphere undersea in outer space or underground
A second necessary step is for the US and Russia to follow up on the New START agreement and begin deeper weapons cuts especially tactical and reserve weapons which serve no purpose waste funds and threaten security
This step must be related to limits on missile defense one of the key issues that undermined the Reykjavik summit
A fissile material cutoff treaty FMCT long stalled in multilateral talks in Geneva and a successful second Nuclear Security Summit next year in Seoul will help secure dangerous nuclear materials
This will also require that the  Global Partnership dedicated to securing and eliminating all weapons of mass destruction  nuclear chemical and biological  is renewed and expanded when it convenes next year in the US
Our world remains too militarized
In today economic climate nuclear weapons have become loathsome money pits
If as seems likely economic troubles continue the US Russia and other nuclear powers should seize the moment to launch multilateral arms reductions through new or existing channels such as the UN Conference on Disarmament
These deliberations would yield greater security for less money
But the buildup of conventional military forces  driven in large part by the enormous military might deployed globally by the US  must be addressed as well
As we engage in furthering our Conventional Forces in Europe CFE agreement we should seriously consider reducing the burden of military budgets and forces globally
US President John F Kennedy once warned that very man woman and child lives under a nuclear sword of Damocles hanging by the slenderest of threads capable of being cut at any moment
For more than  years humanity has warily eyed that lethal pendulum while statesmen debated how to mend its fraying cords
The example of Reykjavik should remind us that palliative measures are not enough
Our efforts  years ago can be vindicated only when the Bomb ends up beside the slave trader manacles and the Great War mustard gas in the museum of bygone savagery

A Field Guide to Israeli Hawks
Prime Minister Ariel Sharons announcement that he plans to dismantle Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip as well as some settlements in the West Bank has shocked and caught people off guard both in Israel and around the world
Many denounced Sharons plan as a trick
But that surprise was wrongheaded from the start
Despite the way it often looks to outsiders debates in Israel about the future of the occupied territories have never been confined to hawks and doves
Like everything in Israel the process is more complicated especially where the hawks are concerned
Basically there are two species of Israeli hawks call one kind ideological and the other strategic
Ideological hawks view the occupied territories as an integral part of the historical Land of Israel the homeland of the Jewish people
For them the territories are part of the Jewish patrimony which is why they insist on referring to the West Bank by its Hebrew historical appellation  Judea and Samaria
Not all ideological hawks are religious although those who are base their claim on divine promises and prophecies
But many ideological hawks are secular nationalists and their jargon is similar to that of typical Central and Eastern European nationalists
Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir belonged to that category
Ideological hawks usually come from the NationalReligious Party and from members of the Likud
They are inspired by the nationalist ideology connected with Vladimir Jabotinsky who founded Revisionist Zionism as a challenge to the more moderate version espoused by Israels Founding Fathers like Chaim Weizmann and David BenGurion
Then there are the strategic hawks
For them given Israels narrow and vulnerable geographic shape and continuing Arab enmity controlling the West Bank and Gaza is not an ideological imperative but is driven by security considerations
For them Jewish settlements in the territories are not a return to historical lands but security outposts aimed at preventing  or repelling from a better strategic position  an attack on the Israeli heartland
They may be right or wrong in this assessment but it is not an ideological one
Ariel Sharon who comes from a military background  he grew up in a social milieu much nearer to Labor than to Jabotinskys ideas  is a strategic hawk
For ideological hawks compromises are treason how can you jeopardize the historical patrimony of the Jewish people let alone Gods promise to Abraham
Strategic hawks however are open to practical bargains and compromises  if the circumstances are right and if the security considerations justify it in their eyes
It is in this context that Sharons moves should be seen
He was elected on the promise that he would bring peace and security
He has brought neither
With the defeat and demise of Saddam Hussein the danger of an Eastern front against Israel has diminished
Absent a Palestinian partner and given continuing Palestinian terrorism  which Israels harsh responses fail to quell  what Sharon appears to be doing now follows from his strategicoriented thinking set up an effective barrier move some of the isolated and strategically untenable settlements and wait for another day
If one follows Sharons statements in the last year a clear pattern emerges
First he admitted that eventually a Palestinian state would emerge  something unthinkable for dyedinthewool ideological hawks
A few months later he scandalized his own Likud party conference by stating that occupation is wrong and untenable  another shock for those who always speak of liberated rather than occupied territories
Last December he explicitly stated that Israel is headed towards unilateral disengagement and that this would entail the relocation of some settlements
Although this was still merely verbiage it was novel language for a Likud prime minister
Sharons latest statements though explicitly specified the settlements to be evacuated the Director of the National Security Council General Giora Eiland was appointed to chair an interministerial Relocation Committee and work out plans for conducting the evacuations including compensation for relocated settlers
All of this has radically altered Israels domestic political map
Some ideological hawks in Sharons government threatened to resign Shimon Peres announced that Labor will offer Sharon a parliamentary safety net there is even talk about Labor joining a national unity government
The test of course is not in the planning but in the implementation of withdrawal and the road is long and bumpy
Sharons timing may have been determined by his problems with police investigations into alleged corruption
Yet anyone who would like to predict Sharons future behavior should remember that unlike Begin and Shamir Sharon comes from the military and for him security  not ideology  is supreme
So his apparent pragmatism should come as no surprise
A Flat World and a Round Ball
With the final stage of the World Cup approaching now is a good opportunity for a midtournament appraisal
This year Cup unlike the previous one in Japan and South Korea in  didn witness any real upsets in the first round
Switzerland and Australia surprisingly reached the elimination round and the Asian and African teams disappointed somewhat with only Ghana advancing
There have been just two ugly matches so far full of fouls nasty attacks and unnecessary aggression as well as numerous yellow and red cards Italy vs the US and Portugal vs the Netherlands
Otherwise wee experiencing a wonderful Cup in Germany in terms of both sportsmanship and the overall atmosphere
As for Germany and the Germans one hardly recognizes one own country and people
Even Mother Nature has played along
After a long winter and a nonexistent spring summer started promptly with the first kickoff  and virtually overnight Germany has flaunted its sunniest and most delightful side
The weather is Mediterranean and all of a sudden so are the people
The Cup organization has been exceptional as was to be expected with excellent police work giving hooligans hardly a chance
The whole of Germany has been celebrating a neverending party with guests from all over the world which was not expected
And the German team has put on a wonderful display of heart warming and modern offensive soccer which nobody could have expected
More importantly not only in the German team but also in the country as a whole a young cool laidback and carefree Germany is raising its head  a Germany that is cosmopolitan friendly and goodhumored
Years of bad news appear to have passed the Germans by without a trace
Doctors are on strike taxes are on the rise the parties in government are mauling each other and Chancellor Angela Merkel herself proclaimed in a prominent speech that the country is in disastrous shape
But the Germans undaunted by it all simply keep celebrating one great soccer party with their newfound friends from all over the world
The black red and gold German tricolor adorns the entire country as never before but almost nowhere are there nationalist undertones
In fact the flags of many nations fly alongside German
In Berlin as in other large German cities taxis sport the flags of their drivers home countries  from Angola to Saudi Arabia
Fans don not just their nations flags but also fantastic costumes evocative of their home countries colors
Flags are flown in hope of victory but also serve to dry the tears of defeat
In short Germany during the World Cup is reminiscent of a Shakespearean midsummer night dream with a touch of Woodstock to boot
Outside the stadiums public screenings of the games have become joyous mass appenings
And how is the soccer
This World Cup demonstrates three main developments that the sport has undergone
First Europe and South America are more dominant than four years ago and remain the unchallenged great powers of international soccer
So we must hope that the World Cup in South Africa in  will finally bring greater global parity
Second international soccer is witnessing the advent of a new generation
Spain Argentina and Germany to name but a few countries have put forward very young teams that have played an impressive game
On the French English and Portuguese teams too it is the young players that have shone  despite the continuing presence of Zidane Beckham and Figo
Even the Brazilian squad is looking more aggressive and likely to score with young players like Robinho and Juninho than with their aging champions from 
This generational change is accelerated by a third development
At the top international level soccer has become faster and more athletic and the top teams can shrink space on the field more effectively
A team that is unable to keep going at full speed for the full  or more minutes switch from defense to offense quickly with the whole team and maintain control of the ball to restrict their opponents movements won stand much of a chance
Here soccer parallels today globalized markets which make similar restructuring of national economies necessary
Unlike economic globalization however it remains to be seen whether this new fastpaced style of soccer will prevail after all the young blood of Spain lost to the Old Boys of France
The sport and its fans will certainly profit if it does
For now we have a World Cup filled with soccer that is being shaped by a new young generation both on and off the playing field  lighthearted enthralling and beautiful to watch
Let hope that when the last whistle blows at the final in Berlin on July  we Germans retain as much of this positive spirit as possible
Germany urgently needs this kind of optimism because unfortunately two universal principles will continue to apply in the future first the winter will return and second the ball is round and the next game is always the most difficult
A Flock of Black Swans
CAMBRIDGE  Throughout history major political and economic shocks have often occurred in August when leaders have gone on vacation believing that world affairs are quiet
Consider World War I outbreak in  the NaziSoviet pact in  the Sputnik launch in  the Berlin Wall in  and the failed coup in Moscow of 
Then there was the Nixon shock of  when the American president took the dollar off the gold standard and imposed wage price and trade controls the  international debt crisis in Mexico the  crisis in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism and the  subprime mortgage crisis in the United States
Many of these shocks constituted events that had previously been considered unthinkable
They were not even on the radar screen
Such developments have been called lack swans  events of inconceivably tiny probability
But in my view lack swan should refer to something else an event that is considered virtually impossible by those whose frame of reference is limited in time and geographical area but not by those who consider other countries and other decades or centuries
The origin of the black swan metaphor was the belief that all swans are white a conclusion that a nineteenthcentury Englishman might have reached based on a lifetime of personal observation and David Hume principle of induction
But ornithologists already knew that black swans existed in Australia having discovered them in nbsp They should not have been viewed as nthinkable
Before September   some experts warned that foreign terrorists might try to blow up American office buildings
Those in power did not take these warnings seriouslynbsp After all t had never happened before
Many Americans did not know the history of terrorist events in other countries and other decades
Likewise until  most Americans based their economic behavior on the assumption that nominal housing prices even if they slowed would not fall because they had not done so before  within living memory in the US
They may not have been aware that housing prices had often fallen in other countries and in the US before the 
Needless to say many indebted homeowners and leveraged bank executives would have made very different decisions had they thought that there was a nonnegligible chance of an outright decline in prices
From  to  financial markets perceived market risk as very low
This was most apparent in the implicit volatilities in options prices such as the VIX
But it was also manifest in junkbond spreads sovereign spreads and many other financial prices
One reason for this historic mispricing of risk is that traders models went back only a few years or at most a few decades the period of the late reat Moderation
Traders should have gone back much further  or better yet formed judgments based on a more comprehensive assessment of what risks might confront the world economy
Starting in August  supposedly singular black swans begin to multiply quickly
ig banks don fail
No comment
overnments of advanced countries don default
Enough said
Debt troubles in Greece especially should not have surprised anyone least of all northern Europeans
But even when the Greek crisis erupted leaders in Brussels and Frankfurt failed to recognize it as a close cousin of the Argentine crisis of  the Mexican crisis of  and many others in history including among European countries
Nowadays a eurozone breakup has become one of the most widely discussed possible shocks
Considered unthinkable just a short time ago the probability that one or more euro members will drop out is now well above 
A hard landing in China and other emerging markets is another possibility
An oil crisis in the Mideast is the classic blackswan event
Each one catches us by surprise    
Oil prices can rise for many other reasons as they have in recent years
But the most likely crisis scenarios currently stem from either military conflict with Iran or instability in some Arab country
The threat of a supply shock typically fuels a sharp increase in demand for oil inventories  and thus in prices
The most worrisome financial threat is that currently overpriced bond markets will crash
In theory inflation particularly commodityinduced inflation as in  or  could precipitate a collapse
But this seems unlikely
Default in some euro countries or political dysfunction in the US is a much more likely trigger
Evidence of extreme dysfunction in US politics is already plain to see reaching a low in  during the debtceiling showdown also in August which cost America its AAA sovereign rating from Standard amp Poor
In theory as the iscal cliff set for January   approaches fearful investors should start dumping bonds now
But investors still believe that politicians aware of the dire consequences of going over the cliff will again find a lastminute way to avoid it
Perhaps observers believe that a clear result in November elections one way or the other would help to settle things
A true black swan  low probability but high enough to think about  would be a repeat of the disputed  presidential election
There has been no reform since then to ensure that people votes will be counted or that a disputed outcome will not be resolved by political appointees
Scariest on the blackswan list is a terrorist attack with weapons of mass destruction
There is a longstanding gap between terrorism experts perception of the probability of a nuclear event and the probability as perceived by the public
Admittedly the risk is lower now that Osama bin Laden is dead
Last on the list is an unprecedented climate disaster
Environmentalists sometimes underestimate the benefits of technological and economic progress when they reason that a finite supply of resources must imply their eventual exhaustion
But it is equally mistaken to believe that a true climate disaster cannot happen simply because one has not already occurred
Have a nice vacation
A Foreign Policy for New and Old Europe
Watching the news from Iraq I recall when I was Polands Prime Minister during the Gulf War in 
I watched from home on CNN as the first cruise missiles hit Baghdad
Hours later our military informed me that armed conflict was underway in Iraq Yes I know I said Ive been watching the bombardment on TV
Twelve years later Polands Prime Minister didnt need a belated call from his military to know that war was underway in Iraq
All the details of the attack were provided in advance by the US now Polands NATO ally
Indeed Poland has secured a leading role in Iraqs occupation
What a distance Poland has travelled since communisms collapse in 
Little of this however is the result of design for unfortunately we in Poland have not thought through what sort of foreign policy we need as a member of NATO and putative member of the European Union
We remain narrowly focussed on whether an initiative will be immediately good or bad for us
Couple this with a form of foreign policy schizophreniasome Poles think that by simply existing we influence Europes fate others suffer crippling pessimism consigning Poland to permanent secondclass statusand you have a recipe for inertia
Our attitude seems to be that somehow things will sort themselves out
Much of Europe seems to be stuck in the same mindset we say that we want a common foreign and security policy but we do nothing about it until a crisis emerges
Then we squabble about what to do
The time for such laxity is over
For Poland and the other countries of EastCentral Europe that have or are about to join NATO membership in the Alliance didnt really require debate
Our histories of oppression by powerful neighbours told us that collective security within NATO was the
EU membership and the global war on terror however demand a more deeply considered response
Why
Because EU membership affects every aspect of a state economy and society while the war on terror demands a completely new way to conduct diplomacy and security policy
Todays crisis in transatlantic relations and our accidental involvement in it as part of Donald Rumsfelds New Europe means that Poland like every other European state must now decide what it really wants from the EU and NATO
We must consider both our attitude to global problems that were once deemed peripheral to European interests as well what it really means to be an EU partner
Only answers to these questions can reconcile the divide between the new and old Europe as well as the new and old Atlantic worlds
Poland as an ally of the US is not the real headache facing President Jacques Chirac or Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
Instead the French and German leaders are really responding to the growing unpredictability of todays emerging European order
They see new players say Spain rising to shape EU policy particularly foreign policy and sense that their traditional leadership is being challenged
But an EU with  new members simply cannot be run as it has for decades
So the challenge to France and Germany does not arise because Poland is some sort of American Trojan Horse
Instead the EUs structure now demands not only a new consensus about Europes role in the world but also new means to achieve consensus
History cannot be put on hold as Europe sorts out its internal balance of power
The world needs a united continent ready to go into action
That consensus must include the US
During the Cold War most Europeans tolerated Americas tendency to lead unilaterally because of the Soviet threat and the preponderance of US power
But America is having a hard time understanding the new circumstances of the postCold war era
Its difficulties are exacerbated by the dramatic disparity in military forces on either side of the Atlantic and its belief that Europes ambitions to become a military power will come to nothing because Europeans wont spend the money necessary to achieve that goal
Here is where Poland can help bridge the Atlantic divide and forge a European consensus
September  taught every Pole that military power must be real to be effective
Intentions dont deter invasions
As Danish Premier Anders Fogh Rasmussen recently said France and Germany are not in a position to guarantee our countrys security
The US is but security does not come free of charge
Most Poles think that Polands situation is akin to Denmarks
Indeed all of Europe is in thrall to American power
But this dependence should not disguise the fact that there is a commonality of foreign policy interests between Europe and America
If the EU builds its foreign and security policy on the basis of recognition of this truth many of todays divisions will disappear
The EUs foreign policy should be guided by the following goals
fight terrorism
prevent local conflict
promote human rights and democracy
oblige unpredictable countries to become responsible
maintain close cooperation between Europe and the US
help poor countries
Polish foreign policy like that of the EU can only be effective in the long term if it takes realistic stepsand spends the necessary moneyto realize these objectives
They are the only possible bedrock in transatlantic relations in an expanded Union and in relations between the New and Old Europe
A Fracking Good Story
PRAGUE  Weather conditions around the world this summer have provided ample fodder for the global warming debate
Droughts and heat waves are a harbinger of our future carbon cuts are needed now more than ever and yet meaningful policies have not been enacted
But beyond this welltrodden battlefield something amazing has happened Carbondioxide emissions in the United States have dropped to their lowest level in  years
Estimating on the basis of data from the US Energy Information Agency EIA from the first five months of  this year expected CO emissions have declined by more than  million tons or  from their peak in 
The cause is an unprecedented switch to natural gas which emits  less carbon per energy unit
The US used to generate about half its electricity from coal and roughly  from gas
Over the past five years those numbers have changed first slowly and now dramatically in April of this year coal share in power generation plummeted to just  on par with gas
America rapid switch to natural gas is the result of three decades of technological innovation particularly the development of hydraulic fracturing or racking which has opened up large new resources of previously inaccessible shale gas
Despite some legitimate concerns about safety it is hard to overstate the overwhelming benefits
For starters fracking has caused gas prices to drop dramatically
Adjusted for inflation gas has not been this cheap for the past  years with the price this year  times lower than it was in the mid
And while a flagging economy may explain a small portion of the drop in US carbon emissions the EIA emphasizes that the major explanation is natural gas
The reduction is even more impressive when one considers that  million additional energy consumers were added to the US population over the past two decades
Indeed US carbon emissions have dropped some  per capita and are now at their lowest level since Dwight D Eisenhower left the White House in 
David Victor an energy expert at the University of California San Diego estimates that the shift from coal to natural gas has reduced US emissions by  megatonnes Mt of CO per year
To put that number in perspective it is about twice the total effect of the Kyoto Protocol on carbon emissions in the rest of the world including the European Union
It is tempting to believe that renewable energy sources are responsible for emissions reductions but the numbers clearly say otherwise
Accounting for a reduction of  Mt of CO per year America  wind turbines reduce emissions by just onetenth the amount that natural gas does
Biofuels reduce emissions by only ten Mt and solar panels by a paltry three Mt
This flies in the face of conventional thinking which continues to claim that mandating carbon reductions  through capandtrade or a carbon tax  is the only way to combat climate change
But based on Europe experience such policies are precisely the wrong way to address global warming
Since  the EU has heavily subsidized solar and wind energy at a cost of more than  billion annually
Yet its per capita CO emissions have fallen by less than half of the reduction achieved in the US  even in percentage terms the US is now doing better
Because of broad European skepticism about fracking there is no gas miracle in the EU while the abundance of heavily subsidized renewables has caused overachievement of the CO target
Along with the closure of German nuclear power stations this has led ironically to a resurgence of coal
Wellmeaning US politicians have likewise shown how not to tackle global warming with subsidies and tax breaks
The relatively small reduction in emissions achieved through wind power costs more than  billion annually and far smaller reductions from ethanol biofuels and solar panels cost at least  and  billion annually
Estimates suggest that using carbon taxes to achieve a further  Mt CO reduction in the EU would cost  billion per year
Meanwhile the fracking bonanza in the US not only delivers a much greater reduction for free but also creates longterm social benefits through lower energy costs
The amazing truth is that fracking has succeeded where Kyoto and carbon taxes have failed
As shown in a study by the Breakthrough Institute fracking was built on substantial government investment in technological innovation for three decades
Climate economists repeatedly have pointed out that such energy innovation is the most effective climate solution because it is the surest way to drive the price of future green energy sources below that of fossil fuels
By contrast subsidizing current ineffective solar power or ethanol mostly wastes money while benefiting special interests
Fracking is not a panacea but it really is by far this decade best greenenergy option
A Free Lunch for America
BERKELEY  Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers had a good line at the International Monetary Fund meetings this year governments he said are trying to treat a broken ankle when the patient is facing organ failure
Summers was criticizing Europe focus on the secondorder issue of Greece while far graver imbalances  between the EU north and south and between reckless banks creditors and governments that failed to regulate properly  worsen with each passing day
But on the other side of the Atlantic Americans have no reason to feel smug
Summers could have used the same metaphor to criticize the United States where the continued focus on the longrun funding dilemmas of social insurance is sucking all of the oxygen out of efforts to deal with America macroeconomic and unemployment crisis
The US government can currently borrow for  years at a real inflationadjusted interest rate of  per year
Suppose that the US government were to borrow an extra  billion over the next two years and spend it on infrastructure  even unproductively on projects for which the social rate of return is a measly  per year
Suppose that  as seems to be the case  the simple Keynesian governmentexpenditure multiplier on this spending is only two
In that case the  billion of extra federal infrastructure spending over the next two years would produce  trillion of extra output of goods and services generate approximately seven million personyears of extra employment and push down the unemployment rate by two percentage points in each of those years
And with tighter laborforce attachment on the part of those who have jobs the unemployment rate thereafter would likely be about  percentage points lower in the indefinite future
The impressive gains don stop there
Better infrastructure would mean an extra  billion a year of income and social welfare
A lower unemployment rate into the future would mean another  billion a year in higher production
And half of the extra  trillion of goods and services would show up as consumption goods and services for American households
In sum on the benefits side of the equation more jobs now  billion of additional consumption of goods and services over the next two years and then a  billion a year flow of higher incomes and production each year thereafter
So what are the likely costs of an extra  billion in infrastructure spending over the next two years
For starters the  billion of extra government spending would likely be offset by  billion of increased tax collections from higher economic activity
So the net result would be a  billion increase in the national debt
American taxpayers would then have to pay  billion a year in real interest on that extra national debt over the next  years and then pay off or roll over the entire  billion
The  billion a year of higher economic activity would however generate roughly  billion a year in additional tax revenue
Using some of it to pay the real interest on the debt and saving the rest would mean that when the bill comes due the taxfinanced reserves generated by the healthier economy would be more than enough to pay off the additional national debt
In other words taxpayers win because the benefits from the healthier economy would more than compensate for the costs of servicing the higher national debt enabling the government to provide more services without raising tax rates
Households win too because they get to buy more and nicer things with their incomes
Companies win because goods and workers get to use the improved infrastructure
The unemployed win because some of them get jobs
And even bond investors win because they get their money back with the interest for which they contracted
So what is not to like
Nothing
How you might ask can I say this
I am an economist  a professor of the Dismal Science in which there are no free lunches in which benefits are always balanced by costs and in which stories that sound too good to be true almost inevitably are
But there are two things different about today
First the US labor market is failing so badly that expanded government spending carries no resource cost to society as a whole
Second bond investors are being really stupid
In a world in which the SampP  has a  annual earnings yield nobody should be happy holding a US government year inflationadjusted bond that yields  per year
That sixpercentagepoint difference in anticipated real yield is a measure of bond investors extraordinary and irrational panic
They are willing to pay  per year for afety
Right now however the US government can manufacture afety out of thin air merely by printing bonds
The government too would then win by pocketing that  per year of value  though  years from now bondholders who feel like winners now would most likely look at their portfolios extraordinarily poor performance of over  and rue their strategy
A French Cure for the Resource Curse
NEW YORK  The campaign to ensure that companies engaged in extractive activities disclose all of their payments in their host countries is gaining momentum  and France is leading the effort
President Nicolas Sarkozy should be applauded for supporting a new initiative promoting strict transparency standards for petroleum gas and mining companies listed on European stock exchanges
France at the heart of the European Union and President of both the G and G this year is in an exceptional position to encourage such a regulatory move
With French leadership  offers a golden opportunity for the most important capital markets to adopt clear precise rules requiring full financial disclosure by extractiveindustry companies to governmental authorities
Oil gas and mining generate billions of dollars per year for governments and companies
Moreover these industries often play a central role in the economic development of resourcerich countries
Yet despite great natural wealth a majority of people in these countries lives in poverty
The actual taxes and payments made by mining oil and other extractiveindustry companies to governments are usually a wellkept secret even though most of these governments claim to use the revenue for the public good
In reality in far too many countries ordinary citizens do not benefit from any of this money in fact they must bear the brunt of the environmental and social costs imposed by mining and drilling operations
Indeed these wellkept industry and government secrets can have serious and widespread repercussions
Witness the upheaval in North Africa and the Middle East
In these countries many of which are rich in oil and gas citizens are staging protests against corruption and political repression
At bottom they are protesting against the mismanagement of their countries wealth and resources  with implications that affect the security and affordability of the entire world energy supplies
Transparency is an essential part of the solution
Citizens everywhere must be assured that oil and gas firms as well as mining companies publish all of their relevant financial information broken down by country and by project and including all payments made to hostcountry public budgets
If European regulators can agree on this requirement for all extractiveindustry companies listed on their stock exchanges this transparency norm will be applied to companies regardless of where their headquarters are located
Regulators must also stipulate that company reports be made available on a regular timely basis and that they are easily accessible and comparable across countries and other extractive companies
The United States has already passed legislation requiring public disclosure of payments to governments through the  DoddFrank law
That law requirement that companies fully disclose their revenue streams by country and by project applies to  of international oil and gas companies and to eight of the ten largest mining companies
This will help citizens track how that money is used but it will not help them to assess whether their governments are collecting a fair share
If the EU were to require companies to publish detailed information regarding production and operational numbers financial and accounting balances and payments to authorities companies would become truly accountable to citizens and government revenues would be augmented
Such regulatory reform is now under consideration by the European Commission and French support is imperative if the EU is to announce this month the necessary legislative moves to promote transparency
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde recently highlighted the necessity of promoting nitiatives within industrial sectors that aim to enhance governance integrity and transparency in economic transactions
At its justcompleted summit in Deauville France the G called for the first time for mandatory reporting by oil gas and mining companies
This is an important advance but unfortunately it is qualified by language that allows voluntary approaches as an alternative and it focuses only on payments transparency
Now the world must look to the G summit in Cannes this November to make an unequivocal commitment to the reporting requirements needed given that important emerging economies such as Brazil India and China as well as South Africa and other resourcerich African countries will be at the table
The importance of financial transparency in the extractive industries is not limited to one country or era  and it is too important to be left to voluntary efforts alone
Greater accountability and stronger governance for such companies could potentially change lives economies and political systems around the world
A French Election AmericanStyle
PARIS  Primary elections in France
The idea that a large number of voters should designate the presidential candidates of the major political parties was born in the United States and we French have long believed that such things were American to the core
But has the political primary now been successfully transplanted to Europe
Until recently nothing would have appeared more foreign to French political culture
Choosing candidates has been an affair confined solely to political parties
The idea of  public ournament to select a party nominee was first proposed in the  by the rightwing politician Charles Pasqua but without success
It was ultimately the usually more Americaphobic French left that successfully adopted the practice in  in order to nominate Lionel Jospin for president and then in a more dramatic chain of events to nominate Sgolne Royal in 
But neither was as monumental as the Socialists most recent primary
Based on the Italian experience  also on the political left  of  and  the Socialist party has in effect decided that its candidate for the  presidential election would be decided on the basis of an expanded primary
Not only would registered Socialist voters be able to participate so would all voters who agree to sign a moral charter attesting to the values of the left and were willing to donate a nominal sum of one euro to the party
The Socialists had initially envisioned a process following the American example which was to include successive votes beginning at the departmental level before continuing to a nationwide poll
But given France size the party finally decided that it was preferable to limit itself to one national vote but in two stages which took place on October  and 
Of course protests were raised notably from the right regarding the primary constitutionality the legitimacy of using public facilities for a rivate election and the legality of using electoral lists that sometimes include confidential information
But while the participants represented only a limited part of the electorate  million voted in the first round and more than three million in the subsequent runoff between the two top candidates confirming broad public acceptance of the process as legitimate and valuable
Further affirming the primary importance the three debates between the six candidates before the first round of voting and the debate between the final two candidates Martine Aubry and Franois Holland attracted a large television audience
Indeed the debates high ratings had the unintended consequence of allowing the Socialist party to dominate France media landscape for weeks
It thus appears that the introduction of primaries represents an important innovation that gives to citizens a new way to participate in and contribute to public life
In fact at a time of widespread alienation from the institutions of representative democracy direct citizen participation in nominating candidates is probably an irreversible trend
This is particularly true in the case of presidential elections which have been regarded since  as the key to the legitimacy of all French political institutions
Although President Nicolas Sarkozy recently opposed the use of primary elections in his own party many of those responsible for his legislative majority including Prime Minister Francois Fillon seem to consider it likely that the French right will also begin the practice of using political primaries if not in  because Sarkozy will run again then in 
But there are risks to embracing primaries
For one thing they increase the personalization of political power which can overwhelm established codes of civility
True despite certain contested events in the days preceding the Socialist runoff the level of brutishness among candidates was limited
But it is certain that arguments used in the primaries against Holland the ultimate winner will be reused the moment the presidential election campaign begins
More generally it remains to be seen how willing the rival candidates in party primaries will be to reunite under the same political banner for the election
As in the US however lingering divisiveness may be a price worth paying for a tool with which to renew the principles and practice of the democratic spirit
A French Presidential Primer
The late British Prime Minister Harold Wilson used to quip that  week is a long time in politics
So in the  or so weeks between now and the next French presidential election any prediction made today could be reversed and reversed again before the vote
But two candidates have emerged as clear and constant favorites in opinion polls Nicolas Sarkozy on the right and Sgolne Royal on the left
In fact they have more in common than meets the eye for each speaks of a rupture with the past while incarnating a form of continuity
For Sarkozy upture reflects both mundanely tactical and deeply personal choices
The  years of Jacques Chirac presidency together with France tradition of alternation in power suggests a victory for the left
Positioning himself as the candidate who represents a sharp break with today unpopular politics is the only means to escape that fate
This is reflected in Sarkozy openly proAmerican stance  an act of political courage in a France where antiAmericanism is running high
Sarkozy message is that Chirac and Villepin were right in substance to oppose America military adventure in Iraq but that their style was disastrously wrong
Thus his deep admiration for merican values while sincere implies no embrace of President George W Bush
It also reassures the French business community which was shocked by Dominique de Villepin flamboyant opposition to the United States when he was Chirac foreign minister
At home Sarkozy has aimed his message particularly at the young issuing a patriotic call to the values of work and discipline a counterrevolutionary revolution
The revolution that must be overcome is that of May  whose leaders and supporters according to Sarkozy may have lost politically to de Gaulle but deeply weakened France over the succeeding decades with their emphasis on alse values
By contrast rebelling against one parents generation and rediscovering traditional moral stances will save France  a message that is highly applicable to issues such as education and immigration that may dominate the electoral campaign
In the case of Royal the meaning of upture is both more obvious and more visible
She is seeking to become the first woman President of the French Republic
To achieve her goal she prefers to emphasize her ssence thereby countering Sarkozy stress on his record as a oer
Her appeal to voters is simple  am a woman and you have never tried a woman so be modern and try one now
Hiding behind the originality in French presidential politics of her gender Royal has avoided specifying a detailed program
When challenged by inquisitive journalists demanding greater precision about her policy agenda her highly effective line of defense so far has been ou would not dare to ask me such a question if I were not a woman
Thus Royal program is her popularity
In foreign policy one can only guess what her priorities would be
As far as Europe is concerned she seems as gnostic as Sarkozy who like her incarnates a new generation of ostEuropean leaders
In terms of values Royal too seems to represent a rupture with May  with her emphasis on discipline and family
According to public opinion polls Royal is the clear favorite of the left and the only candidate able to defeat Sarkozy
Her support is particularly strong among women voters
For the Socialist Party which is eager to return to power but has not yet recovered from the humiliating defeat of Lionel Jospin in the first round of the presidential election in  the question is whether it can afford to resist the wave of favorable public opinion behind Royal
In the opinion of Royal many opponents among Socialist leaders and militants the dominance of the media in the political process is leading to mediocrity the qualities required to be elected are becoming nearly incompatible with those needed to govern
According to Royal Socialist critics the ollywoodization of politics from which she benefits entails a new approach in which leaders follow and followers lead
But the same criticism can be directed at Sarkozy
Moreover both candidates embody continuity  with Chirac Gaullist side for Sarkozy and with Franois Mitterrand for Royal  as much as rupture
Royal openly claims Mitterand legacy as she searches for legitimacy while Sarkozy rejection of Chirac legacy has more to do with form than substance
To a large extent Sarkozy can be seen as Chirac with more whereas Royal is clearly Mitterrand with less
When the voters decide in the spring of  their choice may depend more on negative than positive considerations as it did in  when Chirac faced the odious nationalist JeanMarie Le Pen in the second round
As in  the winner next year will be whomever the electorate dislikes or fears less
But one way or the other personalities will prevail over programs
A Fresh Start for China and Japan
Edmonton  Chinese President Hu Jintao will make a highprofile visit to Japan from May  making him the second Chinese head of state ever to travel there
The trip is being carefully managed by both countries and is being watched closely around the world with good reason SinoJapanese relations over the past decade have been turbulent to say the least
When Hu predecessor Jiang Zemin traveled to Japan ten years ago bilateral relations were deteriorating China was unhappy with the Japanese government refusal to extend the same apology offered to South Korea for past aggression Japan was worried about a rising China and thus turning more confrontational
The Japanese media coverage of the visit was overwhelmingly negative and it was remembered as a publicrelations disaster
Hu succeeded Jiang in  almost as former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi was coming to power in Japan and encouraged ew Thinking in China Japan policy which would entail moving away from historical grievances and promoting better ties
But instead of accepting China olive branch Koizumi implemented a more nationalistic agenda including annual visits to the Yasukuni Shine which is regarded as a symbol of Japanese militarism by Japan neighbors
His hardline approach isolated Japan and angered China leading to an outburst of antiJapanese demonstrations in China in 
But both Japan and China recognize that further tension will serve neither country longterm interests
Koizumi successors Prime Ministers Shinzo Abe and Yasuo Fukuda have sought to engage China over the past two years with summits in Beijing and a successful visit by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to Japan last year
Hu trip is likely follow the example set by Wen
He will emphasize common strategic interests highlight mutual economic benefits generate positive public opinion and promote further exchanges
Japan is not only one of China largest trade and investment partners it is also the most powerful neighbor with which China wants to be on good terms partly to showcase that China rise is not a threat to Asia and the rest of the world
Japan whose economic recovery is attributable largely to its deepening ties with China in recent years is also eager to demonstrate that it regards China not as a threat but as an opportunity as least in economic terms
It was  years ago that former Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda the father of today prime minister signed a Peace and Friendship Treaty with China
The two governments will certainly use Hu visit to celebrate the anniversary with new programs designed to enhance bilateral understanding and friendship
But unlike three decades ago when the Japanese regarded China as one of their most favored countries public opinion in both countries nowadays registers more negative feelings than positive ones
Behind the smiles the polite interactions and the cautiously worded diplomatic language strong undercurrents of suspicion remain
One problem is the disputed waters of the East China Sea
Despite new joint projects in energy efficiency and environmental protection areas in which China ranks Japan as the best performer among industrialized countries the two sides remain in bitterly divided over these territorial waters which contain huge potential oil gas and other mineral deposits
Even after many rounds of talks no resolution is in sight and Hu visit is not expected to produce any breakthroughs
Then there are strategic suspicions
Fukuda has dropped Abe talk about an rch of freedom  an effort to forge a bloc with the United States Australia and India
But Japan remains concerned about China rapidly modernizing military while China worries about a potential USJapan containment strategy for China especially in the case of a crisis in the Taiwan Straits
So although both sides endorse the idea of a utually beneficial strategic relationship and despite progress bilateral on military exchanges mutual trust and confidencebuilding have a long way to go
Moreover today arm politics cool economics trend is the reverse of the old politics warm economics pattern under Koizumi
Last year Japan committed investment projects in China fell  from  while actual investment volume decreased by  partly owing to regulatory changes in China regarding foreign investment
Recent food safety issues such as the oisoned dumplings cases have clearly heightened the Japanese public sensitivity about Chinese exports
Finally historical issues could still resurface to cause new problems
While Fukuda has made it clear that he will not visit the Yasukuni Shrine  other parliamentarians paid homage at the site last month an indication that conservative forces in Japan remain strong and that future prime ministers may not abstain from visiting Yasukuni
And Japan has so far failed to live up to its treaty obligations to clean up between  and two million chemical weapons that were abandoned in China by the Japanese army at the end of World War II another potential flash point if any of these weapons causes casualties in China
A Fresh Start for Europe in Latin America
MILAN  By  Brazil and Mexico will be among the world six leading economies according to analysts at the investment bank Goldman Sachs
Does the European Union care
Is Latin America to be Europe next missed business opportunity
Latin America has a population of  million with average yearly per capita income of  immense natural resources and substantial human capital
It accounts for  of world production and grew by more than  in each of the past three years
Although the United States remains the main destination of Latin American and Caribbean exports Asia is becoming an increasingly important market for goods based on natural resources
During the past four years Latin America attracted an annual average of  billion in foreign direct investment  of which went to Brazil and Mexico
In the  foreign investors were chiefly attracted by privatization programs in the region but more recently mergers and acquisitions and greenfield projects have been the most common type of investment
Predictably Spain is the most important European investor in the region though several important Spanish operations have recently passed to Italian companies among them the utility Endesa acquired by Enel which is now the biggest private energy distributor in Latin America
Meanwhile Latin American businesses have been increasing their own foreign investments
In  Brazil invested  billion abroad compared to inflows of  billion
Indeed emerging giants from Latin America and Asia will be at the center of worldwide investment in the coming decades
In  Italy Fiat Group and India Tata Motors established a joint venture to make passenger vehicles and engines in India
The following year they extended their partnership to Latin America investing  million in production of a Tata pickup truck at Fiat factory in Cordoba Argentina
It is to be hoped that many more major European corporations will follow suit
But small and medium sized enterprises SMEs  the majority of firms in both Latin America and Europe  find it difficult to trade and invest at international level in part because of high transaction and information costs
In Europe clusters of SMEs appear able to achieve economies of scale and scope and thus to succeed collectively in global markets
This European experience is now being widely studied in Latin America
In Brazil four local production systems have combined to form Project PromosSebraeBID based on the example of Italy industrial districts
Between  and  Brazil SME support services and the Milan Chamber of Commerce created partnerships involving furniture shoes designer lingerie and handicrafts from different regions of the country
This approach may well be the shape of things to come
But while the EU association agreement with Mexico is  years old it does not yet have a strategic partnership with Brazil
This is partly because of the neverending negotiation process with Mercosur the troubled  and still incomplete  Latin American customs union
The EU is currently negotiating trade liberalization deals with all of Latin America regional blocs Mercosur the Caribbean Community the Central America Common Market and the Andean Community
The EU must urge its Latin American partners towards further integration
Adopting a common ule of origin for their products would be an incentive to liberalize their international trade further thus increasing it
Full trade liberalization in Latin America although difficult to achieve must be made central to EU strategy and would boost economic growth
But even if tariffs and quotas are progressively reduced trade flows may remain low if other trade costs remain high
EU cooperation thus should be directed to lowering trade costs
The crucial issue is market access
Most Latin American countries still get poor results from their efforts to export to Europe the exceptions being raw materials and energy resources
After the establishment of the EUChile freetrade area Chilean exports to the EU increased substantially
But in the case of EUMexico trade liberalization the growth of imports from the EU has exceeded the growth of exports to Europe resulting in a widening Mexican trade deficit with the EU
This is at odds with the EU proclamations since the  Rio summit that Latin America is a vital political and economic partner
A change in Europe approach is needed if a strategic partnership is to be created
The European Commission understands this
Although the EU does not have a strategic partnership with Brazil it intends to push ahead with one as fast as possible
In mid the Commission confirmed that it will revisit the EU dialogue with Mercosur with the aim of giving new impetus to negotiations
But there is also keen awareness that the EU hope for a special relationship with Brazil must not be allowed to hinder regional integration or worsen asymmetries and imbalances within the bloc
If Latin America is to become a strategic partner for the EU and a more attractive market for European companies European institutions must become more open to the region needs
A fresh start by the EU with Brazil and Mexico could prove promising because of the ull it might have on other countries
But this must be accompanied by measures to keep all Latin American countries on board
Otherwise Latin America may well prove to be Europe next missed business opportunity
A Fresh Start for Europe
As Europe leaders gather in Portugal to put the finishing touches on the new slimmed down Reform Treaty it might be helpful if they all pretended that the last  years of European integration had never taken place
Let then imagine what Europe needs to do to confront its most pressing challenges especially if it were able to do so without the political constraints of  years of EU dealmaking and ramshackle institutionbuilding
On top of that let us make a major leap of imagination and suppose that even though this scenario of the EU at ear Zero means we would not have a halfcentury of intraEuropean cooperation to draw on the nations that today make up the EU would nevertheless be keen to adopt farreaching joint policies
Let suspend our disbelief then and try to imagine what Europe could and should be doing to tackle some of the most farreaching and obstinate policy challenges that will determine whether the next  years are as constructive as the last
Or to put it another way let look at our problems in the light of the EU existing mechanisms and its potential for creating farreaching new policies and then let ask ourselves why the EU isn realizing its own potential and delivering the goods
Broadly we see three areas in which Europe policymakers at both the national and EU levels can do better global challenges where Europe could show greater leadership the creation and strengthening of human capital within the EU and worldwide and improvement in the effectiveness of the EU own political machinery
Europe needs a clearer and more recognizable global agenda
It needs to build substantially on its leadership on climate change by adopting much tougher EU goals and then use its international economic and trade clout to champion new global emissions standards that scientific opinion can accept as meaningful
On conflict and security issues Europe should be advancing to a new phase in which it takes much clearer and unambiguous positions on issues ranging from nuclear proliferation to sanctions against Burma military regime
The purpose must be to establish Europe as a forceful and fairminded player on the world stage rather than as a road church in which different viewpoints coexist
The aim should be that oft power instruments like EU development aid and economic partnerships would be linked with a growing sense of political and security outreach to ensure Europe is a global player to be reckoned with
That means of course that the EU should seek to widen its transatlantic thinking so that the EU and the United States cooperate more closely on defining  and thus protecting  their common interests in a world where together they account for little more than  of the total population
These points are far from a blanket criticism of the EU efforts to create a common foreign and security policy
But they are intended to underline what many people in Europe know very well which is that the speed with which problems concerning international development and conflict are growing easily outpaces the EU policy responses so far
Building more human capital in Europe and worldwide is a crucially important element in future EU activities
Education is by far the most profitable investment Europe can make so it should be launching its most ambitious strategy ever to create a new knowledge dynamic and employment inside the EU while helping to expand greatly education in the world poorest countries
Europe also must at last grasp the nettle of immigration policy  something that has persistently eluded generations of political leaders
Agreed EUwide immigration rules are needed to reconcile shrinking Europe hunger for imported labor with widespread fears of cultural tensions and social unrest
It won be easy to create a fairer and more multicultural Europe but failure to address this problem openly will carry an even heavier price
By much the same token Europe governments should be making a determined new effort to strengthen Europeans sense of a shared history and common values
A stronger European identity is the soundest basis for creating the more multicultural society that demographers regard as inevitable
Meanwhile doubts still surround the political and institutional machinery the EU will need to realize these and other ambitious goals
Sighs of relief greeted EU leaders midyear agreement on a Reform Treaty aimed at overhauling the Union decisionmaking mechanisms but it is still uncertain whether the new pact will survive the ratification process in  countries
We believe though that the increased use of qualified majority voting by member governments embodied in the new treaty should also be applied to the ratification process itself
That way if a small minority of EU governments prove unable to ratify the treaty it would not be torpedoed the way that its predecessor the Constitutional Treaty was in 
A Future for the Worldus Coral Reefs
Coral reefs are the worlds most biologically rich marine ecosystems harboring some of the worlds most beautiful organisms
They provide the principal source of protein for over ten million people worldwide
Reefbased activities principally fishing and tourism form the economic livelihood of millions more
Clearly the human costs of a worldwide breakdown of these ecosystems are enormous
Yet global deterioration of coral reefs is severe and ongoing
Wholesale disintegration of reef ecosystems has occurred in some places and collapse on a worldwide scale is a real risk
But there is some good news too we know what steps the international community can take now to protect and restore reefs resilience their capacity to maintain integrity in the face of the environmental fluctuations that are a natural part of life in any ecosystem
We must mediate the severity of global warming while simultaneously conserving the resilience of coral reefs
Historically the principal agents of reef degradation have been overfishing and pollution not global warming
In healthy ecosystems when prey numbers decline predators become malnourished and their numbers decline too giving their prey a chance to recover
But human predators are different
When our prey numbers decline their economic value tends to increase so fishing intensifies
This means that once predator species become depleted fishing pressure shifts towards planteating fish species leading to precipitous declines in the numbers of herbivores on coral reefs
Herbivorous fish are key players on coral reefs
When coral populations decline in the aftermath of cyclones diseases and other disturbances it is the herbivores that keep seaweed in check and allow coral populations to recover
Without them fastgrowing seaweed quickly monopolizes space on the reef preventing restoration of healthy quantities of coral cover
Because corals provide the habitat structure on which other reef organisms depend the decreases in coral cover lead to big decreases in a reefs biodiversity
Pollution by nutrients and toxins from adjacent land areas further vitiate coral populations ability to recover giving seaweed an even greater competitive edge
Corals are formed by a symbiosis between an animal and a onecelled plant
The animal provides shelter and nutrients for the plant the plant converts sunlight into energy which it shares with the animal
For reasons that are not yet fully understood this partnership breaks down when corals experience unusually high temperatures
The plant is expelled and corals turn a brilliant white color
If temperatures soon return to normal the partnership can be restored
But if corals remain bleached for too long they die
For many species of coral this bleaching threshold is usually only a couple of degrees centigrade above the typical maximum temperature for a given location
Interpreted in light of even the most optimistic global warming scenarios this is disturbing news
If coral bleaching thresholds remain steady local summer temperatures will exceed those thresholds regularly within a few decades
Corals grow slowly so reefs sustaining severe bleaching will not recover before they bleach again
Fortunately there is evidence that bleaching thresholds evolve
Most coral species have broad geographical distributions and bleach at different temperatures depending on location
Many species that bleach at 
Two things can be done to protect coral reefs
The first is obvious minimize global warming by say honoring the Kyoto Treatys emissions targets
Second we must restore coral reefs capacity to cope with environmental changetheir resilienceby protecting the fish stocks that keep seaweed in check and thereby facilitate the recovery of coral populations from bleaching
These recovery phases enable adaptations to higher temperatures to spread
Without fish seaweed dominance will prevent that recovery
The catastrophic collapse of fish stocks around the worldon coral reefs and elsewherehas provided hard lessons about managing fisheries
Many intensively regulated fisheries have collapsed along with the unregulated ones
So there is a growing consensus that standard techniques for managing fisheries must be complemented with a system of notake zonesareas in which fishing is prohibited altogether
As fish populations in these notake zones recover they create spillover effects with catches often increasing in areas outside the notake zones
More importantly they provide a refuge for fish populations a kind of insurance policy against stock collapse
On coral reefs these notake zones can help insure that a portion of coral reef habitat sustains a healthy fish community and secure the coral reef resilience that this brings
Scientific evidence indicates that to be effective  of available habitat should be set aside as notake zones
This figure is far higher than levels of protection in even the wealthiest countries that harbor significant coral reefs the US and Australia where current levels of protection are less than 
Given the magnitude of the threat to the worlds coral reefs the international communitys response has been frighteningly slow
But there is some encouraging news in June Australias government proposed a major increase in notake areas within the Great Barrier Reef to over 
If adopted this policy would set a new global standard and perhaps prompt other nations to follow suit
The future of tropical marine ecosystems and the millions of people whose lives are linked to them depend on it
Obama Doomed eset
MOSCOW  When US President Barack Obama canceled last month 
 scheduled summit in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin he 
 effectively terminated his fouryear effort to eset the bilateral 
 relationship
The failure of that effort should come as no surprise 
 owing to its deeply flawed foundations
While the obvious catalyst for Obama decision was Putin grant of 
 temporary asylum to the former US intelligence contractor Edward 
 Snowden the bilateral relationship has long been faltering
In  
 after the US and its allies convinced Russia former president Dmitri 
 Medvedev not to block a United Nations resolution to impose a nofly 
 zone over Libya they launched a fullscale military bombardment of 
 Libya which helped to bring down the regime  a move that Russian 
 officials called eceptive
Since Putin return to the presidency last year the relationship 
 has deteriorated further owing to disagreements over arms control 
 missile defense and human rights
For example late last year the US 
 Congress imposed sanctions
 against Russian officials implicated in humanrights abuses prompting 
 Russia to institute a ban on adoptions by American families
Moreover Obama and Putin remain at odds over the crisis in Syria 
 Obama continues to support President Bashar alAssad ouster while 
 Putin has been backing the regime owing to fear that its collapse would
 usher in a radical Sunniled government  or chaos
Farther east the 
 US and Russia are not cooperating as expected on Afghanistan postwar 
 transition
But while disagreement on these issues has undoubtedly weakened 
 USRussian ties the real reason that the bilateral relationship has 
 been crumbling is more fundamental
Instead of acknowledging 
 geopolitical shifts and adjusting their relationship accordingly US 
 and Russian officials remain committed to an obsolete postCold War 
 dynamic
While Russia and the US remain capable of destroying each other many 
 times over they have had no intention of doing so for a long time
But 
 admitting that there was no longer any threat of direct attack would 
 have been politically impossible in the aftermath of the Cold War when 
 the bilateral standoff still seemed to be a cornerstone of international
 stability
Today the prospect of either country launching a nuclear attack 
 against the other seems almost ridiculous
Given this the legacy of the
 Cold War should give way to issues like ensuring that China rise 
 remains peaceful preventing the current chaos in the Arab world from 
 spreading beyond the region limiting the scope of nuclearweapons 
 proliferation and contributing to global efforts to address climate 
 change water scarcity food security and cybercrime
But rather than pursuing joint initiatives aimed at advancing the 
 two countries shared interests in these areas the US proposed 
 nuclearweapons reductions as the primary mechanism of the diplomatic 
 reset
Russian diplomats whose outlook also remains largely shaped by 
 the Cold War seized on the proposal
And just like that the old 
 disarmament dynamic was renewed as if by nostalgic old friends
The subsequent negotiations produced the muchvaunted New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
 New START which despite doing little to advance disarmament 
 provided a political boost to both sides and bolstered the bilateral 
 relationship
But progress soon stalled with Russia rejecting US 
 proposals for further reductions especially of tactical nuclear weapons  an area in which Russia dominates
Russia whose nuclear arsenal represents one of the last remaining 
 pillars of its reat power status declared that it would agree to 
 further cuts only after the US offered a legally binding agreement that 
 its proposed antiballistic missile ABM shield in Europe would not be 
 aimed at Russia
In Russia view  which is probably fanciful  such a
 shield could intercept its intercontinental ballistic missiles ICBMs
 thereby posing a strategic threat
In the hope of breaking the deadlock Obama signaled his willingness 
 to compromise
But Putin had little reason to reciprocate not least 
 because agreement on the issue would have opened the way to further 
 nucleararms reductions
Moreover members of Russia military and 
 political elite hoped to use some of the country oil revenues to 
 deploy a new generation of ICBMs
And it seems that some Russians began 
 to believe their own propaganda about the danger posed by a European ABM
 shield
By focusing on nuclear disarmament and New START Obama reset 
 strategy remilitarized the USRussia relationship while marginalizing 
 issues that could have reoriented bilateral ties toward the future
In 
 this sense the initiative was doomed from the start  and the whole 
 world has suffered as a result
Both countries leaders should acknowledge what should now be 
 obvious nuclearweapons reduction can no longer serve as a reliable 
 basis for bilateral relations
But the recent USRussian agreement regarding the removal and 
 destruction of Syria chemicalweapons stockpiles offers hope that the 
 two sides are beginning to set a new agenda based on international law 
 and a shared desire to prevent further deterioration of the desperate 
 situation in the Middle East
Indeed it is possible that Putin Syrian
 intervention will beget greater global influence for Russia
By proposing a diplomatic solution to the use of chemical weapons in 
 Syria Putin offered Obama a way out of the political impasse  
 threatening a military intervention with little support at home or 
 abroad  in which he found himself
If Syria chemical weapons are 
 destroyed the agreement will have established an invaluable precedent 
 concerning the behavior of great powers in a time of crisis
Acting in 
 one own interest and in the interest of the international community 
 need not be mutually exclusive
A Future without Precedent
JERUSALEM  In my nearly nine decades of life I cannot recall a time in which the past was so irrelevant to policymaking
All of today significant developments went unpredicted by anyone
Experts studied the past but constrained by old paradigms they could not discern the future
Today dynamic complexity in which a sciencebased fastchanging global economy makes so many more phenomena interdependent prevents us from foreseeing the future through linear extrapolations of the past
The only certainty is that the future will be defined by scientific progress and innovation which cannot be known ahead of time
As a result the traditional power of states and leaders is declining in today global economy innovators not politicians wield the most influence
The globalized economy affects every state yet no single state can determine the outcomes because science and technology are borderless
Global companies wish to do business worldwide eroding not just sovereignty but also racism and prejudice as well as significantly weakening nationalism
This transformation has placed the world in the hands of a younger generation more technologically savvy than their parents and connected to one another through social networks that are not confined by territory language or government
The young leaders who created Facebook and Google have had a greater global impact than many statesmen and generals
These young people are also the leaders of erupting political protest movements
The rab Spring the tent demonstrations in Israel Occupy Wall Street and the protests in Russia reveal not a clash of civilizations but a battle of generations
The young generation understands that the way states and economies are currently run is unfit for the new era
Yet there are political itchhikers who want to exploit the recent awakening not by promoting an agenda of freedom but by imposing a different type of coercion
In the Arab world it is mainly extreme Islamists who are hijacking the young generation wave stealing their revolution
Israel has reacted positively to the will of the young generation but it cannot and should not intervene in events in the Arab world
Our hearts are with the rebelling youngsters and their legitimate yearning for freedom and basic rights to express themselves choose their leaders and earn their own living
Israelis wait for the day when our country will no longer be the region only democracy because being an island of prosperity in a sea of poverty is unnatural
Yet there is a real concern that the extremists who are politically well organized are seeking to gain control by the ballot over lessorganized liberals thus preventing peace and stability
Fundamentalist radicals cannot provide real solutions to the region basic problems
The social changes now underway threaten their way of life which includes discrimination against women and a ban on modern education
But only profound reforms of traditional authority can pave the way towards freedom and growth
Israel can serve as an example to others striving to reach economic prosperity and social freedom because its success is due to the fact that the country had absolutely nothing at the start
We returned to our homeland rich with history but devoid of natural resources
Israel was left with only one resource its human capital
So we invested in education and science and today we have the world highest percentage of scientists and patents per capita
Roughly  of our agriculture is hitech
We use less water and yield more crops per acre than any other country in the world
What Israel can do others can do as well
We will gladly offer a helping hand to whoever is willing to reach for it
Together in peace with our neighbors we can create a region of hope development and success
In particular we must do everything in our power to end the conflict with the Palestinians
Israel was not born and it is not Israel destiny to govern another people
We are sincerely interested in the establishment of a Palestinian state living peacefully sidebyside with Israel the democratic state of the Jewish people
For us peace is both a moral imperative and a nationalsecurity strategy because resolving the conflict would help to stabilize the region by neutralizing the extremists who seek to manipulate today popular movements to advance their radical agenda
The international community can support these efforts by providing incentives to countries that choose freedom and progress
At the same time determined and decisive policies must be taken against extremists
In particular Iran is a fount of moral corruption that spearheads extremism and halts reform crushing the legitimate protest of its own citizens and acting against the brave Syrians now fighting for their freedom
Iran also uses proxies to instigate terror against moderate forces in the Palestinian Authority Lebanon and Iraq
If Iran is successful in its plan to acquire nuclear weapons its leaders could shake the Middle East and encourage more extremism and violence
Israel will defend itself if Iran continues to call for its destruction
However the threat is not to Israel alone Iran is a danger to the peace and stability of the entire world
The world democracies have declared that they will not allow Iran to possess nuclear arms it is their duty to follow through on that commitment before doing so becomes impossible
Beyond the shortterm challenges ahead we all have a duty to profoundly change the way we prepare our children to cope with today new world
In an era where yesterday has become almost irrelevant and we can hardly predict tomorrow the role of education must allow all children to reach their highest potential
Today educators should inspire our children towards creativity and innovation
Selfexpression is as important as free expression
I write this in the th year of my life but not because I have learned from experience
On the contrary experience is overrated often constraining the courage needed to face tomorrow and build an unprecedented new world
The future is already here there is no point in looking back
A Gasp from Europe
French President Jacques Chirac has alarmed the EU candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe
The French president has accused them of being childish and irresponsible in voicing their proUS stance on the Iraq issue and warned that their position could be dangerous as the decision to let them into the EU has not yet been ratified
Quite a salvo
Then the French president assumed the role of kindergarten instructor visvis what he called badly brought up candidate countries telling them that they were illbehaved and that they missed a great opportunity to shut up
To anyone who remembers that  years ago President Charles de Gaulle slammed Europes door shut in the face of Britains request to join the European communitythe General thought the British too tied to the US to enter the European familythese remarks are worrying
But put things in perspective Jacques Chirac is not Charles de Gaulle and Europe has moved far beyond the time when its agenda was unilaterally written by France
President Chiracs selfappointed role as an expert in diplomatic good behavior cannot be taken seriously even by those of us who know and love France
Instead his outburst is best explained as a sign of frustration over the fact that French influence in the EU is being diluted
Like King Lear after he lost his kingdom there is nothing France can do about its lost influence but rage impotently
But this dispute within Europe goes deeper than the matter of Frances lapsed primacy
I have always been skeptical about the rhetoric of a common foreign policy for the EU
How can you possibly expect a country such as say France to accept being voted down by its EU partners on vital foreign and security policy issues
At best Europe should hope for a more common foreign and security policy even though this fails to answer Henry Kissingers old question If you want to speak to Europe whom do you call
I have long worked to secure a much more common foreign policy within the EU
Therefore I am worried by todays split within the EU as well as between some member countries and the US over Iraq
When eight European leaders published their appeal to heal the growing transatlantic rift they were accused of undermining European unity
Nothing could be more incorrect
They were only exposing the lack of unity that already existed
It all began last autumn when German Chancellor Gerhard Schrder desperate to hold on to power made Iraq an issue in the German election campaign
He played on Germanys wellknown and respectable pacifist feelings
But by declaring that he would not under any circumstance participate in military actions against Iraq he undermined the efforts at the UN to put maximum pressure behind the demands that Iraq disarm
Then France embraced Germany
French ways in foreign policy are often murky and difficult to decipher unless it is crystal clear where France regards its interests to lie
Usually France likes to keep its options open
But when the French and German governments celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the Elyse Treaty last month France seemed to paint herself into a corner by supporting the German view
All this was done without consultations between the French and German governments and their partners within the EU
It was a demonstration of the special relationship between France and Germany that has for so many years been the driving force in European integration
The history of FrancoGerman reconciliation is impressive indeed
But it can no longer be taken for granted that other EU countries will automatically ratify the agreements that they reach between themselves as the lodestar for common policies
This is particularly true when their objective is to establish an alternative to American leadership in security policy
Enlargement of the EU with a number of Central and Eastern European countries will strengthen resistance to FrancoGerman initiatives in this direction
The letter from the eight European leadersand the later statement from the Vilnius Ten group of Central and Eastern European countriesdemonstrated that France and Germany cannot dictate a European agenda that creates transatlantic rifts
This has obviously caused frustrations
But it should not have been a surprise to anyone
The split within the EU and NATO has increased the risk of armed conflict with Iraq because the pressure on Iraq to comply with the UN resolutions was weakened
Chirac and Schrder do not seem to grasp this
So this has not been one of Europes finest hours especially not while the EUs institutional convention is discussing a text that calls for EU governments to actively and unreservedly support the Unions common foreign policy
The German acronym for the EUs common foreign and security policy is GASP
That seems an entirely appropriate expression for what we have been witnessing
A Gazan Education
GAZA  This was supposed to be my first year of medical school
Instead I am stuck here in Gaza in my father house inside the Jabalia refugee camp with few options and no way out
After I finished high school last year I decided to become a doctor
Gaza cries out for bone specialists but the training I need is available only abroad
When I won a place at a medical college in Germany my parents were proud
I was excited to follow my older brother who is already studying there
In February the German authorities granted me an entrance visa
I wasted no time in asking the Israeli authorities for permission to travel to Europe
But I was told that only patients in need of emergency medical evacuation would be allowed out  not students
Hundreds of other young people trapped in the Gaza Strip have won admission to study abroad
For many of us this is our only opportunity to continue our education
Gaza is one of the most densely populated places on earth and one of the poorest   million of us live on a patch of land about  kilometers long and  kilometers wide
The local hospitals lack the equipment needed to perform many important procedures like radiation treatments for cancer patients and heart surgery
Universities in Gaza are overcrowded and starved for supplies
Many subjects are not even taught and there are few postgraduate programs
Instructors from abroad cannot enter Gaza
Without the ability to go overseas we cannot learn
In June after the United States pressured Israel to allow Fulbright scholarship winners to leave the Gaza Strip the Israeli military announced that it would grant exit permits for a few more students with ecognized scholarships  but not undreds
So hundreds of us are still waiting most without prestigious scholarships to draw the world attention
I am sure to be one of the many who will not be allowed to leave
Life in Gaza has bled away my optimism
My father is a teacher and owns a children clothing shop
My mother is a housekeeper
I have six brothers and three sisters
We returned to Palestine in  from Saudi Arabia where my father had been working as a teacher
That was at the height of the peace process
My parents put their hope in the Oslo Accords signed in  and decided that they could give us a better life here
But when I was ten the second
With the backing of the US Canada and the European Union Israel has maintained its blockade in an attempt to defeat Hamas which won the elections here in 
But the blockade only makes people more desperate
Hamas and other armed groups I know have launched rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip that have killed civilians in Israeli towns and villages
But I also have witnessed how Israel has retaliated with air strikes and armed incursions into the Gaza Strip including Jabalia
Israel blockade amounts to collective punishment
It is hurting all of us whether we support Hamas or not
It is also destroying my dream to write pecialist in Bone Medicine after my name
Sometimes I am sorry that I am from Gaza
But my hope is still to go abroad learn skills and return to help others here
Sometimes when there is electricity I watch television and see how people live in other places
I ask myself why they have the opportunity to travel to study to take vacations when I cannot go abroad even to learn medicine
We are students not soldiers
We are not fighters in this
