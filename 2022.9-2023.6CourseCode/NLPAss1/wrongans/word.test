Now as one mordant and widespread slogan puts it Austria is he better Germany
Many French writers also express a vivid feeling of national decline and many ordinary citizens believe that the rules of the global economy work against French national interests
In short the large states still have illusions encouraged by their political elites about what the state can do to guide economic development
By contrast the small European states  whether in Eastern or Western Europe  have been much more flexible in responding to the challenges of the modern globalized economy
Politics can offer all kinds of goods that voters find very attractive tax breaks subsidies and social benefits
But small states are less likely to think that they can create the rules of the game and accordingly they are more willing and able to make adjustments
They are more keenly aware that if they try to redistribute too much they will simply drive away the factors of production capital will flow elsewhere and labor will likewise migrate
The same sort of logic applies to the large states France and Germany are losing skilled labor at the same time as they are drawing in cheaper labor from Eastern Europe
The result is that they are feeling less French or German creating greater political room on both the left and the right for nationalist ressentiment
In the earlier rounds of European integration from the  to the  the big states received very obvious gains which their politicians could easily present as such to voters
But since   or since the Maastricht Treaty came into force in   the political dynamic has changed
It is now the EU smaller states that gain the most from wider and deeper European integration
If the large states are to obtain similar gains and their politicians are to recover voters respect their governments will have to accept the smallstate logic and abandon the Great Power posturing of the past
Europe Smart Asian Pivot
MADRID  For the first time in centuries the focus of the global economy is shifting to the East
The United States has commenced its ivot to Asia and its relations with China in particular seem constantly to be flirting with Thucydides trap the historical pattern that suggests that a rising power will inevitably collide with a reigning power
But with the US and China regarding each another warily in the foreground of world affairs where does Europe fit in
The European Union is at a critical historical juncture one that demands its own pivot eastward  a coherent and decisive Asian strategy that builds on Europe strengths
Although the EU population is only onefifth the size of that of China and India combined and its military presence in Asia is minimal its  trillion  trillion economy is the world largest
This has not gone unnoticed by Asia governments which are heavily dependent on economic growth to meet their young and growing populations demand for jobs and prosperity
Currently Asia is the EU main trading partner surpassing North America and constituting onethird of its total trade
Trade with China alone is worth more than  billion per day second only to trade with the US
Moreover the EU has a somewhat paradoxical asset at its disposal it is not a Pacific power and does not carry the burden of greatpower status in Asia
Far from being a weakness this is precisely the source of the EU potential strength in Asia for it provides a degree of diplomatic agility that the American heavyweight cannot muster
In attempting to execute its strategic pivot the US is haunted at virtually every turn by its status as a historical hegemon a military power and the guarantor of its Asian allies security
Even when rebranded as a ebalancing America eastward shift is inevitably met with suspicion by some Asian countries particularly China
Europe by contrast can use its agility to perform a mart pivot
The EU must engage with Asia on at least three mutually beneficial fronts with trade being the most important
The tradeliberalization agreements that the EU has in the pipeline with Asia vibrant economies including South Korea Singapore Malaysia India Vietnam Japan and Thailand are more ambitious in scope than previous bilateral deals
As largescale regional freetrade arrangements take shape the EU continues to signal unequivocal commitment to free trade through sophisticated bilateral agreements
But trade flows are vulnerable
Of course economic relations between states foster interdependence decreasing the risk of conflict
But if conflict does erupt the cost is far higher
When the territorial dispute between Japan and China over the SenkakuDiaoyu islands flared anew last year Japanese auto exports to China plummeted  in just three months
Herein lies Asia specific paradox a high level of economic integration has not given rise to regional institutions that can support the stability required for sustained prosperity
Instead Asia remains deeply scarred by unsettled disputes periodic fits of nationalism and contested borders all of which tend to be amplified by apprehension stemming from the asymmetric rise of some of its powers
Regional integration is a recipe for longterm stability in Asia and a second line of engagement for the EU
In Europe once torn apart by war armed conflict among EU member states is now almost unthinkable
The EU institutional architecture facilitated the pivot from devastating and recurrent wars to peace and prosperity
But creating that architecture is a daunting task which has taken Europe decades and is still ongoing
Successive quandaries and crises have revealed the flaws in the EU institutional design and each painstaking upgrade has made the European project that much stronger
With no hint of paternalism and recognizing its status as a workinprogress the EU should increase its engagement with Asia existing structures and lend its knowhow where possible  for example in ASEAN shift toward a threepillared design politicalmilitary economic and sociocultural by 
On the global front the EU and China may find themselves to be natural partners on key issues
China is facing increasing pressure particularly from the US to assume a global political role that corresponds to its economic weight
Here China could find an excellent partner in Europe either in a G format with the US or in focused bilateral cooperation
Consider the Middle East
China and Europe might find common cause in the vacuum left as America domestic energy revolution weakens its commitment to the region
As China reliance on Middle East energy resources grows   of the region oil exports will go to Asia by   the need to deepen engagement with oilproducing states will become more acute
Europe the Middle East experienced neighbor could be China strategic partner in this endeavor
Japan is another Asian giant regaining confidence following Prime Minister Shinzo Abe energetic stimulus program
As Japan takes unprecedented tradeliberalization steps in the TransPacific Partnership negotiations with the US and other economies in Asia and the Americas and boosts its regional engagement Europe must maintain its strong ties with the world thirdlargest national economy
The ambitious bilateral trade agreement now under construction is expected to boost exports in both directions by up to onethird
In any comprehensive strategy for engagement with Asia the EU is only as strong as its parts
Though countrytocountry engagement with Asia rising powers may be tempting and while China often prefers bilateral dealings renationalization of EU members foreign policies would be counterproductive
A thickly woven cord is needed to keep Europe reliably anchored as it points eastward whereas separate strands would withstand only a limited degree of strain in the turbulent years ahead
The EU Turn in Afghanistan
Time is running out for success in Afghanistan
The NATO summit in Riga of November  may be the last chance to pull that country back from the brink
NATO assumed responsibility for providing security for all of Afghanistan in October
While about  of the  US troops in Afghanistan operate independently the rest have joined the most ambitious military venture in NATO history the International Security Assistance Force ISAF
Each of the  NATO allies has troops in Afghanistan as do  other countries
Some like Macedonia and Finland belong to the Alliance Partnership for Peace
Others like Australia and South Korea come from farther afield
Soldiers from different countries operate almost as a single unit with shared objectives similar methods compatible equipment and complementary skills
A halfcentury of working together plus a decade and a half of adapting to new threats and demands is paying off
The bad news is that the  foreign troops in Afghanistan are not enough
A few Afghan provinces including those along parts of the border with Pakistan and its Taliban sanctuaries have little or no ISAF presence and no Provincial Reconstruction Teams
Abysmal air and land transport limit the ability to move fighting forces to where they are needed most
Several countries including NATO allies have imposed ational caveats that limit where their troops can be deployed or the tasks they undertake
So before any operation commanders must determine which troops can take part and in what capacity hampering both efficiency and effectiveness
Nevertheless NATO would succeed if outside civilian efforts resources organization and leadership in Afghanistan were equal to its own
Unfortunately there is no central direction or even coordination of civilian efforts
Although nongovernmental organizations are doing an effective job responsibilities assigned to different European countries  such as helping the Afghan government with law enforcement and poppy eradication  have fallen short of both needs and promises
Poppy production is soaring experiments with alternative crops are lagging and there are not enough forces to provide security for farmers willing to try growing something different
So the Taliban are obtaining ample funds from the heroin trade  easily Afghanistan largest single source of foreign earnings
Western drug addicts are putting more money into Afghanistan economy than Western governments
The shortfalls of the civilian effort and the unwillingness or inability of the Afghan government to provide good governance are the country central problems
These factors largely explain the Taliban violent revival and the uncertainty of many Afghans about whom to support
NATO has et the alliance on Afghanistan
No amount of ransformation or artnerships or anything else will matter much if NATO fails for the first time in its history  even if that failure is not of its own making
Firm commitments at Riga of more allied troops and equipment for the ISAF and fewer national aveats must be part of the answer
But allied leaders must also act on the knowledge that NATO does not have the skills resources or experience to take full charge of meeting Afghanistan requirements for external civilian help
That task must belong to the European Union the one institution with the collective means skills resources and  potentially  the leadership to relieve NATO and ISAF of burdens for which they are not suited
Yet the EU holds back
Turf battles with NATO intrude as well as competition between the EU executive Commission and the memberbased Council
Even though  of NATO  members also belong to the EU leaders and bureaucrats in most of these countries have been unwilling to back the commitment of their troops with the economic resources needed
At the Riga summit NATO should challenge the EU to take its proper share of responsibility for success in Afghanistan
This will require the EU to contribute money manpower and officials on the ground of the rank and stature of ISAF commanders in an equal partnership with NATO
By coincidence the EU rotating presidency is now held by Finland
NATO presidents and prime ministers could simply cross the Baltic Sea from Riga for a halfday Afghanistan summit with the EU in Helsinki
One or two EU countries might object that this would mix institutional apples and oranges
But for Europeans who claim equal status with NATO for the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy this is the time to put up or shut up
Even if leaders balk at an extra halfday of meetings to address the most serious threat to NATO future the Riga summit can issue a demand that its own  dual members and the rest of the EU agree to assume shared responsibility in Afghanistan
NATO is in Afghanistan largely owing to shared concerns about terrorism
But NATO is also acting because some European countries want to show Washington that they can pull their security weight even though they refuse to go near the war in Iraq
All NATO allies and EU members want the US to remain committed to Europe future to take the lead elsewhere in meeting security needs on which all agree and to admit Europe into its strategic confidence
That now requires supporting the EU deep involvement in Afghanistan as its key contribution to repairing and reforming the Atlantic Alliance
The EU Viennese Mirror
If a European Union bureaucrat could travel to fin de sicle Vienna he would be surprised by how closely the Hapsburg Empire resembled today EU
Like the EU AustriaHungary was an experiment in supranational engineering comprising  million inhabitants  nationalities and  languages
Presiding over this microcosm of Europe was a doublethroned EmperorKing and twin parliaments representing the largely independent Austrian and Hungarian halves of the realm
The Hapsburg Empire acted as a stabilizing force for its peoples and for Europe
To its scattered ethnic groups it performed the twin roles of referee and bouncer pacifying indigenous rivalries and protecting pintsized nations from predatory states
It also filled a geopolitical vacuum at the heart of the continent placing a check on Germany and Russia
So long as it performed these functions Austria was viewed as a uropean necessity  a balancer of nationalities and of nations for which there was no conceivable substitute
But by the early  the empire faced two problems that cast doubt on its ability to fulfill these missions
First it proved incapable of reconciling and representing its constituents interests
The heart of the problem was the  Compromise which divided the empire into Austrian and Hungarian halves
By excluding the Slavs  who accounted for half the empire population  the Compromise was seen as a vehicle for GermanMagyar domination
All attempts at modifying the arrangement stopped short of what was needed a political settlement between Germans and Slavs like that between Germans and Magyars
Second due in part to internal nationalist crises the empire found it increasingly difficult to chart a unified independent course in international affairs
Confronted after  with a more assertive Russia AustriaHungary resorted to increasing reliance on Germany thereby relinquishing the empire special status as a geopolitical stabilizer
These problems inflicted irreparable damage to AustriaHungary image as a ecessity  both for its subjects who came to see national selfdetermination as a superior alternative to supranationalism and for outside powers which dismembered the empire in 
So ended the first European union
Like AustriaHungary the EU raison dtre consists in its ability to transcend the indigenous balance of power among its members and the service this renders to the international system
On both counts the EU confronted challenges in  much like those confronting AustriaHungary in 
Many of the EU newest members continue to grapple with questions of geopolitical trust
This is revealed in the tensions that have existed between Poland which fears domination by the EU steering group and Germany which is reluctant to shoulder the financial burden for a union in which it is underrepresented
If allowed to fester this feud could metastasize leaving the EU in a state of crisis like that which plagued AustriaHungary
A second set of problems confronts the EU externally
Like AustriaHungary the EU finds itself lodged between two powerful neighbors a resurgent Russia intent on regaining lost influence and a seemingly revisionist United States preoccupied with foreign military adventures
Three lessons of AustriaHungary experience are instructive for the EU
First despite enjoying greater political inclusion than the Habsburg Slavs many Central Europeans see themselves as lacking equal standing with the EU both economically and strategically
The upshot may be a tendency for the new members to press their national interests more forcefully in EU fora
Fearing a new era of obstructionism EU leaders have revived talk of a twospeed union in which a vanguard of western states seeks deeper integration leaving the newcomers to catch up
But as Habsburg history shows such arrangements create entrenched privileges among the aves and grudges among the avenots
In a union of many parts there are no shortcuts the EU must provide the same level of integration at the periphery as at the imperial core
Second just as Austria needed a settlement between Germans and Slavs the EU needs to repeat the FrancoGerman reconciliation of  between its largest western and eastern members Germany and Poland
The shared steel initiative of  could find its parallel in a GermanPolish initiative to jointly manage natural gas imports
Finally much as AustriaHungary formed an alliance with Germany to fill a strategic need for military security EU members have sought through their intake of Russian gas to meet a strategic need for energy security
However overreliance on Russia for a strategically vital commodity widens the divergence of interests between members like Germany that share a privileged partnership with Russia and those like Poland that consider the Kremlin a threat
Much as Austria alignment with Germany drove the Slavs to seek Russian patronage at the expense of imperial unity European alignments with Russia drive the new members to seek US patronage at the expense of EU unity
As AustriaHungary discovered once geopolitical dependency starts the dominant power will seek to use the dependent ally as an extension of its own interests rather than see it regain freedom of maneuver
While the EU is unlikely to ever achieve independence from Russian energy it can improve its ability to cope with dependence by finding what AustriaHungary lacked a source of leverage to maintain the relationship on relatively equal terms
This means above all establishing a united voice on energy
In the end many who fought to bring about AustriaHungary demise would live to mourn its passing as subsequent events would show the old empire was still more of a necessity than they realized
By learning from its mistakes today Europeans may yet be able to reform and reinvigorate an mpire whose most important work still lies ahead
Europe Bad Trade Gamble
PARIS  The start of negotiations for a freetrade agreement between the European Union and the United States  officially called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership TTIP  marks a key turning point for EU and world trade
It also reinforces both sides shift away from multilateral trade policy in recent years
That might be the right move for America but it could spell serious trouble for Europe
Over the past halfcentury the EU which represents only  of the global population has managed to maintain an exceptionally strong trade position despite the rise of emerging markets like China
So while the US and Japan have seen their respective shares of global exports fall the EU share has remained stable at around 
Indeed EU trade power contrasts sharply with the perception of a weakened Europe
Most important Europe was able to achieve it only by investing heavily in a multilateral trade system through the GATT and then the World Trade Organization
And yet while the EU owes much to the multilateral trade system since  it too has shifted to bilateralism scoring its biggest successes with freetrade agreements with Latin America and South Korea
An agreement with Canada is now within reach though bilateral negotiations with India seem to have stalled probably because the Indians do not believe that a freetrade agreement would help them much
Officially the EU considers a bilateral approach to trade to be perfectly compatible with a return to multilateralism
But the facts belie this
First it is clear that bilateralism is growing as multilateralism wanes
Since  when the WTO Doha Round of global freetrade talks collapsed the Europeans have proved unable to bring the US China and India back to the multilateral negotiating table
More important they evidently have given up trying
This is reflected in the EU reluctance to press emerging countries to become parties to the WTO multilateral Agreement on Government Procurement as if it has accepted that this issue can be resolved only bilaterally
Moreover since  US trade policy has deliberately abandoned multilateralism in order to pursue containment of China via a twopronged strategy the planned TransPacific Partnership TPP and the TTIP
The reason for this change is simple The US no longer has the power to set the rules of the global trade system but it considers itself strong enough to work around them
The EU partly shares America strategic objective here because it too has grievances against emerging powers in terms of market access compliance with intellectualproperty rights access to government procurement and subsidies to state companies
But Europe must avoid alignment with this new and narrow US trade focus for several reasons
First Europe does not have an Asian strategy or TPP equivalent
Granted an agreement between the EU and Japan would be very beneficial to Europe and would diminish America advantages in Asia
But if the US concludes the TPP before the Europeans secure an agreement with Japan the Japanese government bargaining power visvis the EU would automatically increase
In this sense for both the US and Europe agreement with Japan will be the key measure of bilateralism success or failure
Second and more fundamentally the US is a politicalmilitary power in addition to being an economic power
As a result its partners trade calculus will always be shaped by strategic considerations which are not a factor for them when dealing with Europe
This is especially relevant with respect to China
The US very clearly wants to check China by raising global trade standards
But if broader geopolitical considerations brought these two countries to an agreement Europe could suffer
Something akin to this happened during the climatechange conference in Copenhagen in  where the US and China decided to oppose a comprehensive global agreement effectively dismissing Europe
Likewise the US has no real interest in revitalizing multilateral trade negotiations because bilateralism is much more effective in extracting concessions from emerging powers
Europe has neither the same geopolitical interests as the US nor more important the same means which implies that it has a greater stake in revitalizing multilateral trade
Indeed the proliferation of bilateral agreements with their own mechanisms for resolving differences will inevitably weaken the WTO disputesettlement mechanism further undermining multilateralism
The need to revive multilateralism is all the more important given that EUUS negotiations will likely be difficult and prolonged owing especially to resistance from European and American regulators
European regulators have already decided to tighten conditions for authorizing genetically modified organisms as if to show US trade negotiators that they will not move easily from cherished positions
Now that the TTIP talks have officially been launched Europe must try to obtain the best terms that it can
Above all the EU must accept that global trade is a merciless political game played according to a paramount rule keep all of one options open at all times

Focal Point
The EU vs Democracy
ROME  One of the ways in which the European Union effectively asserts the fundamental values of democracy and the rule of law is through its External Cooperation Programs whereby on the invitation of local authorities it provides support in the form of electoral assistance projects and election observation missions
So during the course of the EU sent election observation missions to various countries including Mozambique Afghanistan Guinea Bissau Lebanon Malawi and Bolivia
Just this month the European Parliament sent observers to Ukraine presidential election
At the end of each mission a couple of days after the election the Head of Mission who is normally a member of the European Parliament first issues a preliminary report on the election and on the handling of the electoral process followed by a final report a few months later
On December  last year Evo Morales was reelected President of Bolivia with more than  of the popular vote
In her preliminary statement the EU Head of Mission MEP Renate Weber stated that the electoral process had in general terms adhered to international standards with respect to democratic elections and that the Bolivian Electoral Commission had acted in a transparent neutral and efficient way
But the preliminary report also included some criticism that irked the Bolivian administration
In particular the report stated that the country sharp political polarization was highly visible in the media in particular on Bolivian television stations
In fact while opposition candidates were given fair exposure on private TV and radio the EU Head of Mission observed various cases in which their statecontrolled counterparts privileged the government parliamentary candidates
For example Bolivia TV devoted  of its news bulletinsto the government party candidates whereas the seven opposition parties combined mustered only a  share This according to Weber amounted to an buse of institutional propaganda
I believe that it is important that the EU carries out such monitoring in nonEU statesBut what about elections in EU member states
Shouldn what is good for the goose also be good for the gander
I have in mind the two countries of which I am a citizen Italy and Malta where the media situation is an absolute disaster
More or less everybody is acquainted with the situation in Italy where Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi not only owns the three major private TV stations but as the head of government also anages indirectly at least two of the three stateowned TV channels
Media manipulation has become the order of the day in Italy but unfortunately the EU behaving on the premise that it will not interfere in internal matters refuses to say a word about any of this
The situation is even worse in the smallest EU member country MaltaThere the only two political parties represented in parliament since independence in  have ganged up to ensure for themselves an oligarchic duopoly on anything that goes on in the country
The political leaders of the Nationalist Christian Democratic Party and the Labor Party have enacted a law whereby since  they alone share more than  state financing
Not content with this the two parties passed a law in  that gave each of them  and no other parties  a national TV station
Getting greedier by the day they then decided to share on a  basis both the National Electoral Commission and the National Broadcasting Authority
Nor have they shrunk from constitutional tinkering in order to lock in their power
Indeed they have changed the constitution three times since  to ensure that every vote for the Nationalist Party and the Labor Party is given a higher weighting than votes received by any of the country other political parties when it comes to translating votes into parliamentary seats
All of this is happening not in some remote country far removed from civilization
It is happening in an EU member state
When will the EU intervene to stop this internal rot
The Euro At the Crossroads So Soon
ROME Six weeks into the Euros life Europes economic policies are out of whack
Europe has high public debts taxes near  of national product and years of high unemployment and mediocre growth
So whats the response
A tilt toward monetary rigidity and an expansive fiscal policy through a creeping abandonment of the EU Stability Pact
In addition proposed employment strategies will do little to reduce labor market rigidity
Europe craves the opposite mix more monetary flexibility fiscal policies that reduce taxation and national debt and a labor policy that makes Europes labor markets more akin to Americas
These three cardinal policies are related
Monetary Policy
The European Central Bank ECB pursues price stability defined as annual inflation of around 
At this delicate moment in the world economy the ECB is seeking to establish its antiinflation credibility at the very moment when the spectre of deflation is appearing for the first time in halfacentury
Debtors worldwide face a risk of bankruptcy which if widespread could lead to a dangerous recession
The ECBs choice strangely focuses more on its own antiinflation posture than deflation
Compare European monetary policy with American actions
Americas Fed follows a rule of monetary policy whereby the prime objective of controlling inflation permits according to precise parameters a reaction to changes in the rate of growth
This policy works leading to a long period of stable uninterrupted growth
The ECB should follow a similar course
So what should be the objective regarding inflation
Price growth of say  per annum instead of  has clear additional costs but may facilitate the adjustment of relative prices and wages across Europe
This does not mean that collective bargaining agreements do not take into account inflation but only that at a micro level a little inflation permits more flexibility in relative real wages
Fiscal Policy
Europe must reduce the deadweight of debt and taxes
How
By reducing primary expenses then reducing taxes
But European politicians of right and left believe that public expenditures are the engine of growth
Wrong economies grow with more markets not with more public expenditures
Ireland the European country with the highest rate of growth is also the one that most reduced its deficit and public debt by cutting expenditures and taxes
Elsewhere in Europe there is talk about abandoning the Stability Pact before the Pact even goes into effect
For example we no longer hear about cutting Italys public debt in half in relation to GDP
In fact Italys government was among the first to support the idea of jettisoning the Stability Pact and had to be rebuked by the EU Commission for over optimistic budget projections
Germany too has traveled far from its antiinflationary obsessions
Minister Lafontaine seems to love inflation and public debt without thinking about the consequences
Frances socialist government continues to believe despite contrary evidence that a vast centralized public sector is compatible with a dynamic market economy
Widespread ideas about major public investments financed by bloating deficits should be forgotten
Public infrastructure investments displace private investments and the taxes necessary to finance them introduce further distortions in demand
In any case the lions share of public expenditures goes to pensions transfers and public sector salaries
Without drastic reform of the social state European fiscal policy will continue to have feet of clay
Labor Policy
Every few weeks European ministers proclaim new initiatives concerning labor policy
Most are useless
The only employment policy that makes sense reduces fiscal burdens on the cost of labor and increases flexibility in the market
Consider this in Italy in the last  years the cost of each job is equal to  of the average salary the average in other countries of EMU is around  the same number for the United States is around 
These numbers tell only part of the story
Increases in income taxes imply that unions demand higher gross salaries in order to compensate for the fall in net salaries due to tax increases
Therefore income taxes in part impact the cost of labor contributing to high unemployment
In fact average unemployment in the countries of the EU in the last  years is around 
Today it is still high while in the US it was around  and is now 
Europe is trapped in a vicious circle those employed recoil from more flexibility and the risk of losing their jobs
But unemployment is high because of taxes and excessive protection for those employed which prevents the market from creating new employment opportunities
So the unemployed ask for more social protection instead of flexibility increasing the fiscal drain on the economy
Given lax fiscal discipline the ECB will likely react with more monetary rigidity pushing politicians already enamored with the social state to spend and tax even more
Europe and the euro face a crossroads
One road is where the ECB digs in its heels on price stability and politicians forget about fiscal discipline and the fact that a market economy cannot work with half of GDP absorbed by taxes
Such a combination would force the ECB to be even more rigid in an economy where the employed and their representatives trade unions are preoccupied exclusively with protecting existing jobs and excluding outsiders ie the unemployed
The other road reduces the fiscal burden of the social state reinvigorating the economy by reducing taxes and providing the employed not with social protection but with more assurance of finding another job if they lose their current one
If Europe takes this road monetary policy could help by assuring the minimal stabilization of cyclical fluctuations without having to keep nominal interest at too high a level
The first road is that of eurosclerosis the second takes the best of what the US can teach Europe
The Euro Monetary Unity To Political Disunity
SAN FRANCISCO  A common currency is an excellent monetary arrangement under some circumstances a poor monetary arrangement under others
Whether it is good or bad depends primarily on the adjustment mechanisms that are available to absorb the economic shocks and dislocations that impinge on the various entities that are considering a common currency
Flexible exchange rates are a powerful adjustment mechanism for shocks that affect the entities differently
It is worth dispensing with this mechanism to gain the advantage of lower transaction costs and external discipline only if there are adequate alternative adjustment mechanisms
The United States is an example of a situation that is favorable to a common currency
Though composed of fifty states its residents overwhelmingly speak the same language listen to the same television programs see the same movies can and do move freely from one part of the country to another goods and capital move freely from state to state wages and prices are moderately flexible and the national government raises in taxes and spends roughly twice as much as state and local governments
Fiscal policies differ from state to state but the differences are minor compared to the common national policy
Unexpected shocks may well affect one part of the United States more than others  as for example the Middle East embargo on oil did in the s creating an increased demand for labor and boom conditions in some states such as Texas and unemployment and depressed conditions in others such as the oilimporting states of the industrial Midwest
The different shortrun effects were soon mediated by movements of people and goods by offsetting financial flows from the national to the state and local governments and by adjustments in prices and wages
By contrast Europe common market exemplifies a situation that is unfavorable to a common currency
It is composed of separate nations whose residents speak different languages have different customs and have far greater loyalty and attachment to their own country than to the common market or to the idea of Europe
Despite being a free trade area goods move less freely than in the United States and so does capital
The European Commission based in Brussels indeed spends a small fraction of the total spent by governments in the member countries
They not the European Union bureaucracies are the important political entities
Moreover regulation of industrial and employment practices is more extensive than in the United States and differs far more from country to country than from American state to American state
As a result wages and prices in Europe are more rigid and labor less mobile
In those circumstances flexible exchange rates provide an extremely useful adjustment mechanism
If one country is affected by negative shocks that call for say lower wages relative to other countries that can be achieved by a change in one price the exchange rate rather than by requiring changes in thousands on thousands of separate wage rates or the emigration of labor
The hardships imposed on France by its franc fort policy illustrate the cost of a politically inspired determination not to use the exchange rate to adjust to the impact of German unification
Britain economic growth after it abandoned the European Exchange Rate Mechanism a few years ago to refloat the pound illustrates the effectiveness of the exchange rate as an adjustment mechanism
Proponents of the Euro often cite the gold standard era from  to  as demonstrating the benefits of a common currency
But the gold standard also had its costs
The period was characterized by declining prices from  to  rising prices thereafter and sharp fluctuations within each period especially severe in the s
The standard was viable only because governments were small spending in the neighborhood of  percent of the national income rather than  or more percent as now prices and wages were highly flexible and the public was willing to tolerate or had no way to moderate wide swings in output and employment
Take away the rosecolored glasses and it was hardly a period or a system to emulate
As of today a subgroup of the European Union  perhaps Germany the Benelux countries and Austria  come closer to satisfying the conditions favorable to a common currency than does the EU as a whole
And they currently have the equivalent of a common currency
Austria and the Benelux three have to all intents and purposes linked their currencies to the Deutschmark
However these countries still retain their central banks and hence can break the link at will
Any country that wishes to link to the Dmark more firmly can do so on its own simply by replacing its central bank with a currency board as some countries such as Estonia outside the EU have done
The drive for the Euro has been motivated by politics not economics
The aim has been to link Germany and France so closely as to make a future European war impossible and to set the stage for a federal United States of Europe
I believe that adoption of the Euro would have the opposite effect
It would exacerbate political tensions by converting divergent shocks that could have been readily accommodated by exchange rate changes into divisive political issues
Political unity can pave the way for monetary unity
Monetary unity imposed under unfavorable conditions will prove a barrier to the achievement of political unity
The EuroAmerican Debt Dilemma
PALO ALTO  Wealthy Europe and America crown jewels of mixed capitalist democracies are drowning in deficits and debt owing to bloated welfare states that are now in place Europe or in the making the United States
As Europe struggles to prevent financial contagion and America struggles to reduce its record deficits their dangerous debt levels threaten future living standards and strain domestic and international political institutions
The ratings agencies are threatening additional downgrades others envision an eventual breakup of the euro andor demise of the dollar as the global reserve currency
The economists Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart estimate that public debtGDP ratios of  are associated with sharply diminished growth prospects
Greece debt ratio is over  Italy is around  and the US is at  up from  a few years ago  and rapidly approaching 
The International Monetary Fund estimates that each point increase in the debt ratio lowers economic growth by  percentage points
Thus increases of  of GDP risk cutting longrun growth in half in parts of Western Europe and by onethird in America  a devastating reduction in gains in living standards over the course of a generation
Worse yet the burden of banking losses that will sooner or later be socialized and that of future unfunded public pension and health costs are often understated in official debt figures
Moreover the problematic finances of some subnational governments for example in the US and Spain will place pressure on central governments for fiscal aid
In Europe voters in fiscally responsible countries like Germany and the Netherlands are balking at bailouts of governments banks and bondholders
American voters traditionally have favored smaller government and lower taxes than Europeans have favored or at least tolerated
Add continued anger over financial bailouts rising spending and the exploding national debt and even America Democrats  the country traditional bigspending party  are finally talking deficit reduction
Following the last deep American recession in  when the unemployment rate peaked at a higher level than in the recent recession Democrats blasted President Ronald Reagan for deficits of  of GDP
Republicans now berate President Barack Obama for deficits of  of GDP
Similar political and substantive jockeying occurs in European countries
The simplistic categorization of political parties by their preference for a particular size of government masks more complex intraparty tendencies
America Republican Party has three types of fiscal conservatives supplyside taxcutters those who would limit government spending and budget balancers
They historically have feuded over tactics and strategy but since the deficit is the difference between revenues and outlays they are closely interconnected
Indeed because the sum of all future tax revenues discounted to today must cover the sum of all future spending plus the national debt the only way to keep taxes relatively low is to control spending
Just as Democrats have long championed more government spending and more benefits for more people either on ideological grounds or as a political coalitionbuilding strategy so Republicans have regarded the goal of lowering taxes
So not surprisingly Republicans are using the vote on the debt ceiling to force cuts in entitlement spending while Obama and Congressional Democrats are using it to force higher taxes in part to fracture their opponents coalition
High levels of debt combine with slow economic growth in a devilish dance
Interest payments on the debt eventually become so burdensome that bondholders demand higher interest payments Greek debt recently yielded over 
Interest rates on US government debt remain low so this threat is prospective but future deficits will be far higher than government projections when rates normalize
The best response would be to enact strong controls on budgets together with structural reforms to promote growth
In the US which has the most progressive income tax among the major economies federal tax reforms that would lower the rates and broaden the base are being discussed
In Europe structural reforms focus on higher retirement ages and labormarket flexibility
The deleveraging of governments financial institutions and households is one major cause of the sluggish economic recovery
But sluggish growth means less tax revenue and more demands for payments to cushion hardship placing pressure on government budgets
The gamble has been that a solid durable recovery would enable banks and households to rebuild their balance sheets quickly enough to avoid the need for additional bailouts
But so far that gamble isn working as well or as rapidly as hoped
Banks are profitable on an ongoing basis borrowing at very low interest rates often from the central bank and collecting higher interest rates on their loans
But while instantaneous marktomarket accounting can overstate the expected losses during a panic the current values are often an accounting and political fiction
Further action on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac America huge quasigovernment mortgage agencies and on some weak banks in America as well as on some of Europe weaker more thinly capitalized banks the recent stress tests were a tepid first step will be necessary
Banking systems need more capital
The best solution is private capital  from retained earnings new entrants new ownership and new investment
But in some cases additional public capital probably cannot be avoided as distasteful as it is
The debt dilemmas in Europe and the US prove yet again that elected officials will ignore longrun costs to achieve shortrun benefits and will act only when forced in a doomed effort to circumvent the laws of economics and revoke the laws of arithmetic
And that implies an extended period of episodic economic disruption and political upheaval far beyond this summer debates on America debt ceiling and Europe distressed sovereign debtors
These debates represent just one round in an ongoing struggle with vast political and economic consequences for years to come
The Euro and Europeus Welfare State or How the Eu
SAN FRANCISCO Hidden behind the euros falling exchange rate is a lifeanddeath struggle between it and Europes welfare state
Either the euro subverts the welfare state or Europes welfare state will subvert the euro
Despite todays weakness smart money should bet on the euro
The euros disappointing performance  falling from a value of a  at its inception to a recent low below   is in large part due to Europes reluctance to adopt structural reforms to increase economic flexibility
ECB Chief Economist Otmar Issing writes Germany and other European Union countries share the blame for the euros weakness because they failed to make their economies more flexible
But there is a world of difference between the euros need to tame the welfare state and its ability to do so
Harvard economist Martin Feldstein indeed believes that the single currency will be a political impediment to reform
Politicians writes Feldstein can now blame the ECB for high unemployment and complain that it is a powerful force beyond national control
Another more likely outcome exists if anticompetitive policies pursued by a country sink the euro they will be condemned as antiEuropean
For Europes political leadership the euro is a sine qua non  an experiment that cannot and will not be allowed to fail
If shortsighted national economic policies threaten the euro they will spark powerful countervailing political pressures on offending parties to cease and desist
The recent VodafoneMannesmann merger is an example here
When Britains Vodafone signaled its intention to takeover Germanys Mannesmann Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder protested against the merger on grounds that it would cost German jobs
The euro fell in value with this news
ECB Chief Wim Duisenberg responded brilliantly pinning an AantiEuropean tail on the German donkey by proclaiming that the euro was threatened by Schroeders anticompetitive actions
Unwilling to be labeled antiEuropean Schroeder backed down
Besides equating welfare state policies with antiEuropeanism the euro will spark reform by forcing EU member governments to compete to attract mobile capital
The euro increases capital mobility inside Europe by eliminating exchangerate risk on intraEuropean transactions
No longer trapped in a single country by fears of adverse currency movements firms can relocate anywhere within the eurozone
That means they can bargain with member governments to get the best deal possible on taxes government regulations and labor rules
To encourage companies to locate in the Netherlands for example the Dutch are willing to bargain on taxes
Belgium and Denmark have passed businessfriendly laws and regulations
This race to the bottom in anticompetitive measures will spark a corresponding race to the top in European growth rates
The result can only strengthen the euro
Europes left saw this coming and is trying to squelch government competition by using the European Commission to harmonize European taxes regulations and labor standards at high anticompetitive levels
Former German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine tried and failed to use this tax harmonization ploy to trap German capital in hightax Germany
Brussels is said to be taking aim at the Netherlands to harmonize away its competitive concessions
In addition to EU harmonization some European politicians propose restrictions on internal EU market activity to fend off the race to the bottom
At the recent Lisbon EU summit Nicole Fontaine President of the European Parliament asserted that ruthless exploitation of the disparities between social and fiscal legislation in member countries justified restrictions on corporate takeovers
Such talk only adds to the euros woes
Not all European leaders attribute the euros weakness to structural factors
Some think the US dollars strength against the euro reflects the fact that America and Europe are at different stages in the business cycle
Once the US slows down and Europe picks up the euro will do better
But Europes economy has been stronger than Japans yet the euro has fallen dramatically against the yen as well as the dollar
Other knowledgeable European voices point to the fact that the DM hit alltime highs against the US dollar when Germanys structural problems were even more severe than at present
But the DM is not the euro
In the past German Bundesbank enjoyed a credibility gap visvis the Federal Reserve
Today the ECB suffers a credibility gap visvis the Fed
In the past foreign exchange markets paid less attention to structural factors
Today an economys ability to compete in a globalized economy is paramount to how foreign exchange markets value a currency
This is particularly true for the euro as the currency of the New Europe
If the New Europe fails so will the euro
Once Europes political leaders recognize their failure to make necessary reforms is threatening not only the euros foreign exchange value but also its existence reforms will be made and the euro will soar
The Euro and European Prices
Among the hopedfor effects of the Euros physical arrival are an increased transparency of the differences in retail prices between different EMU countries and a subsequent pressure to equalize these prices
The argument for the latter is simple with national currencies eliminated and everything priced in Euros how can similar cars or loaves of bread have different prices on either side of a border
Pressures will be formidable to buy where prices are low and sell or at least not to buy where prices are high
That argument however is naive for it does not take a genius to compare the price of a car in Germany with the price of the same car in France
Everybody makes such calculations when they decide where to take vacations abroad so why believe that they do not do it for other goods and services
People are not as stupid or lazy as politicians and bureaucrats think
The interesting question is this how much are price discrepancies due to sheer ignorance and inertia and how much are they due to factors that are unlikely to change with the Euros arrival
Start with the evidence on retail prices
UBS the Swiss banking group prices a standard basket of  goods and services in various cities around the world
For European cities the results are listed in the table below which uses Germany as the benchmark
Obviously huge price differences exist if people in Finland were to do their shopping in Spain they would increase their purchasing power by 
So if price equalization were to happen citizens in rich countries would feast and those in poorer countries would pay through the nose
But that wont happen price level differences will not change much the Euro notwithstanding
The UBS survey shows that prices in Frankfurt are  higher than in Berlin
Prices in Houston Texas to use prices in a similar unitary monetary area the US are  less than in NY and somewhat less than in Los Angeles
Both differences matter because they show that price equalization does not occur simply because a common currency exists
What then is behind lasting differences in prices within and between countries
There are three important factors
anticompetitive practices
Of course free trade exists in principle but there are often important snags at borders and within countries
In America for example it is illegal to ship wine privately from California to Massachusetts because wine wholesalers in Massachusetts managed to have a Federal law established that protects their huge profit margins
What would be easy arbitrage using the Internet and delivery services gets stopped in its tracks by trade organizations and manufacturers who convince legislators andor bureaucrats to protect their monopoly rents
In Europe anticompetitive practices are rampant
If the EU is serious about creating one market plenty of work remains to be done
differences in competition and scale
The smaller the market the fewer the number of distributors that can serve it profitably
But the fewer the number of distributors the less competition there is
So margins become fatter and prices higher
Often competition is limited by regulations that fragment markets but sometimes it is a matter of it being unprofitable to arbitrage to say bring in your croissants from Belgium each morning
retail prices
The critical point here is that a retail price includes not only the price of the goods but also distribution costs  wages of shop personnel rent advertising profit margins etc
These differ vastly across countries as the table suggests
There are no big productivity differences between Finland and Portugal when it comes to standing behind a counter selling stockings
Yet wages are vastly different and hence we expect lower retail prices in poorer cities and countries than in richer ones
New York versus Houston makes that point just as well as France versus Greece
What goes for wages also goes for other distribution costs
In principle the entire Eurozone forms a single market but that is not how things work out in practice
There is a famous saying in America that all politics are local
The same is true of prices
A survey of the cost of grooming a poodle in the Greater Boston Area conducted by Harvards Kennedy School of Government revealed price differences in excess of 
A surprise
Of course not pet grooming is expensive in rich parts of Boston and cheap in poor parts just as haircuts are
What is the upshot here
Price divergences are here to stay
The Euro will do little to change that
Over time there will be a tendency for these divergences to be compressed but that wont be a result of the Euro
It will arise from Brussels the spread of webbased buying habits and the emergence of EUwide retail distribution
When all is said and done however European prices will look as they do in the US where large divergences exist a century after free trade and a common currency were established between the states
The Euro and the Dollar
PARIS Oskar Lafontaines resignation has only brought a brief respite to the Euro
Its weakness will now continue
If things keep going as they are going the Euro will soon stand at a value of less than one euro to the dollar
This is a threshold fraught with symbolism within just a few short months of its birth the strong euro that its architects seemed to prophecy will have transformed itself into a weak euro
All sorts of old wounds will inevitably open up if the euro falls so far so soon
Many European inferiority complexes toward America which the advent of the euro were supposed to banish forever could easily reappear
In Paris the suggestion is growing that Washington must be made to stabilize exchange rates between the main currencies in particular the eurodollar exchange rate
Replace the euro with the French franc and the dollar with the DM and the discussion evokes a strong feeling of dj vu
So one must now again repeat some old truths that many Europeans seem to be deliberately forgetting
Just as the strong franc the socalled franc fort of the s did not imply an economically strong France a strong euro should not be equated with an powerfully growing Europe
The exchange rate is a price not a score in the last game of the World Cup
Like all other prices it must sometimes increase sometimes decrease according to market demands
It is true of course that exchange rates are different from many other prices in that they are directly influenced by central bank policies
As a result the Federal Reserve Bank and the European Central Bank do possess the means to stabilize the exchange rates
But it would be a grave mistake to embark on that course
Stabilization of exchange rates implies an aggressive targeting of interest rates
Intervening on the currency markets without altering interest rates  a measure economists call a sterilized intervention  would affect the exchange rate for a few minutes at the most for a few days
Americas Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan is choosing the dollars interest rate to stand as a function of what is happening in the United States
The ECB is choosing the euro interest rate as a function of what happens in Europe
Both choices are good things
So long as the two central banks behave this way and as the two regions are subjected to highly different choices which as a matter of fact will be so indefinitely American and European interest rates will each continue to evolve on different paths and their exchange rates will keep fluctuating
This is what is currently happening
The risk of drifting into a recession is larger in Europe than it is in the United States
As a result in the coming year interest rates are far more likely to fall in Europe than they are in the United States
The eurodollar exchange rate mirrors this anticipated change
A lower valuation for the euro diminishes the risk of recession in Europe
Once again this is good news for Europeans
To stabilize the euros rate at this stage would be equivalent to a European Central Banks announcement that it prefers stabilizing the euro at a higher value to avoiding recession
Alternatively from the other side of the Atlantic to keep the eurodollar exchange where it now is would be tantamount to the Feds declaring that in spite of an unemployment rate as low as  it will decrease interest rates and perhaps revive the corpse of inflation
Both strategies would be idiotic
Fortunately both are unlikely to happen never mind that I have more confidence in the Fed than in the ECB
Therefore the Fed and the ECB must continue to tend to their own shops and leave it to the currency markets to set the exchange rate
Does this mean that the worlds two great central banks should not only be passive but mute
No silence is a bad idea
There is no need to remind ourselves that currency markets occasionally lose their cool and that exchange rate movements are at times totally disconnected from the real economy if not from reality itself
Here is where central banks in particular the ECB can play an important role as carriers and disseminators of information
They can indicate  in the austere language that is so much their speciality  that it is time for currency traders to come back to reality
Can they succeed
Alan Greenspans attempts to talk and cajole the American stock market down to earth from what he called irrational exuberance are not quite reassuring on that account
Perhaps he was too reserved but such efforts are the responsible course for todays two great central banks
The Euro Ark
BRUSSELS  The euro is celebrating its tenth anniversary against the background of the most difficult economic climate since its birth
The financial storm that swept in from the United States and the onset of a severe economic downturn confronts Europe with unprecedented challenges
Faced with the biggest test in its history the euro is far from steering into disaster as the Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman predicted ten years ago
On the contrary Europe Economic and Monetary Union is proving a major asset in these tumultuous times 
Doubters should remember that the euro was itself born out of crisis
The single currency was conceived as an answer to the upheavals of the postwar period  doubledigit inflation high unemployment and speculative attacks on the pound the lira and the French franc
It was the crisis of the European Monetary System that drove the euro launch on January   
In ten short years the euro revolutionized the global economic environment rising to the status of the world second currency and rivaling the dollar as a medium for international trade and finance
The EMU is now the world largest market and continues to grow
With Slovakia entry on January  the euro spans  countries and  million citizens
The benefits of a monetary union based on a stable macroeconomic framework and governed by an independent central bank are manifest the euro area has enjoyed low inflation and low interest rates for much of the last decade a boost in trade and investment and rapid integration of financial markets
Moreover  million jobs have been created over the last  years  a record more successful than even the US 
Today financial turmoil and economic downturn are highlighting the EMU advantages in several important ways
First the euro has eliminated the possibility of exchangerate turbulence and speculative currency attacks that more vulnerable economies could have expected in the current turmoil
As a stable and strong world currency the euro is also limiting exchangerate instability globally
Second the euro area benefits from an independent European Central Bank whose swift actions to ease liquidity constraints and coordinate monetary policy have recently helped to avert a financial meltdown
Such rapid coordinated steps by  national central banks would have been unthinkable
Third the EMU stabilityoriented macroeconomic framework has better prepared euroarea countries for economic storms
Thanks to the fiscal rules of the Stability and Growth Pact the euro area achieved its soundest budgetary position in  bringing deficits to their lowest levels in  years
This allowed many European Union countries to approach the crisis with room for maneuver
Such are the EMU benefits that the visible costs of remaining a nonmember are beginning to recast the political debate surrounding euro adoption in several countries 
Of course the euro is no panacea nor has it functioned perfectly over the last decade
Divergences between euroarea economies in terms of growth and inflation have been a persistent challenge
Though differences are no bigger than those found within larger economies such as the US or Germany they risk being amplified by the crisis 
This is why it is even more important that we continue to improve the EMU functioning
This requires not just reinforcing resilience in the face of crisis but also equipping euroarea economies for the longerterm challenges of globalization aging resource scarcity and climate change
In a potentially more volatile twentyfirst century global economy we must reap the maximum benefits of economic integration in terms of growth and jobs 
The key to a better functioning EMU is closer surveillance and deeper coordination of economic policies
Leaders must start living up to the responsibilities that come with sharing a single currency
They must recognize the impact that national economic policies have on the euro area as a whole and thus discuss and coordinate economic programs at the euroarea level
Here the launch of the European Economic Recovery Plan  the initiative for an EUwide fiscal stimulus equivalent to  of GDP endorsed by the European Heads of Government in December  constitutes a major step forward
This must now be followed by closer budgetary monitoring particularly given that fiscal stimulus measures the economic downturn and bank rescue plans will take a toll on public finances
The Stability and Growth Pact must remain the cornerstone of the EU budgetary framework and effective surveillance and peer support will be vital to help member states work towards balanced budgets once the economy rebounds 
Deeper fiscal surveillance should be matched by broader economic surveillance especially since currentaccount imbalances have become more acute during the crisis
The European Commission is now working on extending the focus of surveillance beyond fiscal policy so that we can identify risks stemming from macroeconomic imbalances or changes in competitiveness and address them before they become entrenched
Finally euroarea nations must strive harder to find common positions on international issues and to speak with a single voice in the global arena
This is the only way to promote and defend the EMU economic interests in a world where the challenges are global and overcoming them will increasingly depend on multilateral cooperation 
Consider November international summit on the financial crisis
Agreeing a common position ahead of the meeting gave Europe a greater role
When the euro area manages to agree swiftly on a coordinated position this can be instrumental to finding agreement in the EU as a whole and internationally
It is vital we now build on this success and develop a genuine international strategy for the euro
The European single currency has been a major success but it remains a work in progress
A decade after the euro introduction we must follow the example of its founders and turn crisis into opportunity by uniting in a spirit of cooperation and ambition  and thereby reinforce the EMU foundations
The Euro at MidCrisis
CAMBRIDGE  Now that the European Union and the International Monetary Fund have committed  billion to rescue Ireland troubled banks is the eurozone debt crisis finally nearing a conclusion
Unfortunately no
In fact we are probably only at the midpoint of the crisis
To be sure a huge sustained burst of growth could still cure all of Europe debt problems  as it would anyone
But that halcyon scenario looks increasingly improbable
The endgame is far more likely to entail a wave of debt writedowns similar to the one that finally wound up the Latin American debt crisis of the 
For starters there are more bailouts to come with Portugal at the top of the list
With an average growth rate of less than  over the past decade and arguably the most sclerotic labor market in Europe it is hard to see how Portugal can grow out of its massive debt burden
This burden includes both public debt owed by the government and external dent owed by the country as a whole to foreigners
The Portuguese rightly argue that their situation is not as dire as that of Greece which is already in the economic equivalent of intensive care
But Portugal debt levels are still highly problematic by historical benchmarks based on my research with Carmen Reinhart
With a baseline scenario of recession or sluggish growth amid budget austerity for years ahead Portugal will likely seek help sooner rather than later
Spain is a more difficult case
The central government is arguably solvent but a significant chunk of municipal and provincial bank debt seems underwater
The big question in Spain is whether as in Ireland the central government will allow itself to be gamed into taking on private and also municipal debt
Here again history gives no cause for optimism
It is very difficult for a central government to sit on the sidelines when the economy key players are on the brink of collapse
But bailouts for Portugal and Spain are only the next  and not necessarily final  phase of the crisis
Ultimately a significant restructuring of private andor public debt is likely to be needed in all of the debtdistressed eurozone countries
After all bailouts from the EU and the IMF are only a temporizing measure even sweetheart loans after all eventually must be repaid
Already facing sluggish growth before fiscal austerity set in the socalled IGS Portugal Ireland Greece and Spain face the prospect of a ost decade much as Latin America experienced in the 
Latin America rebirth and modern growth dynamic really only began to unfold after the  rady plan orchestrated massive debt writedowns across the region
Surely a similar restructuring is the most plausible scenario in Europe as well
It sometimes seems that the only eurozone leader who is willing to face the likely prospect of future debt restructuring is German Chancellor Angela Merkel
The Germans have been widely castigated for pointing out that Europe has no clear mechanism for sorting out sovereign government defaults and that surely it needs one
Many pundits would have one believe that Ireland would have pulled through unscathed absent Germany blundering statements
That is nonsense
With huge private debts falling house prices and external claims on Ireland amounting to more than  times national income according to the ReinhartRogoff database there was never going to be an easy way out
Allowing European debt problems to fester and grow by sweeping them under the carpet through dubious theatrics can only make those problems worse
Indeed only last July the eurozone made a big show of its financial tress tests of its banks giving almost all of them including in Ireland a clean bill of health
Denial is a not a useful policy for dealing with a financial crisis
Europe debt problems should in fact still be quite manageable  provided the requisite writedowns and debt restructurings are implemented
Here is where the latest Irish bailout is particularly disconcerting
What Europe and the IMF have essentially done is to convert a privatedebt problem into a sovereigndebt problem
Private bondholders people and entities who lent money to banks are being allowed to pull out their money en masse and have it replaced by public debt
Have the Europeans decided that sovereign default is easier or are they just dreaming that it won happen
By nationalizing private debts Europe is following the path of the  debt crisis in Latin America
There too governments widely uaranteed privatesector debt and then proceeded to default on it
Finally under the  Brady plan debts were written down by roughly  four years after the crisis hit full throttle
Most postmortems of the Latin American crisis suggest that all parties would have been far better served had they been able to agree on partial debt forgiveness much earlier
Latin America might have returned to growth far sooner than it did
Creditors might even have received more in the end
As European policymakers seek to move from one stage of denial to another perhaps it is time to start looking ahead more realistically
As any recovering alcoholic could tell them the first step is admitting with Merkel that Europe has a problem
The Euro at Ten
PALO ALTO  The beginning of  will long be remembered for terrible economic news and controversial economic policy in virtually every country
It also marks the th anniversary of the euro the common currency further knitting together several hundred million Europeans in their economic and financial affairs
It is worth pausing to commemorate this remarkable event and the effect the euro existence has had on the current global crisis
The euro was launched in January  for a complex set of economic financial political and historical reasons
It was the final icing on the cake of the plan by many postWorld War II leaders driven by the memory of two horrible world wars originating in and consuming Europe in the previous halfcentury to forge closer economic and political ties
Ten years ago there were real concerns about launching the new currency
Would people give up their old national currencies and use the new euro
Would it maintain its value against the dollar
Launched at  it plunged to almost  early on then rose peaking at nearly  in  before falling back to around 
When a group of individual currencies is replaced by a single currency as the Deutsche mark French franc Italian lira Spanish peseta and others were by the euro there are two primary benefits lower transaction costs and greater transparency
Having neither the cost and inconvenience of constant currency transactions nor the uncertainty that arises from fluctuations among currencies is a boon to the common currency area
And pricing of goods and labor throughout the currency area which previously had different exchange rates becomes much more transparent
The cost of cellphone minutes in Italy for example is much more easily compared to those in Germany or France
These twin benefits complement the scale advantages of freetrade areas
Europe is still realizing the full potential of these benefits but struggling with natural crossborder mergers and the failure or replacement of prominent national companies by better competitors from other countries
Many proponents of the euro claimed that it would quickly evolve as an alternative reserve currency alongside the dollar or even replace it in global markets
Most of world trade is still invoiced in dollars but the euro has gradually emerged as a viable alternative  a strong currency backed by the hardearned inflation credibility of the European Central Bank
What then of the costs
Why don all nations join currency areas or why not create a single global currency as Nobel laureate Robert Mundell suggests
One obvious reason is that there are also disadvantages to a common currency area
Suppose that southern Europe is hit much harder by today recession than northern Europe An economy has two potential ways to adapt to and mitigate its downturn
First its currency would naturally depreciate making exports more competitive and imports more expensive
This partially cushions the downturn
Alternatively labor could migrate from highunemployment southern Europe to lowerunemployment northern Europe
The United States offers an important example of such labor mobility
In the early  when US unemployment reached almost  many workers moved from the socalled Rust Belt  the hardesthit industrial area of the upper Midwest  to other parts of the country
In the early  when California had a more severe recession people sought jobs in neighboring states
Labor migration operated as a safety valve against even worse unemployment
Labor migration in Europe is historically far less extensive
Many don want to abandon the deep roots they have in their home regions others don want to move to another country where language and culture may be obstacles
With limited labor mobility and the euro removing the other shock absorber exchangerate adjustments great pressure will fall on those countries with the worst downturns
This has led some economists to question whether the euro zone is a good idea at all and to predict that when confronted with a test of a severe differential recession it will break apart
Low inflation no currency risk decreased transaction costs and greater transparency have made the euro a success
But the decreased flexibility in response to economic shocks will certainly test it
At present it is boldly highlighting the disparate even discordant fiscal responses now being embraced by European Union governments
This raises the old question about whether a currency union can work without a fiscal union or at least stronger and more binding fiscal rules the Maastricht deficit commitments are too easily breached
To that we must add coordinated financial regulation and bailout policies as deposits flow rapidly across borders in response to national guarantees and insurance in the euro zone
Will the euro second decade be as successful as the first
The financial crisis and deepening recession have created many challenges
The euro zone less competitive economies are tethered to monetary policy interest rates set by the ECB but pursue diverse approaches to bank bailouts and fiscal stimulus
Italy and Greece in particular face serious debt issues amid financial market concerns about the possibility of default or their leaving the euro zone
The gaps between German bond yields and Italian and Greek yields are at record levels
The price of default insurance has tripled
But the weaker economies get the inflation credibility of the ECB and protection from severe exchangerate swings
Indeed avoiding continuous competitive devaluations is more a blessing than a curse
On balance that may even make membership more appealing for nonmembers such as Denmark and Poland
The Euro Awaits Its Verdict
WASHINGTON DC  The creation of the euro just over a decade ago was a courageous and unique experiment
Today the outcome  whether the euro will survive and whether the Europeans are right to keep it  is very much in doubt
But if the eurozone does survive it promises great advantages for member countries  and perhaps for the world
The euro is an ultrafixed currency among members participating countries locked themselves into an initial exchange rate visvis their preexisting currencies and then threw the keys into the long grass
Nowadays an increasing number of Europeans are combing that grass quietly looking for those keys
The euro shares important features with versions of the old gold standard under which countries fixed their exchange rates relative to each other by setting the price at which domestic currency could be redeemed in gold
Today some people espouse the view  often loudly  that the gold standard was synonymous with economic and financial stability
But that is completely at odds with the historical record the era of the gold standard is replete with boombust episodes fueled by overborrowing by governments firms individuals or all of the above
There are three differences between the euro and the gold standard  none of which is particularly reassuring at this moment
First the gold standard central premise was a finite quantity of gold in the world more of it cannot be created or discovered at least not quickly
By contrast the European Central Bank can create more euros if so desired
Countries cannot run out of liquidity because the ECB can always provide more cash
But governments and investors know this and the result has been much higher debttoGDP ratios than would have been possible under the gold standard
The eurozone as a whole has a debttoGDP ratio of  which is high by any standard
Such debt levels are sustainable as long as investors continue to assume that another bailout is just around the corner
But if the ECB is threatening to cut off support  for example because a government will not comply with what the Germans regard as good economic policy  the whole house of cards can come tumbling down
Second financial markets have become huge relative to anything seen under the gold standard
European banks could bulk up in large part because it was assumed that their respective governments backed them
Not only are these banks now large relative to some national economies but the quality of government credit is now in question across the eurozone periphery  up to and including Italy
The term iskfree asset has become an oxymoron in contemporary Europe
European banks have been operating on a great deal of debt and very little shareholder capital  the essential buffer against potential losses
Any shock to sovereign debt or further downturn in local economies will be transmitted through an overleveraged and undercapitalized banking system to other European countries and  quite possibly  elsewhere including the United States
Finally for all the talk today of the discipline that the gold standard supposedly provided countries that adhered to it regularly suspended convertibility  meaning that the domestic currency could no longer be converted freely into gold
But today Europeans have no domestic currency  just the euro
If any country  for example Greece  left the euro all contracts in that country would have to be rewritten
The disruption particularly to credit would be profound
The proper functioning of the gold standard required a high degree of flexibility in wages and prices
If exchange rates cannot depreciate wages and prices need to fall when a country has an unsustainable currentaccount deficit
But as peripheral Europe can now attest this is a cumbersome painful and politically unpopular form of economic adjustment
Expect the backlash against it to grow in the months and years ahead
The news focus today is on how hard it is for the eurozone periphery to adjust and return to growth owing to the combination of high public debt and actual or perceived austerity measures
But there is a flip side to the problem capital is flowing to Germany as the regional safe haven making credit more readily available there
The dynamics of adjustment within the eurozone exacerbate the underlying imbalances  Germany is becoming more competitive while the periphery remains uncompetitive
The recent Greek elections have brought more radical parties to the fore
Alexis Tsipras the head of the Coalition of the Radical Left has a valid pointnbspnternal devaluation  cutting wages and prices  is failing as a strategy
His alternative appears to be to abandon the euro
If Greece can do better than this he argues then it should leave
But this is not about Greece any longer
Italy Spain Portugal and even Ireland face the same issues but are at an earlier stage in the backlash
Unemployment is rising their economies are not becoming more competitive and the interest rates on their debt continue to rise
These countries may eventually decide to leave
And even if they don make that choice fear of such exits can easily become selffulfilling
The euro system was designed to deliver prosperity and stability for all
It has clearly failed for some countries and it may fail for many
Severe mismanagement by European politicians has caused damage that will last for decades
Perhaps a stronger fiscal union a central ministry of finance and debt sharing would reduce the difficulties and imbalances enough to allow the euro to survive
Perhaps adjustment will start to work just in time
There is a lot of shouting in the jury room
Expect a verdict soon
The Euro Catalyst
PARIS  In  shortly after the launch of the euro I wrote a book arguing that countries adopting the common currency should be forced in one way or another to implement structural reforms
Ten years later where do we stand
Surprisingly the first country to reform was Germany
Thanks to an environment favorable to exportoriented firms and most notably to wage discipline Germany began to post significant balanceofpayment surpluses
This is evident today on a dramatic scale and is sustaining German economic growth and one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe
The story is markedly different in other eurozone members
The IIGS Portugal Italy Ireland Greece and Spain greatly benefited from the euro thanks not only to the removal of currencyrelated trade barriers but also because their interest rates suddenly fell to levels unthinkable in preeuro times
Furthermore because these countries no longer faced currentaccount constraints they could spend beyond their means without any immediate apparent damage to their economies
With this artificial boost to their economic growth they had little incentive to press ahead with unpopular reforms in line with the European Union Lisbon agenda
Then came the global crisis
During these hard times  the euro usefulness and the eurozone resilience were welcomed the world over
Only during the exit from the crisis did problems begin to surface
The size of public debts which had been ballooning in many countries during the crisis together with growing competitiveness gaps between member states began worrying markets
Some investors doubtful of the sustainability of some countries public debt began to worry about the viability of the euro itself
Reactions to this perilous momentum came without delay
At the European level there has been a swift and impressive mobilization of resources
And EU President Herman van Rompuy is preparing a framework for enhanced fiscal surveillance prevention and resolution
As Jean Monnet one of the ounding fathers European integration presciently observed in his memoirs  years ago he European construction is moving ahead during crisis and it will be the sum of the solutions brought about in order to overcome them
No one can deny that structural reforms are currently underway in all eurozone countries that have been struck by the crisis
Suddenly reform became une imprieuse obligation if not  given the pressure of financial markets  a matter of outright survival
Consider Greece the eurozone member in the most acute predicament
Reforms of the labor market the pension system and those underway or planned in many sectors and professions  all of which generate huge reserves for enhanced growth and therefore hope  reflect a profound change in the public perception of the country longterm needs
Indeed despite endemic social unrest a large majority of Greeks acknowledges the need for change and does not oppose it
Euroskeptics will say that it is not the euro but the crisis itself that has catalyzed reform
To be sure the euro alone has not been a sufficient trigger
But given past European experience there is serious reason to doubt that in the absence of the euro the crisis alone would have provided the necessary impetus
Before the euro a country facing a publicfinance crisis would have been forced into a predictable hopeless sequence devaluation of its currency followed by inflation which alleviated the publicdebt burden
It wasn long before it was back to usiness as usual with hardly any structural reform
How many Greek crises after all paved the way to Greece current crisis
Competitive devaluation which skeptics are calling for must be avoided this time around
Eurozone members facing a loss of competitiveness can no longer afford to skirt difficult but necessary reforms through a monetary uick fix that shifts the burden onto their trade partners as always beggarthyneighbor policies reward laxity and penalize virtue
As for the structural reforms now underway or in the planning stage the most important question is not whether the euro the crisis or a combination of the two brought them about but whether they will succeed
Clearly failure would impose huge political costs that leaders will be impelled to take all necessary steps to avoid
They already have shown remarkable determination providing grounds to be optimistic that this time things will indeed be different
Is the Euro Crisis Over
BRUSSELS  Financial crises tend to start abruptly and end by surprise
Three years ago the euro crisis began when Greece became a cause for concern among policymakers and a cause for excitement among money managers
Since the end of  a sort of armistice has prevailed
Does that mean that the crisis is over
By the usual standards of financial crises three years is a long time
A year after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September  confidence in the United States financial system had been restored and recovery had begun
A little more than a year after the  exchangerate debacle triggered Asian economies worst recession in decades they were thriving again
Has the eurozone at long last reached the inflection point
Many battles were fought in the last three years  over Greece Ireland Spain and Italy to name the main ones
The European Union financial warriors are exhausted
Hedge funds first made money betting that the crisis would worsen but then lost money betting on a eurozone breakup
Policymakers first lost credibility by being behind the curve and then recouped some of it by embracing bold initiatives
Recent data suggest that capital has started returning to southern Europe
The current change in market sentiment is also motivated by two significant policy changes
First European leaders agreed in June  on a major overhaul of the eurozone
By embarking on a banking union which will transfer to the European level responsibility for bank supervision and ultimately resolution and recapitalization they showed their readiness to address a systemic weakness in the monetary union design
Second by launching its new utright monetary transactions scheme in September the European Central Bank took responsibility for preserving the integrity of the eurozone
The OMT program was a serious commitment and markets interpreted it that way especially as German Chancellor Angela Merkel backed it despite opposition from the Bundesbank
Moreover Merkel visited Athens and silenced the voices in her coalition government who were openly calling for Greece exit from the euro
Unfortunately however there remain three reasons to be concerned about the future
For starters politics lags behind economics which in turn lags behind market developments
Sentiment on trading desks in New York or Hong Kong may have improved but it has deteriorated on the streets of Madrid and Athens
Indeed the economic and social situation in southern Europe is bound to remain grim for several years
As things stand all southern European countries are facing the prospect of a true lost decade according to the International Monetary Fund their per capita GDP will be lower in  than it was in 
As long as sustained economic improvement has not materialized political risk will remain prevalent
Political upheaval in any of the southern countries would be sufficient to reignite doubts about the eurozone future
Furthermore French competitiveness and the gap between its performance and that of Germany is a growing cause of anxiety
The second reason to worry is that there is limited consensus in Europe on what exactly is needed to make the monetary union resilient and prosperous again
Banking union is a positive development but there is no agreement on additional reforms such as the creation of a common fiscal capacity or a common treasury
In particular northern Europe continues to interpret the crisis as having resulted primarily from a failure to enforce existing rules especially the EU fiscalstability criteria
Southern Europe is more inclined to view the crisis as having resulted from systemic flaws
Furthermore northern Europe regards austerity as the mother of all reforms while southern Europe fears that governments may not have enough political capital to do everything at the same time
Finally the last three years have revealed a clear pattern in the management of crises Almost no decision results from serene deliberation with most taken under financialmarket pressure in an attempt to avoid the worst
Each time the pressure abates plans for policy reform are put off an attitude best captured in Merkel famous ultima ratio action is undertaken only if it is indispensable to the survival of the euro
In other words Europe displays a strong sense of survival but not a strong sense of common purpose
None of this means that the euro will collapse
The widely held conviction that letting the monetary union break up would amount to collective economic suicide provides a strong motivation to weather storms and overcome obstacles
Moreover the results achieved so far may well prove sufficient to contain risks in the near future while plans for a fiscal capacity common bonds and the creation of a European treasury are still being sketched
So in practical terms the difference between reforms that could be implemented and those that are being or will be implemented is less significant than it seems
But by consciously eschewing discussion about which reforms would make membership in the eurozone less hazardous and more beneficial for all European leaders are missing an opportunity to signal that the euro is a stepping stone toward a prosperous resilient and cohesive union and they are missing an opportunity to signal that the harsh economic adjustment that continues to dominate the policy agenda for much of the continent is not an end in itself
The Euro Grows Up
On January  the euro celebrated its sixth birthday
Today we look back on a period in which the European Central Bank has successfully pursued a stabilityoriented single monetary policy serving more than  million citizens
This is a remarkable achievement
When the Maastricht Treaty was ratified in  many people doubted whether Economic and Monetary Union would work
The Treaty objective was widely thought to be laudable  but realizable only in the indefinite future
To the surprise of many Europe demonstrated great determination to ensure that the single currency became a reality 
A single monetary policy for a currency area comprising   and later   countries each with a sovereign national government was something entirely new
Would it be compatible with autonomous national fiscal policies
Given the decentralized nature of the system would national interests distort the conduct of monetary policy 
I see several reasons underlying the ECB success in implementing a supranational monetary policy  and thus in firmly establishing the euro stability
First the ECB mandate  enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty  is to deliver and maintain price stability
Focusing on the goal of maintaining a low and stable rate of inflation is the best contribution that monetary policy can make to economic welfare sustainable growth and job creation 
Second the Treaty made the ECB perhaps 
 the 
 most independent central bank in the world
The political temptation is always there to resort to inappropriate monetary expansions that bring temporary relief at the expense of harming longerterm growth
Institutional independence has allowed the central bank to conduct its monetary policy in a consistent manner insulated from shortterm political influences
Admittedly the ECB first years were a aptism of fire
Blessed at the start with a very low inflation rate in the euro area the common currency soon faced a series of oneoff shocks
The biggest impact initially came from sharply rising oil prices and later from a rapidly weakening exchange rate which led to a sharp rise in import prices
By the end of  oil prices had risen to levels not seen since the beginning of the 
These shocks were naturally beyond the ECB control
The policy response however required preventing these shocks from becoming entrenched in medium to longterm inflation expectations
In this context  and in view of the robust economic growth recorded in  and  the stillbooming stock markets and the continued accumulation of excess liquidity  the ECB Governing Council progressively tightened policy thereby keeping upward risks to price stability from materializing
A bigger challenge came with the protracted stock market slowdown the terrorist attacks on the United States in  and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq
These events hindered the global economy by thwarting confidence and momentum
Another period of excessive pessimism arose a year ago
In the summer of  public debate and market sentiment in the euro area were influenced by Japan protracted deflation and the expectation of a possibly severe disinflationary process in America
Some observers saw a risk of sustained deflation in the euro area as well 
Our assessment was different
Inflation in the euro area was then slightly above 
Given the movements in the euro exchange rate in previous months and sluggish growth in the euro area we expected that inflation rates would decline but only to levels close to 
Indeed our monetary analysis suggested that the risk of protracted deflation was negligible
So we did not overreact
We continued to guide monetary policy by our assessment of the risks to price stability over the medium term
This mediumterm orientation paid off
Fears of euroarea deflation soon vanished and an incipient recovery started later in 
Several lessons can be learned from these episodes
First in all cases we remained clearly focused on the mandate of price stability
Second we kept a steady hand guided by our mediumterm orientation while eschewing oversimplified diagnostics and mechanistic reactions to a few indicators
Third we aimed at guiding markets and inspiring confidence in monetary policy thereby helping to stabilize the economy by keeping inflation expectations anchored at levels compatible with our definition of price stability
So the brief history of the ECB monetary policy is already a success story
Most of the initial uncertainties and concerns  and to a large extent the skepticism  have been dispelled
A still relatively young institution  and the common currency that it manages  has quickly gained public and global confidence
A current indicator is that the world central banks are holding an increasing share of their foreignexchange reserves in euros rather than US dollars
 
The main question now is whether the ECB will be able to sustain its hardwon reputation following enlargement of the euro zone in coming years
Indeed when the ECB was established some observers raised concerns even then about possible inefficiencies resulting from its supposedly outsized Governing Council and about possible distortions in its deliberations due to national considerations
However these concerns were misplaced
So are concerns about the effect of further enlargement of the euro area
The voting rules unanimously approved by the Governing Council and adopted by the European Council in early  have prepared the ECB well
All Governors whatever their voting rights will continue to attend meetings of the Governing Council and to participate fully in its discussions
Furthermore the ne member one vote principle will remain valid and apply to all members exercising a voting right
Thus the voting system is sufficiently robust to accommodate up to  euroarea members 
Moreover the new voting system is transparent and above all automatic thereby reinforcing the ECB independence
This will facilitate the conduct of monetary policy by reducing uncertainty and bolstering credibility still further
As the world has learned credibility and reliability are the ECB two most important attributes
The Euro in a Shrinking Zone
LONDON  The recent European Union summit was a disaster
Both Britain and Germany played the wrong game British Prime Minister David Cameron isolated Britain from Europe while German Chancellor Angela Merkel isolated the eurozone from reality
Had Cameron brought an economicgrowth agenda to the summit he would have been fighting for something real and would not have lacked allies
As it was he fully accepted Merkel austerity agenda  which his own government is implementing independently  and chose to veto proposals for a new European treaty to protect the City of London
This cheered up the Euroskeptics in Cameron Conservative Party but it offered nothing to counter the lethal medicine prescribed by Germany Iron Lady
The agreement reached in Brussels forecloses any possibility of Keynesian demand management to fight recession
tructural budget deficits would be limited to  of GDP with as yet undisclosed penalties for violators
This is the wrong cure for the eurozone crisis
The Merkel doctrine holds that the crisis is the result of government profligacy so only a ard balancedbudget rule can prevent such crises from recurring
But Merkel analysis is utterly wrong
It was not deficit spending by governments that fueled the economic collapse of  but excessive lending by banks
Government mounting debts have been a response to the economic downturn not its cause
What ought to have been hardwired into the EU institutional structure was not permanent fiscal austerity but tough financial regulation
Of this there is little sign
More immediately important is the failure of the proposed iscal union to do anything for European recovery
The figures are grim before the summit the European Central Bank slashed its eurozone GDP growth forecast for  from  to 
That is almost certainly optimistic
In fact the eurozone will contract in the first half of next year  and probably in the second half because of the deficitcutting policies now being pursued  placing further pressure on banks and sovereigns
The reason why recovery from the crash of  has been so anemic is straightforward
When an economy shrinks government debt grows automatically because its revenues decline and its expenses rise
When it cuts spending its debt grows even more because its cuts cause the economy to shrink further
This makes the government more not less likely to default
In the eurozone most government debt is held by private banks
As this debt increases the value of banks assets falls
So the crisis of the sovereigns engulfs the banks
To put weakened governments on iron rations as Merkel did was to make a financial crisis inevitable
To continue to preach salvation through austerity as the economy declines and banks collapse is to repeat the classic mistake of German Chancellor Heinrich Brning in 
To be sure the eurozone needs more than a bailout
The periphery needs to recover competitiveness and some have taken heart from the Mediterranean countries shrinking trade deficits  the structural trade imbalances within the eurozone are correcting themselves they say
Unfortunately these corrections are not based on increased exports but on declining imports owing to depressed levels of economic activity
The idea that a country can achieve a trade surplus by importing nothing is as fanciful as the idea that a government can repay its debt by starving itself of revenue
One person spending is another person income
In insisting that its main trade partners cut their spending Merkel is cutting Germany off from the main sources of its own growth
So will the single currency survive
Two policies that might in combination save it are off the agenda
The first is quantitative easing printing money on a heroic scale
The ECB should be empowered to buy any amount of Greek Italian Spanish and Portuguese government bonds needed to drive down their yield to near the German rate
This might stimulate real growth through several channels by reducing lending rates by raising the nominal value of public and private assets and by weakening the euro against the dollar and other currencies
But the effects of quantitative easing on economic activity are uncertain and such an inflationary policy might well invite retaliation from Europe trading partners
That is why quantitative easing should be run in conjunction with a eurozonewide investment program designed to modernize the creaking infrastructure of eastern and southern Europe
Capital spending by governments unlike current spending can be selffinancing through user charges
But even if it is not wellchosen public investment produces high returns new roads reduce transportation costs and new hospitals produce a healthier workforce
An institution the European Investment Bank EIB already exists to carry out such a program
It should be recapitalized on a sufficient scale to offset the contractionary effects of Europe national deficitreduction programs
Quantitative easing combined with public investment would impart the growth impetus that the eurozone sorely needs to bring about a gradual reduction in its aggregate debt burden
But it is almost certain that neither policy much less both will be implemented
The ECB is stealthily buying government bonds on the secondary market but its new governor Mario Draghi insists that such intervention is temporary limited and intended solely to estore the functioning of monetary transmission channels
No one at the recent EU summit suggested making the EIB an engine of growth
So the bleeding will go on
This means that the eurozone is beyond saving the euro will survive but the zone will shrink
The only question is the scale timing and manner of its breakup
Greece and probably other Mediterranean countries will default and regain the freedom to print money and devalue their exchange rates
This will send shock waves throughout the world
But sometimes shock waves are needed to break the ice and start the water flowing again
The Euro is Coming
The Euro Crisis of Democracy
FLORENCE  In the end as always Europe acted
But will it be enough
Financial markets no doubt will be skeptical about the eurozone members solemn commitment that the de facto Greek default will remain the exception
Verbal assurances have been the European Union preferred currency in tackling the euro crisis but words now have as little value as Greece sovereign debt
It took more than a year for Europe to do what everyone knew needed to be done to contain the Greek crisis and it still may not be enough For the approved measures do not provide the transparent and longterm commitment to restoring Greek finances that markets want to see
That is the nature of European politics
The EU acts only when it is pressed to the wall
And when it finally does do the right thing it pretends not to be doing it
The reason is that European Union politics is mostly national politics which addresses national issues with a European dimension but not European issues
The EU deep interdependence is lost in national politics opening a gap between the scope and level of policies and where politics takes place
Europe democratic deficit is less a gap between European institutions and European citizens than between national politics and European problems
Consider the very different narratives that have emerged in Europe and the United States about the financial crisis
Both in the US and the EU some spent more than they could afford and others granted credit that they ought not to have granted
But Americans blame irresponsible banks while Europeans blame irresponsible southern countries like Greece
The reason for this disparity is the scope and level of the politics under which the narratives are framed
In the US the problem is seen as a national problem regarding the actions of banks and individuals while in Europe the problem is seen as one arising within some states and affecting other states
Quite simply EU politics has not kept pace with the scope and level of the Union problems
This is what the EU democratic deficit really means No EU member state has yet to fully internalize the consequences for their democracy of the interdependence generated by integration
A few eurozone members financial troubles have become a problem for all
An immigration influx into Italy spills over into other EU countries
A wrong assessment by German authorities of the health risk posed by a particular vegetable leads to massive financial losses for farmers across Europe
In all these instances national policies have had severe repercussions for other EU states
European issues were governed at a national level and other Europeans paid the price
At the same time because the EU is both a source of wealth creation through market integration and of redistributive effects among states through competition in that market its decisions increasingly majoritarian character requires some democratic notion of distributive fairness
To the extent that European issues can still be fully governed by European politics national politics need to be made more European
A credible solution to the eurozone current crisis depends on addressing this democratic deficit but the crisis also provides an opportunity to do so
Reform of the eurozone governance must use democratic mechanisms  and the logic of the internal market  to prevent some EU states from imposing externalities on others
But the democratic argument must also be applied to the other side of the issue adjustment programs
Once the EU binds its aid to some states to their adoption of certain policies it should be equally accountable for the outcome of those policies
Democratically addressing the consequences of financial interdependence requires both a European voice on individual states policies and a correspondent European democratic accountability
The EU can simultaneously address the markets fears
It should make clear that the results of the full implementation of those policies are guaranteed by the Union  for example by making the issuing of eurobonds conditional on the full implementation of the adjustment programmes
The EU must also be made accountable not only for what it spends but also for the wealth that it generates
It must distribute ts money and not that of its members
The democratic argument requires a clear connection between the Union financial resources and the wealth that it generates or with member states economic activities that have important externalities for other members
The European Commission recent proposals for EU own revenue sources are a step in the right direction
Any new VAT resource should be linked to crossborder transactions establishing a clear link with the internal market
Other revenue sources could be linked to national activities with substantial crossborder externalities
If the way that the EU raises money is made more democratic deciding how to spend that money would become more democratic too
This is crucial to ensure the legitimacy of the eurozone economic governance
The Euro Final Countdown
The introduction of the euro in  it was claimed would narrow the economic differences between the member countries of the monetary union
Unemployment rates would converge as would other important macroeconomic variables such as unit labor costs productivity and fiscal deficits and government debt
Ultimately the differences in wealth measured in terms of income per capita would diminish as well
After the common currency first decade however increased divergence rather than rapid convergence has become the norm within the euro area and tensions can be expected to increase further
The differences between member states were already large a decade ago
The euro became the common currency of very wealthy countries such as Germany and the Netherlands and much poorer countries such as Greece and Portugal
It also became the currency of the Finns runnersup in innovation and market flexibility and of Italy which lacked both earning the apt moniker he sick man of Europe
Such differences were a highly complicating factor for the newly established European Central Bank ECB which had to determine the appropriate interest rate for all members the socalled ne size fits all policy
The larger the differences have become during the euro first decade the more the ECB policy could be described as ne size fits none
We have compared the performance of the bestperforming and worstperforming eurozone countries between  and 
To avoid comparing apples and oranges we have compared the data for the  countries that were included in the first wave in  supplemented by Greece which joined shortly thereafter
All data are from Eurostat the European statistics bureau
Because the ECB was given the sole task of achieving and maintaining price stability in the euro area inflation rates seem the most logical starting point for comparison
In  the difference between the eurozone countries with the lowest and highest inflation rate was two percentage points
By the end of  the difference had almost tripled to  percentage points
As for economic growth we have made an exception
For that variable we looked at the average yearly GDP growth in the first five years after the introduction of euro banknotes and coins in 
The difference between Ireland and Portugal in the first half of the decade was  percentage points
By  it had increased to six percentage points
Moreover the productivity difference increased from  index points in  to  in  the difference in unit labor costs went from  percentage points to  and the difference in the unemployment rate rose from  percentage points to 
Nor could we find any convergence regarding government deficits and debt
In  Finland boasted the smallest government debt equal to  of GDP
The difference with the largest debtor in the euro area Italy was  percentage points
Despite the most severe financial and economic crisis in almost a century the Finnish national debt actually decreased by  to 
Italy meanwhile failed to use the significant windfall from the steep decline in longterm interest rates caused by the introduction of the euro and a decade of rapid economic growth to repair its debt position
Italy debt barely budged and stayed well above  of GDP
As a result the difference between the debt positions of Finland and Italy the most prudent and most profligate eurozone members shot up to  percentage points in 
The situation is even worse for government deficits
The implications of these increasing differences could be severe
Increasing tensions between the euro countries on economic policy are likely as are growing rifts within the ECB governing council in the coming years
We might get a sneak preview this year and in  when European leaders must select a new ECB president and vicepresident
As always those seats will be hotly contested but with more at stake than ever the fight for them could be fiercer than it would otherwise
Tensions at the ECB and between the eurozone countries do not bode well for the stability of the common currency both externally visvis other currencies and internally in terms of inflation
The ECB will be scapegoated for that
If it keeps its interest rate too low for too long countries like Germany and the Netherlands will protest
If it hikes the interest rate the southern eurozone countries will complain
In any case support for the euro already fragile will erode further weakening the common currency and fueling even greater tensions
In  the Italian singer Toto Cutugno won the annual Eurovision song contest with his passionate call to Europeans to unite
The refrain of his winning song ogether  was nite unite Europe
Almost  years later the Swedish band Europe hit song he Final Countdown seems more appropriate for the euro area with every passing day
The Euro Greek Tragedy
AMSTERDAM  When the euro was introduced in  European countries agreed that fiscal discipline was essential for its stability
While the common currency has benefited all countries that have adopted it  not least as an anchor in the current economic crisis  the failure of eurozone members to abide by their agreement risk could yet turn the euro into a disaster
Indeed too many members simply behave as if there were no Stability and Growth Pact
The state of Greek public finances for example is  concern for the whole euro zone according to European Commissioner for Monetary Affairs Joaquin Almunia
Greece fiscal deficit is expected to reach  of GDP this year far exceeding the SGP ofGDP cap
Of course every eurozone country is breaching the SGP deficit ceiling as a result of the current crisis
But consider the Netherlands which will do so this year for only the second time since 
When the Netherlands first exceeded the SGP limit  by only  of GDP  the government immediately took tough measures to rein in the deficit
Germany and Austria behaved the same way
Those countries are already working to reduce their crisisinflated deficits as soon as possible
Down in southern Europe things look very different
Exceeding the SGP deficit cap is the rule rather than the exception
Indeed throughout the euro first decade Greece managed to keep within the SGP limits only once in  and by a very narrow margin
Moreover the Greek government turned out to be untrustworthy
In  Greece admitted that it had lied about the size of its deficit ever since   precisely the years used to assess Greece application to join the euro zone
In other words Greece qualified only by cheating
In November  it appeared that the Greek government lied once again this time about the deficit in  and the projected deficit for  
Italy also has a long history of neglecting European fiscal rules as do Portugal and France
Like Greece Italy was admitted to the euro zone despite being lightyears away from meeting all the criteria
Public debt in both countries was well above  of GDP compared to the SGP threshold of  of GDP
Italy did not fulfill another criterion as well as its national currency the lira did not spend the mandatory two years inside the European Exchange Rate Mechanism
Ten years later it seems as if time has stood still down south
Both the Greek and Italian public debt remain almost unchanged despite the fact that both countries have benefited the most from the euro as their longterm interest rates declined to German levels following its adoption
That alone yielded a windfall of tens of billions of euros per year
But it barely made a dent in their national debts which can mean only one thing massive squandering
That is evident from their credit ratings
Greece boasts by far the lowest credit rating in the euro zone
Standard amp Poor has put the already low A rating under review for a possible downgrade
Fitch Ratings has cut the Greek rating to BBB the thirdlowest investment grade
Indeed those scores mean that Greece is much less creditworthy than for example Botswana and Malaysia which are rated A 
What if Greece gets into so much trouble that it cannot service its debt
That is not impossible
According to calculations by Morgan Stanley with relatively low longterm interest rates Greece needs a primary surplus of at least  of GDP each year just to stabilize its national debt at  of GDP
Current European rules prohibit other European countries or the EU itself from helping Greece
But recent history teaches us that European rules are made to be broken
Already many former politicians and economists no prizes for guessing whence they mostly hail are proposing that the EU issue its own sovereign debt which would alleviate the problems of countries such as Greece and Italy 
But such schemes would come at a high cost
They would punish fiscally prudent governments as interest rates would inevitably increase in countries like the Netherlands or Germany
Just a  increase in borrowing costs would mean hundreds of millions of euros in extra debtservice payments a year
Moreover even if the plan for EU sovereign debt never takes off fiscally prudent eurozone countries will face higher borrowing costs
As financial integration in Europe deepens the lack of fiscal discipline in one or more eurozone countries will push up interest rates throughout the currency area
A member of the euro zone cannot be expelled under current rules allowing countries like Greece to lie manipulate blackmail and collect more and more EU funds
In the long term this will be disastrous for greater European cooperation because public support will whither
Europe should therefore consider bearing the high shortterm costs of changing the rules of the game
If expelling even one member could establish a more credible mechanism for guaranteeing fiscal discipline in the euro zone than the SGP and financial fines have proven to be the price would be more than worth it
The Euro Hard Rain Falls
SWEDEN  The blame game is in fashion as crisis and desperation spread across Europe
News reporting as well as political and economic debate now focuses on identifying the culprits with bankers and politicians emerging as the prime suspects
Bankers are blamed because their irresponsible lending and speculation brought about the fall of economies like Ireland and Latvia as well as deep trouble in countries like Spain and Portugal
Politicians are blamed because they did not tighten fiscal policies when needed in order to prevent property bubbles rein in external deficits and avert economic overheating
Now after the bubbles have burst and the property market inevitable collapse has been followed by that of banks public finances and labor markets the villains must be punished
But this popular exercise is beside the point
It is obvious that politicians and bankers made grave errors that contributed to the current crisis
But regardless of how bad Europe political and financial leaders may seem a sudden rise in the number of incompetent or immoral individuals throughout the eurozone periphery is not a credible explanation of this crisis
The people running Ireland and Latvia were praised as role models just a short time before they became scapegoats
Instead the blame should be shared by those who knew or should have known about the risks of giving up the ability to set interest rates in individual countries
We know that extremely low real interest rates produce massive expansion of credit
In countries with higher price growth than in Germany but with the same borrowing costs this cannot produce anything but overheating higher inflation and even lower real interest rates
To stem this flood of creditinduced demand with fiscal policy alone is impossible and it is absurd to try
How do you tighten fiscal policy to make up for more than  of GDP in creditinduced spending power in only three years as occurred in Ireland in   and in a democracy sporting a fiscal surplus as Ireland is
To ask politicians in a democracy with big surpluses to raise taxes or cut benefits or public investment by the enormous magnitude needed to stave off disaster strikes is to be out of touch with reality
Quite simply the risks for small peripheral countries are inherent in the system created by the European Monetary Union
The main blame should therefore be put on the system founders or those who saw the problems coming but chose not to raise a word of warning
The dream of European unity evidently induced some to remain silent in an effort to preserve the euro project visionary goodwill
Now we have awakened to an existential crisis for the common currency
Neglecting the risks and exaggerating the benefits of the euro in order to promote shortterm support for it inevitably became selfdestructive
Those who not only tolerated but actively encouraged the excesses of countries like Latvia  by making eventual euro adoption a precondition for European Union membership and promising that it would produce only growth prosperity and discipline  are those who should be chased by the blame game
Every economy needs someone who can ensure that the proverbial punch bowl is taken away when the party gets out of hand
This is what independent central bankers are for and that is why their independence from political interference has been enshrined in the European Treaty
But this insight is not reflected in monetary union design
Smaller members of the eurozone particularly those on its periphery and with weaker economic links to the heartland of the EMU become vulnerable to overheating and inflation when their ability to raise interest rates is abolished
No provisions in the Treaty address this fundamental problem
Many are now suffering as a result
The Euro Imagined Community
NEW HAVEN  Great significance  probably too much  has been attached to a possible breakup of the eurozone
Many believe that such a breakup  if say Greece abandoned the euro and reintroduced the drachma  would constitute a political failure that would ultimately threaten Europe stability
Speaking before the Bundestag last October German Chancellor Angela Merkel put the matter starkly
obody should believe that another halfcentury of peace and prosperity in Europe is guaranteed
It is not
So I say If the euro fails Europe fails
That must not happen
We have a historical obligation to protect by all prudent means at our disposal Europes unification process begun by our forefathers more than fifty years ago after centuries of hatred and spilling of blood
None of us can foresee what the consequences would be if we were to fail
Europe has had more than  wars since the beginning of the Renaissance in the midfifteenth century
So it is not alarmist to worry aloud about preserving the sense of community that Europe has enjoyed for the past halfcentury
In a fascinating but largely overlooked book How Enemies Become FriendsCharles A Kupchan reviews many historical case studies of how nationstates with a long history of conflict managed eventually to become secure and peaceful friends
His examples include the formation of the Swiss Confederation  the creation of the Iroquois Confederation in the century or so before the first Europeans arrived in America the establishment of the United States  the unification of Italy  and of Germany  the NorwaySweden rapprochement  the formation of the United Arab Emirates  and the ArgentineBrazilian rapprochement of the 
Kupchan also examines some notable failures of friendship the United States Civil War  the end of the AngloJapanese Alliance  the breakdown of SinoSoviet relations  the demise of the United Arab Republic  and the expulsion of Singapore from Malaysia 
Kupchan never mentions a common currency as a condition of comity among nations in fact economic integration tends to follow rather than precede achievement of political unity
Rather he regards diplomatic engagement as the essential element to strategic accommodation and mutual trust and this is more easily accomplished if the states have similar social orders and ethnicities
But Kupchan analysis implies that a common currency can help nationstates to build lasting friendships for he argues that friendshipbuilding is most secure after an identitychanging arrative takes root leading to a sense that the nations are like members of a family
A common currency can help to generate such a narrative
For example the Iroquois tell the story of a great warrior and skilled orator named Hiawatha who traveling with the mystic Deganawidah negotiated the treaties that established their confederation
He advocated new condolence ceremonies to commemorate lost warriors  and to replace wars of vengeance
The new narrative was reinforced with physical symbols akin to a currency or a flag in the form of belts of beads made of wampum the Iroquois money
A surviving Hiawatha belt dating from the eighteenth century and probably a copy of earlier belts contains symbols of the five nations  Seneca Cayuga Onondaga Oneida and Mohawk  much as the US flag contains stars representing each of its states
The belt also preserves Hiawatha status as the confederation forefather
Flags may be a more inspiring symbol of common destiny but most of us do not carry them around and many people never display them except perhaps at major sports events their origin rooted in battle standards can seem uncomfortably aggressive
There is a European Union flag but it is rarely seen anywhere but outside of EU government buildings
A British schoolteacher expressed the sentiment well in  e suspect the man who talks patriotism and imperialism just as we suspect him who talks religion or any of the things that are of deepest value in life
We think him either a humbug or a shallow person who has not realized the inadequacy of words to express what is deepest
And yet national currency which we display every time we make a cash purchase arouses no such suspicions
So currency works as a constant if latent reminder of identity
In using it one has the psychological experience of participating with others in a common venture and thus developing a sense of trust in both the endeavor and one fellowparticipants
Every currency union chooses symbols of common cultural values for its coins and notes and these symbols become part of the sense of shared identity
We see the human faces on the notes so often that they come to seem like family creating what the political scientist Benedict Anderson called the magined community that underlies and sustains a sense of nationhood
The euro notes feature bridges as they appeared throughout Europe in various epochs rather than images of actual structures that might seem to imply preferential regard for some countries
The town of Spijkenisse in the Netherlands is now in the process of building all seven bridges depicted on the euro notes
But the bridges remain symbols of European culture in which presumably all Europeans share
Modern electronic technology will not eliminate paper notes and coins soon so there is still plenty of time to make use of the symbolic value of a common currency
Indeed even if the eurozone breaks up each European country could adopt a different currency but retain common symbols
For example there could be a Greek euro a Spanish euro etc
The notes could even show the same pictures of bridges
Even electronic transactions should be able to generate symbols of peace trust and unity
The point is that if Europe can keep these symbols alive even a eurozone breakup would not have the dire political consequences for Europe that so many predict
The Euro Latest Reprieve
NEW YORK  Like an inmate on death row the euro has received another lastminute stay of execution
It will survive a little longer
The markets are celebrating as they have after each of the four previous uro crisis summits  until they come to understand that the fundamental problems have yet to be addressed
There was good news in this summit Europe leaders have finally understood that the bootstrap operation by which Europe lends money to the banks to save the sovereigns and to the sovereigns to save the banks will not work
Likewise they now recognize that bailout loans that give the new lender seniority over other creditors worsen the position of private investors who will simply demand even higher interest rates
It is deeply troubling that it took Europe leaders so long to see something so obvious and evident more than a decade and half ago in the East Asia crisis
But what is missing from the agreement is even more significant than what is there
A year ago European leaders acknowledged that Greece could not recover without growth and that growth could not be achieved by austerity alone
Yet little was done
What is now proposed is recapitalization of the European Investment Bank part of a growth package of some  billion
But politicians are good at repackaging and by some accounts the new money is a small fraction of that amount and even that will not get into the system immediately
In short the remedies  far too little and too late  are based on a misdiagnosis of the problem and flawed economics
The hope is that markets will reward virtue which is defined as austerity
But markets are more pragmatic if as is almost surely the case austerity weakens economic growth and thus undermines the capacity to service debt interest rates will not fall
In fact investment will decline  a vicious downward spiral on which Greece and Spain have already embarked
Germany seems surprised by this
Like medieval bloodletters the country leaders refuse to see that the medicine does not work and insist on more of it  until the patient finally dies
Eurobonds and a solidarity fund could promote growth and stabilize the interest rates faced by governments in crisis
Lower interest rates for example would free up money so that even countries with tight budget constraints could spend more on growthenhancing investments
Matters are worse in the banking sector
Each country banking system is backed by its own government if the government ability to support the banks erodes so will confidence in the banks
Even wellmanaged banking systems would face problems in an economic downturn of Greek and Spanish magnitude with the collapse of Spain realestate bubble its banks are even more at risk
In their enthusiasm for creating a ingle market European leaders did not recognize that governments provide an implicit subsidy to their banking systems
It is confidence that if trouble arises the government will support the banks that gives confidence in the banks and when some governments are in a much stronger position than others the implicit subsidy is larger for those countries
In the absence of a level playing field why shouldn money flee the weaker countries going to the financial institutions in the stronger
Indeed it is remarkable that there has not been more capital flight
Europe leaders did not recognize this rising danger which could easily be averted by a common guarantee which would simultaneously correct the market distortion arising from the differential implicit subsidy
The euro was flawed from the outset but it was clear that the consequences would become apparent only in a crisis
Politically and economically it came with the best intentions
The singlemarket principle was supposed to promote the efficient allocation of capital and labor
But details matter
Tax competition means that capital may go not to where its social return is highest but to where it can find the best deal
The implicit subsidy to banks means that German banks have an advantage over those of other countries
Workers may leave Ireland or Greece not because their productivity there is lower but because by leaving they can escape the debt burden incurred by their parents
The European Central Bank mandate is to ensure price stability but inflation is far from Europe most important macroeconomic problem today
Germany worries that without strict supervision of banks and budgets it will be left holding the bag for its more profligate neighbors
But that misses the key point Spain Ireland and many other distressed countries ran budget surpluses before the crisis
The downturn caused the deficits not the other way around
If these countries made a mistake it was only that like Germany today they were overly credulous of markets so they like the United States and so many others allowed an asset bubble to grow unchecked
If sound policies are implemented and better institutions established nbspwhich does not mean only more austerity and better supervision of banks budgets and deficits nbspand growth is restored these countries will be able to meet their debt obligations and there will be no need to call upon the guarantees
Moreover Germany is on the hook in either case if the euro or the economies on the periphery collapse the costs to Germany will be high
Europe has great strengths
Its weaknesses today mainly reflect flawed policies and institutional arrangements
These can be changed but only if their fundamental weaknesses are recognized nbspa task that is far more important than structural reforms within the individual countries
While structural problems have weakened competitiveness and GDP growth in particular countries they did not bring about the crisis and addressing them will not resolve it
Europe temporizing approach to the crisis cannot work indefinitely
It is not just confidence in Europe periphery that is waning
The survival of the euro itself is being put in doubt
The Euro PIGHeaded Masters
CAMBRIDGE  Europe is in constitutional crisis
No one seems to have the power to impose a sensible resolution of its peripheral countries debt crisis
Instead of restructuring the manifestly unsustainable debt burdens of Portugal Ireland and Greece the PIGs politicians and policymakers are pushing for everlarger bailout packages with everless realistic austerity conditions
Unfortunately they are not just icking the can down the road but pushing a snowball down a mountain
True for the moment the problem is still economically manageable
Eurozone growth is respectable and the PIGs account for only  of the eurozone GDP
But by stubbornly arguing that that these countries are facing a liquidity crisis rather than a solvency problem euro officials are putting entire system at risk
Major eurozone economies like Spain and Italy have huge debt problems of their own especially given anemic growth and a manifest lack of competitiveness
The last thing they need is for people to be led to believe that an implicit transfer union is already in place and that reform and economic restructuring can wait
European Union officials argue that it would be catastrophic to restructure any member debts proactively
It is certainly the case that contagion will rage after any Greek restructuring
It will stop spreading only when Germany constructs a firm and credible firewall presumably around Spanish and Italian centralgovernment debt
This is exactly the kind of hardheaded solution that one would see in a truly integrated currency area
So why do Europe leaders find this intermediate solution so unimaginable
Perhaps it is because they believe they do not have the governance mechanisms in place to make tough decisions to pick winners and losers
The European Union weak fractured institutions dispose of less than  of eurozone GDP in tax revenues
Any kind of bold decision essentially requires unanimity
It is all for one and one for all regardless of size debt position and accountability
There is no point is drawing up a Plan B if there is no authority or capacity to execute it
Might Europe get lucky
Is there any chance that the snowball of debt dysfunction and doubt will fall apart harmlessly before it gathers more force
Amidst so much uncertainty anything is possible
If eurozone growth wildly outperforms expectations in the next few years banks balance sheets would strengthen and German taxpayers pockets would deepen
The peripheral countries might just experience enough growth to sustain their ambitious austerity commitments
Today strategy however is far more likely to lead to blowup and disorderly restructuring
Why should the Greek people not to mention the Irish and the Portuguese accept years of austerity and slow growth for the sake of propping up the French and German banking systems unless they are given huge bribes to do so
As Stanford professor Jeremy Bulow and I showed in our work on sovereign debt in the  countries rarely can be squeezed into making net payments payments minus new loans to foreigners of more than a few percent for a few years
The current EUInternational Monetary Fund strategy calls for a decade or two of such payments
It has to lest the German taxpayer revolt at being asked to pay for Europe in perpetuity
Perhaps this time is different
Perhaps the allure of belonging to a growing reserve currency will make sustained recession and austerity feasible in ways that have seldom been seen historically I doubt it
True against all odds and historical logic Europe seems poised to maintain the leadership of the IMF
Remarkably in their resignation to the apparently inevitable choice for the top position emergingmarket leaders do not seem to realize that they should still challenge the United States prerogative of appointing the Fund extremely powerful numbertwo official
The IMF has already been extraordinarily generous to the PIGs
Once the new bailoutfriendly team is ensconced we can only expect more generosity regardless of whether these countries adhere to their programs
Unfortunately an ultrasoft IMF is the last thing Europe needs right now
With its constitutional crisis we have reached exactly the moment when the IMF needs to help the eurozone make the tough decisions that it cannot make on its own
The Fund needs to create programs for Portugal Ireland and Greece that restore competitiveness and trim debt and that offer them realistic hope of a return to economic growth
The IMF needs to prevent Europeans from allowing their constitutional paralysis to turn the eurozone debt snowball into a global avalanche
Absent the IMF the one institution that might be able to take action is the fiercely independent European Central Bank
But if the ECB takes over entirely the role of ender of last resort it will ultimately become insolvent itself
This is no way to secure the future of the single currency
The endgame to any crisis is difficult to predict
Perhaps a wholesale collapse of the euro exchange rate will be enough triggering an export boom
Perhaps Europe will just boom anyway
But it is hard to see how the single currency can survive much longer without a decisive move towards a far stronger fiscal union
The Eurous Troubles
CAMBRIDGE The script for the euro has become pure improvisation
Everyone remembers the popping champagne corks and pride that greeted the birth of European Monetary Union
At long last the dollar would be challenged perhaps even dethroned
Europes great political project  the EU  now had an equal economic project
Today however all those dreams seem up for grabs
Daily the euro sinks
No longer is it inconceivable that the US Treasury may step in to bail out Europes new money
What an irony a currency designed to challenge the dollar for supremacy among global currencies now needs US assistance to stop its meltdown
But that is where we may be heading
All this is happening as Europe approaches the introduction of real euro notes in January 
Small wonder that in Germany the coming disappearance of the Dmark in favor of euro notes is causing deep disquiet
No wonder that the French who have rarely had a hard currency to call their own are nervous and want something anything to be done
Such anxieties are exaggerated
It is painful for Europe to lose pride in its new currency so fast but in strict economics terms no harm arises from the euros present weakness
Europes embarrassment is not likely to worsen nor last very long
Five questions are useful at this point
 Who is to blame
 What can be done
 Is the bottom near or can things get worse
 How long will the euros weakness last
 What will bring about change
Looking for something or someone to blame comes naturally to politicians and those who fear having made a big mistake
In these circumstances however that instinct is wrong
The new European Central Bank the main public suspect is not to blame
The ECBs performance so far is unimpressive but it has nonetheless handled the euros decline well
There has been no loss of nerve no departure from the ECBs price stability target and its public presentation is increasingly good
The chief reason for the euros pains is the performance of the US economy
Even when things look more difficult in the US as when inflation began to run higher recently and productivity growth lowered the stock market selloff that followed did not burst the overall market bubble
The euros slide is based upon Europes absolute and relative decline in reference to the American economy
What can be done
Here another common mistake beckons do something anything just do it
But anything Europe could do at this stage would make matters worse
Raising interest rates to the sky wont be credible because it would cause a recession and the ECB could not hold to such a policy for long
Intervention is even less plausible
The world has too many currency choices
So this is the time to let markets take their course
True the US could turn the euro around something no European head of government or finance minister could accomplish
Alan Greenspan might achieve this result simply by muttering that the Euro is too weak but he rightly saves his words for more important issues
The euro has not necessarily reached the bottom
In  the value of European currencies as a basket reached  US cents  below todays levels
It is unlikely but not impossible that the euro could fall that low again
More likely the euro will stabilize at some point in the range of  US cents then begin to climb back up
But it is worth remembering that a weak euro is not all pain it makes European businesses highly competitive
Without such stimulus growth might be significantly less than todays 
What will make the euro recover
The answer almost certainly has to come from America
If and when Americas economy slows and when the valuations of US assets become far more dubious the euro will become an attractive investment
At that point disenchanted holders of euro positions will take a fonder view of their holdings and outsiders from the US and Japan will begin to believe that diversification into the euro is viable
After all the euro can now be bought cheap
If and when that point is reached a bit of ECB intervention can initiate the long march upwards
That time could be months or a year off
Meanwhile the fragile euro is certain to remain on front pages and debates about whom to blame and what to do will remain alive
Benign neglect is the right answer but let no European banker say it loud
The Euro Zone Default Position
WASHINGTON DC  Kazakhstan may be far removed from the euro zone but its recent economic experiences are highly relevant to the euro current travails
As the euro zone struggles with debt crises and austerity in its weaker members Kazakhstan is emerging from a massive bankingsystem collapse with a strong economic recovery
For most of the last decade Kazakhstan gorged on profligate lending courtesy of global banks  just like much of southern Europe
The foreign borrowing of Kazakh banks amounted to around  of GDP with many of these funds used for construction projects
As the money rolled in wages rose realestate prices reached to nearParisian levels and people fooled themselves into thinking that Kazakhstan had become Asia latest tiger 
The party came to a crashing halt in  when two sharpelbowed global investment banks accelerated loan repayments  hoping to get their money back
The Kazakh government which had been scrambling to support its overextended private banks with capital injections and nationalizations gave up and decided to pull the plug
The banks defaulted on their loans and creditors took large aircuts reductions in principal value
But  and here the point  with its debts written off the banking system is now recapitalized and able to support economic growth
Despite a messy default this fresh start has generated a remarkable turnaround
The West European approach to dealing with crazed banks is quite different
Ireland Europe Celtic tiger over the last decade grew in part due to large credit inflows into its anking Real Estate Complex
The Irish banking system external borrowing reached roughly  of GDP  two Kazakhstans
When the world economy dove in  Ireland party was also over
But here where the stories diverge at least so far
Instead of making the creditors of private banks take haircuts the Irish government chose to transfer the entire debt burden onto taxpayers
The government is running budget deficits of  of GDP despite having cut publicsector wages and now plans further cuts to service failed banks debt
Greece is now at a crossroads similar to that of Kazakhstan and Ireland the government borrowed heavily for the last decade and squandered the money on a bloated and unionized public sector rather than modern  and vacant  real estate with government debt approaching  of GDP
The arithmetic is simply horrible
If Greece is to start paying just the interest on its debt  rather than rolling it into new loans  by  the government would need to run a primary budget surplus ie excluding interest payments of nearly  of GDP
This would require roughly another  of GDP in spending cuts and revenue measures ranking it among the largest fiscal adjustments ever attempted 
Worse still these large interest payments will mostly be going to Germany and France thus further removing income from the Greek economy
If Greece is ever to repay some of this debt it will need a drastic austerity program lasting decades
Such a program would cause Greek GDP to fall far more than Ireland sharp decline to date
Moreover Greek public workers should expect massive pay cuts which in Greece poisonous political climate is a sure route to dangerous levels of civil strife and violence
European leaders are wrong if they believe that Greece can achieve a solution through a resumption of normal market lending
Greece simply cannot afford to repay its debt at interest rates that reflect the inherent risk
The only means to refinance Greece debt at an affordable level would be to grant longterm subsidized loans that ultimately would cover a large part of the liabilities coming due in the next  years
And even on such generous terms Greece would probably need a daunting ofGDP fiscal adjustment just to return to a more stable debt path
The alternative for Greece is to manage its default in an orderly manner
Reckless lending to the Greek state was based on European creditors terrible decisionmaking
Default teaches creditors  and their governments  a lesson just as it does the debtors mistakes cost money and your mistakes are your own
With each passing day it becomes more apparent that a restructuring of Greek debt is unavoidable
Some form of default will almost surely be forced upon Greece and this may be the most preferable alternative
A default would be painful  but so would any other solution
And default with an rderly restructuring would instantly set Greece finances on a sustainable path
After tough negotiations the government and its creditors would probably eventually slash Greece debt in half
Greek banks would need to be recapitalized but then they could make new loans again
A default would also appropriately place part of the costs of Greece borrowing spree on creditors
The Germans and French would need to inject new capital into their banks perhaps finally becoming open to tighter regulation to prevent this from happening again and the whole world would become more wary about lending to profligate sovereigns
Ultimately by teaching creditors a necessary lesson a default within the euro zone might actually turn out to be a key step toward creating a healthier European  and global  financial system
The Europe of the Future
PARIS  Whenever people seek a justification for European integration they are always tempted to look backwards
They stress that European integration banished the specter of war from the old continent
And European integration has indeed delivered the longest period of peace and prosperity that Europe has known for many centuries
But this perspective while entirely correct is also incomplete
There are as many reasons to strive towards ver closer union in Europe today as there were back in  and they are entirely forwardlooking
Sixtyfive years ago the distribution of global GDP was such that Europe had only one role model for its single market the United States
Today however Europe is faced with a new global economy reconfigured by globalization and by the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America
It is a world where economies of scale and networks of innovation matter more than ever
By   that is very soon  we can expect eurozone GDP in terms of purchasing power parity to be below that of China
Together the economies of China and India could be around twice the size of the eurozone economy
Over a longer time horizon the entire GDP of the G countries will be dwarfed by the major emerging economies rapid growth
So Europe must cope with a new geopolitical landscape that is being profoundly reshaped by these emerging economies
In this new global constellation European integration  both economic and political  is central to achieving ongoing prosperity and influence
Like individuals in a society eurozone countries are both independent and interdependent
They can affect each other both positively and negatively
Good governance requires that both individual member states and EU institutions fulfill their responsibilities
First and foremost every eurozone country needs to keep its own house in order
This means responsible economic policies on the part of governments as well as rigorous mutual surveillance of those policies  not just fiscal policies but also measures affecting all aspects of the economy  by the Commission and member states
In a society lawenforcement institutions can ultimately compel a citizen to abide by the rules
In the eurozone a framework based on surveillance and sanctions has until the most recent decisions depended on offending states willingness to comply
But what can be done if a member state cannot deliver on its promises
For countries that lose market access the approach of providing aid on the basis of strong conditionality is justified
Countries deserve an opportunity to correct the situation themselves and to restore stability
This approach nonetheless has clearly defined limits
So a second stage is now envisaged for countries that persistently fail to meet their policy targets
During this second stage eurozone authorities would play a much deeper and more authoritative role in the formulation of countries budgetary policies
This moves us away from the current framework which leaves all decisions in the hands of the country concerned
Instead it would be not only possible but in some cases compulsory for the European authorities to take direct decisions
Implementing this idea also implies embracing a new concept of sovereignty given the complex interdependence that exists between eurozone countries
But it is ultimately in the interests of all eurozone citizens that these changes be made
It is my firm conviction that the Europe of the future will embody a new type of institutional framework
What might it look like
Would it be too bold to envisage there being an EU finance ministry one day
Any future European finance ministry would oversee the surveillance of both fiscal policies and competitiveness policies and when necessary impose the econd stage
Moreover it would carry out the usual executive responsibilities regarding supervision and regulation of the EU financial sector
Finally the ministry would represent the eurozone in international financial institutions
Recent events have only strengthened the case for pursuing this approach
Europe leaders are discussing a Treaty change to create stronger economic governance at the EU level and eurozone citizens are themselves calling for better supervision of the financial sector
And I know that our partners in the G look to Europe as a whole rather than to individual member states for solutions
So increasingly it seems that it would be too bold not to consider creating a European finance ministry at some point in the future
But an EU finance ministry would be only one component of Europe future institutional framework
One can imagine that as various elements of sovereignty come to be shared the European Council might evolve into the EU Senate with the European Parliament becoming the lower house
Similarly the European Commission could become the executive while the European Court of Justice takes on the role of an EU judiciary
And given European countries long and proud history I have no doubt that ubsidiarity will play a major role in the future Europe  significantly greater than in current models of federation
Mine are the personal views of a European citizen
The future of Europe is in the hands of its democracies in the hands of Europe people
Our fellow citizens will decide the direction Europe is to take
They are the masters
But however Europe institutions take shape a truly panEuropean public debate is essential
As Europeans we identify deeply with our nations traditions and histories
These are Europe roots
But we also need to extend our branches more widely
So today we should not look back
We must look forward  to opportunities of collective betterment and to every country potential to be stronger and more prosperous in a wellfunctioning union

The European Banking Union
MUNICH  In blatant violation of the Maastricht Treaty the European Commission has come forward with one bailout plan after another for Europe distressed economies
Now it wants to socialize not only government debt by introducing Eurobonds but also banking debt by proclaiming a anking union
Socializing bank debt is both unjust and will result in a future misallocation of resources
Socialization of bank debt across borders implies that a country private borrowing costs are artificially reduced below market rates as insurance in the form of creditdefault swaps is provided free of charge by other countries
Thus capital flows from the core to the periphery would continue to exceed the optimal amount undermining growth for Europe as a whole
History offers countless examples of the misallocation of resources that can result from socialization of bank debt
One is the  savings and loan crisis in the United States which cost US taxpayers more than  billion
Under the umbrella of common deposit insurance US savings banks made a amble for resurrection  borrowing excessively from their depositors and lending the money out to risky enterprises knowing that potential profits could be paid out as dividends to shareholders while potential losses would be socialized
In other words private profits were generated out of socially wasteful activities
And essentially the same happened with US subprime mortgage lending and with the Spanish banking system in the 
In both cases banks took excessive risks in the expectation  eventually vindicated  that governments would bail them out
Spanish banks speculated on a continuing increase in realestate prices which would bring large capital gains to their customers
Indeed they often lent homeowners more than  of the underlying property value
To compensate for the damage that their reckless behavior caused they received  billion  billion in extra credit through Target the European Central Banks interbank payment settlement system and can now expect a further  billion in help from the European Financial Stability Facility
Much of this money will never return
Debtequity swaps would be a much better way to recapitalize the banks
Rather than imposing the costs of the ECB and EFSF losses on European taxpayers the banks creditors could give up some of their claims in exchange for receiving shares from the banks owners
Debtequity swaps rescue the banks without rescuing their shareholders
Ideally bank creditors would not lose money because their fixedinterest claims would be converted into bank shares of similar value
This would be the case as long as the banks losses remained smaller than their equity capital
A true loss would be inflicted on a bank creditors only if the writeoff losses on toxic mortgage loans exceeded the bank equity
But even then it would be better for creditors to bear the loss than for taxpayers to do so because this would encourage more cautious lending in the future
Socializing public debt is already posing a risk to the stillstable eurozone countries
To do the same thing with bank debt could pull hitherto sound economies into the abyss because bank balance sheets are much larger than the volume of government debt
In Spain the public debttoGDP ratio is  but the debt of the Spanish banking system totals  of GDP or about  trillion  about as much as the combined public debt of all five crisisstricken eurozone countries
While the enormous volume of the bank debt implies that governments should shy away from socializing banking risks it also suggests that only the banks creditors could reasonably be asked to foot the bill without being overburdened
Indeed if as some believe only a fraction of the banks equity is at risk the potential debtequity swaps would be minuscule
Spanish banks have  equity capital on average on their balance sheets
Thus a debtequity swap of less than  of the creditors investment would be enough to compensate for the banks losses
And even if the banks private depositors whose claims are  of the aggregate balance sheet were excluded the debtequity swap necessary to compensate for a loss of up to  of the equity would be less than  of the creditors investment volume
Debtequity swaps have been used successfully in many cases and they follow from normal bankruptcy procedures
Apart from avoiding the excess burden and injustice of taxation they also have the benefit of inducing banks owners to choose a prudent investment strategy while persuading creditors to scrutinize and select carefully the banks to which they want to lend
The care taken in augmenting and preserving the wealth that current generations inherited from their ancestors is the ultimate reason for economic growth and capitalism success
Massive government interventions during the crisis have undermined this principle and have probably already destroyed much of the inherited wealth
It is time to heed the fundamental laws of economics and put a stop to the imprudence that those charged with fighting the crisis have been allowed to get away with

The European Consequences of Germany Election
ISTANBUL  Nearly a century ago in  John Maynard Keynes analyzed the economic consequences of the peace following Germany defeat in World War I To be sure the consequences of Germany general election on September  will not be nearly as momentous
But the outcome will not be as inconsequential as most analysts currently claim
For starters even if the current Christian Democratic Union CDUFree Democrat Party FDP coalition forms the next government Chancellor Angela Merkel could make longerterm and more courageous decisions without having to worry about the immediate electoral impact
She would be able to pursue a two or threeyear program instead of her current fourweek strategy
Merkel postelection agenda might still be very cautious emphasizing mediumterm fiscal consolidation for Germany and the eurozone as a whole at the expense of boosting employment and growth
But a reelected Merkel would no doubt be willing to proceed at least by small steps on the creation of a European banking union including a resolution mechanism that draws on eurozonewide resources
Moreover even if Merkel leads the same political coalition she would more strongly support eurozone schemes to encourage lending to small and mediumsize enterprises and European Union education programs such as Erasmus
She would also be willing to work on institutional reforms aimed at closer coordination of EU member states economic policies
Finally even within the CDUFDP camp there is growing recognition that Germany enormous currentaccount surplus  above  of GDP and the world largest in absolute terms at about  billion  means that Germans receive almost no return on about  of their savings
Somewhat faster demand growth in Germany and a lower external surplus would help not only Germany trade partners but also German savers
Of course the CDUFDP coalition may not be returned to power
The other postelection scenarios are a grand coalition between the CDU and the Social Democratic Party SDP a redgreen coalition between the SDP and the Greens if both do better than predicted and the liberal FDP falls below the  electoral threshold possibly with tacit support from the leftwing Die Linke or a CDUGreen coalition
In all three cases the government would be more oriented toward European and eurozone integration than a renewed CDUFDP administration would be
True the German Constitutional Court has ruled out openended financial commitments over which the German parliament has no control so Germany can go only so far in support of greater economic integration without greater political integration
But a government that includes the SDP or the Greens would contain at least one party that is ready for more significant steps toward a quasifederal eurozone featuring elements of fiscal union though limited for the sake of constitutional compliance
Both parties are less complacent than the current government about the eurozone stability and Europe growth prospects
And both believe that there are too many lowpaid marginal jobs in Germany to justify glowing reports about the quality of employment that income growth is too slow and accrues disproportionately to the wealthiest and that somewhat greater eurozone solidarity is in Germany own longterm interest
The German election will not produce a political earthquake and will not suddenly open the door to a federal Europe on the model of the United States with large implicit fiscal transfers and highly centralized defense and foreign policies
But at a minimum the outcome is likely to speed up implementation of eurozone decisions that have already been made leading to somewhat more expansionary economic policies in both Germany and the eurozone
A government that includes the SDP or the Greens  both of which have egalitarianism and internationalism in their DNA  would almost certainly go further and embrace substantial reform renewal and strengthening of eurozone institutions as a mediumterm target
Such a government would back a eurozone strategy led by Germany and France that focuses on growth and employment which would infuse some constructive enthusiasm into the  European Parliament election
A German government coalition that includes the SDP or the Greens now a central player in German politics could thus accelerate the reform and integration that the eurozone needs
That would enable Europe now with the full support of Germany to recover more rapidly from its economic malaise and to take on the global leadership role that has eluded it for so long

The European Economic Model Lives
Back in the early s American officials like me who were making longterm forecasts for the Clinton administration cautioned that it would be rash to forecast an average longrun growth rate of more than  per year  and that actual growth might turn out to be even slower
Now we look back at a decade during which the American economy has grown at an average rate of  per year
Indeed the United States today is  richer than we would have dared forecast a decade ago and that is true despite labormarket slack and thus the largest production shortfalls below potential output in two decades
In America the new economy has proven to be real and there is every reason to think that growth in the next decade will be faster than it was in the past
The acceleration of US economic growth in the late s posed a puzzle for those of us who looked across the Atlantic at Western Europe where was Europes new economy
We could see it in Scandinavia and in scattered pockets elsewhere but the strong imprint of improved computer and communications technologies on the growth rates of output and productivity economywide seemed to be missing
Europe seemed to be falling further and further behind the US
Yet today if we look at transatlantic comparisons Western Europe appears to be doing much better than one would expect if one were to judge from the past decades business press
Western Europes productivity per hour worked for example is now only  or so below Americas
Northwestern University economist Robert Gordon points out several interesting features of Americas GDP that should give cheerleaders of the US model and critics of Europe cause for greater circumspection
For example Americans must buy cars because public transport is so lousy
The value of the cars is calculated in American GDP but European publictransport systems are counted not at their value to passengers but as a cost to government
Similarly Americans keep two million of their fellow citizens in jail the cost of building the prisons and paying the jailers is also included in GDP
Professor Gordon also points out that Americas more extreme climate  colder winters save in Florida and California and hotter summers save in Washington Oregon and California  must spend more on heating and cooling
The net result of all these calculations
Western Europeans work some  less than Americans yet they have a level of social welfare including climate that is only around  lower than Americans and they have more equal income distributions and lower poverty rates as well
From this perspective Western Europe appears to have at least as good a claim to the title of Good Society as does the US
Moreover the economywide productivity gap between the US and Western Europe does not appear to be widening very rapidly if at all
Western European productivity growth almost matches Americas suggesting that the new economy is coming to Western Europe only quietly and with much less fanfare than in America
Of course all favorable judgments of the state of the Western European economy must come with fine print
European unemployment for example appears to be half again as high as in the US
Labor force participation is lower  and a substantial part of that lower labor force participation is not the result of untrammeled choice but of discouraged workers and institutions that make it very difficult for households that have every adult at work
Moreover European labor productivity figures are inflated by the fact that potential workers who would be less productive are much less likely to hold any jobs at all
Looming over everything is the impending demographic crisis of Western Europes socialinsurance state as its population ages
But where is the country or region without serious economic worries and deep structural problems
During the late s the US had an amazingly long run of economic good luck assisted by some very good institutions and some quite good economic policies
By  European senior bureaucrats began to dread the approach of each international meeting as the likely occasion for yet another lecture by the Americans on how Europe needed to become much more like America right now
Thus it is important to note how little  if any  ground America has gained relative to Europe in the past decade according to the yardstick of social welfare
Learning needs to go both ways
The European Museum
In the late nineteenth century Europe viewed Asia mainly as either a source of inspiration for its artists or a focus of imperial ambition
Asians for their part viewed Europe as either a model of modernity as in Meiji Japan or a barometer of decay as in China
A century later the Japanese economic miracle had transformed the image of at least a small part of Asia in European eyes into a place of rapid technological and industrial progress
Now in the first years of the twentyfirst century the perception of Europe in Asia and of Asia in Europe is changing dramatically as Asia economies boom while the European Union finds itself mired in a crisis of identity and confidence
Prominent Asians such as former Singaporean leader Lee Kuan Yew are now warning Europeans that if they continue on their current course Europe will rapidly become irrelevant for anything other than tourism and highend real estate
A prominent Chinese businessman who divides his time between HongKong and London was even more specific
At a private gathering of top business and political leaders in Paris a few weeks ago he said ou Europeans are becoming a Third World country you spend time on the wrong subjects he constitution the welfare state the pensions crisis  and you systematically give the wrong answers to the questions you raise
Europeans views of Asia in general and China in particular are more complex and swing from lucid adjustment to a new and respected competitor to pure ideological rejection
In May  in France the students  or some of them at least  who took to the streets to invent a new world were dreaming of Maoist China a China in the midst of the brutal and senseless Cultural Revolution
Their absurd and baroque infatuation was as much the product of ignorance of Mao crimes as it was the result of boredom in a prosperous society where unemployment was virtually nonexistent
Today by contrast their heirs are openly criticizing the Asian capitalist model
Yesterday China was an anticapitalist lodestar for utopian revolutionaries today it has become an ultraliberal nemesis for a new generation of utopian reactionaries  the defenders of the status quo in Europe
The student demonstrators in the streets of Paris recently don want to become like Chinese and Indians they reject the logic of globalization and refuse to surrender hardwon social guarantees
European economic elites perceive China and India very differently
They are now fully aware that their slightly nostalgic postcolonial view of these countries as large export markets and deep reservoirs of cheap labor has become outdated
China and India have become genuine competitors who deserve respect if not sheer awe
Quality costs and delivery times in auto manufacturing for example are reaching the European level
Europe retains an advantage in terms of pure science as in the pharmaceutical industry but emerging worldclass companies particularly in India are increasingly able to recruit MIT and Harvard graduates while maintaining lower labor costs and thus global competitiveness
Unfortunately although European leaders recognize the Asian challenge they have failed to use it as a reality test in the irresistible process of globalization and as a call to arms in social and economic terms
In fact it would be fair to say that European politicians with few exceptions such as Tony Blair have been slow to adjust their worldviews in accordance with the revolutionary pace of change in Asia
Caught between their lack of longterm strategic vision and their obsession with shortterm interests Europe political leaders have largely failed to win the respect of their Asian counterparts in contrast to European companies which are faring much better in Asian eyes
Of course on a continent that has largely failed to bury its past and close the door to nationalist ghosts the EU is also often regarded by Asians as a model of reconciliation peace and prosperity
But if Europe performance continues to decline would this perception survive
Perhaps Asians would then come to regard the European model as a political version of Venice  a place to visit with nostalgia for its past glory and admiration for its museumlike quality
The European Unionus Battle for Turkey
When the plotters behind the recent suicide attacks in Istanbul launched their human bombs against Jewish synagogues and British office buildings they had several audiences in mind
One audienceand potentially the most importantare the citizens of the European Union which Turkeys political class is eager to join as soon as possible
The battle over Turkish membership in the EU will be fought on many fronts in the country itself where the government is currently undertaking major reforms in order to qualify for candidate status at the negotiating table once the European Council in December  authorizes the Commission to enter into formal accession talks and among the public within the existing member countries
Of the three fronts the latter will be the most demanding
Most EU citizens are uneasy today over the prospect of Turkish membership
Those responsible for the atrocities in Istanbul may have calculated that Islamic terrorism will increase that uneasiness further
Traditionally Europes citizens have always accepted the new members that queued up to join the club as it went from the original group of six countries to the  that will form the EU in 
Once a purely West European community the Union has pushed out its frontiers in all directions
From next year it will stretch from the north of Finland to Cyprus and Malta in the south from Ireland in the west to the Baltic states in the east
While the people inside have often worried that newcomers would take away their jobs and subsidies they usually acquiesced in the end
But Turkey is different
The  new countries that will join next yearand even the Balkan countries that are now being offered the prospect of future membershipare all embraced by a traditional definition of Europe
None of them is of a size that could upset the EUs current balance
Neither applies to Turkey
Except for a small stretch of land its territory lies in Asia not Europe its culture is Islamic not Christian and if it should join in say  its population will be by far the largestand youngestof any EU member
Moreover because Turkey borders on such countries as Iran Iraq and Syria it will bring to the EU a disturbing neighborhood a part of the world incapable of developing a regional order on its own a cockpit of Islamic radicalism and terrorism a collection of fragile states imbued with nationalism a field of competition for arms even nuclear arms a region where the US will remain strategically involved and where Israel will continue to provide a rallying point for antiWestern sentiments
With Turkey as a member the EU will be part of the troubled and troubling wider Middle East the most challenging region in todays world
Yet it is precisely because of these implications that the advantages of having Turkey inside the EU far outweigh the risks
First and foremost the prospect of membership is the most powerful force for modernization in Turkey and a modern democratic and prosperous Turkey is of central interest to Europe whether inside or outside
Moreover including within the EU the moderate type of Islam for which Turkey stands will be a major help in integrating Muslim minorities within European countriesalready large and growing even without the addition of Turkeys population
Finally with the opportunities that Turkeys Islamic traditions regional contacts resources and geography provide the EU will be much better placed to exert a stabilizing influence on a region that will affect Europes security in any case
These are powerful arguments
The big question is whether they are powerful enough to sway a skeptical European public
It would take only one country out of perhaps  EU members in  to bloc Turkeys accession
No doubt some of them will put the matter to a referendum that will leave the decision to the people not just their parliaments
Even in Germany where referenda are not envisaged by the constitution there are calls to hold one over Turkeys entry one opposition party has already announced that it will make this a central issue in next years election campaign for the European Parliament
Once public unease towards Turkey can find focus in a referendum on the countrys potential EU membership the chances for it joining look fairly slim
At the end of the negotiations it may thus come to pass that Turkey is ready for Europe but Europe is not yet ready for Turkey
This is why the battle over Turkish membership has already begun and the bombers of Istanbul seem to have understood this
Those who believe that the EU is right for both Turkey and Europe must also start to fight for what they profess
Nothing would be worsefor both Turkey and Europethan European governments wanting Turkey in but then failing to take their people along
Terrorists will no doubt continue to instill fear of an Islamic Turkey among Europes fainthearted
Let us hope that in the end the attacks on innocent people in the crowded streets of Istanbul do not foster European fears but rather a sense of solidarity with that moderate and dynamic country in the face of a common enemy
The Great Bank Debate
OXFORD  Christine Lagarde the International Monetary Fund managing director recently said of the unfinished agenda for global financialsector reform o start we need concrete progress with the tooimportanttofail conundrum
We need a globallevel discussion of the pros and cons of direct restrictions on business models
Five years on from the start of the crisis with the publication of the Liikanen report on European Union banking reform that debate has finally begun
The Liikanen proposals have much in common with those made in  by the United Kingdom Independent Commission on Banking ICB which I chaired
Both sets of recommendations stress the importance of an interlocking package of measures that combine much greater lossabsorbency with structural reform
And both make the same economic case for such reforms to insulate basic banking services from investment banking risks to make resolution easier and thus more credible to shield taxpayers from risks that belong in the private sector and hence to ensure that banks risktaking is subject to adequate market discipline
Moreover both Liikanen and the ICB favor structured universal banking  legally separate entities with separate capital management and so forth  rather than calling for its demise as urged by those who want to split commercial from investment banking fully
For large banks Liikanen would separate trading from deposit banking while the ICB proposals which are now incorporated in draft legislation in Britain would ringfence retail banking
This by itself is a distinction without a difference
After all a fence to protect the deer from the lions is the same as a fence to keep the lions away from the deer
Unlike their cousin the Volcker Rule neither Liikanen nor the UK approach attempts to draw a line between types of trading
Judging whether trading is proprietary might not quite require indows into men souls which in another context Queen Elizabeth I wisely avoided but America experience shows that it is difficult all the same
Still the Liikanen and UK designs are not identical
Nor should they be
The UK has a much larger banking system relative to its economy size than does Europe as a whole  let alone the United States
The UK system is exposed to different risks which it is in Europe interest to have well managed
Moreover Liikanen is not a onesizefitsall approach as it explicitly proposes powers to require wider separation if needed to ensure resolvability
One clear difference though is that Liikanen unlike the UK proposals allows securities underwriting in deposit banks
This contrasts with the US even after the  repeal of the GlassSteagall Act ban on affiliation between banks and companies engaged principally in underwriting securities
And it sits oddly with separating trading and derivatives from deposit banking since underwriting is akin to selling a large put option and typically riskier than normal marketmaking
With underwriting on the trading side of the fence the deposit bank could still supply the service to customers but as a broker not as a dealer
Underwriting belongs with the lions
Aside from its implementation difficulties there are good reasons not to introduce the Volcker rule rather than the ICBLiikanen proposals in the UK and Europe
First it does not do enough to shield retail banking from investmentbanking risks of which only a small share relate to proprietary trading
Second the US has a very different banking system to begin with including various regulations on how depository institutions can relate to affiliated trading entities
This suggests that a better question is whether to introduce the Volcker rule in addition to rather than instead of ringfencing
In the interest of simplicity I would say no
Enforcing total separation instead of ringfencing would provide a stronger barrier but at a potentially high cost including a risk to financial stability
After all full separation implies that resources from elsewhere in a given banking group are unavailable to address a retailbanking crisis resulting from say a slump in residential and commercial property prices
Such crises can happen
So the ICB concluded that its reform package for the UK would achieve the main aims of full separation at a lower cost and without creating the risk to financial stability that could come from having undiversified correlated standalone domestic retail banking
To be sure the success of this approach depends on the fence staying strong
That requires good initial design and constant regulatory vigilance but so does full separation
Structural reform of banks does not solve all problems
But at least for the UK and the rest of Europe it is a key part of the overall reform package along with much stronger capital and liquidity standards lossabsorbent debt including ailins by creditors real resolvability and so on
There is also the question of how to protect financial stability from risks arising from shadow banking including the risk of contagion to traditional banking which ringfencing helps to contain
Structural reform is also fundamental to the moves toward a European banking union for a union with wellcapitalized and safely structured banks has much better prospects than one without
Otherwise mutualization of contingent liabilities could exacerbate the tooimportanttofail problem
Now that structural reform is explicitly on the agenda the debate about European banking reform is entering a new phase
But as the IMF has stressed the debate needs to go beyond Europe
Moreover it is more than a debate about public policy because in the postcrisis world market incentives might point toward forms of separation between retail and investment banking
But market incentives surrounding various business models will remain distorted so long as taxpayers are liable for bank losses
That provides all the more reason to get them off the hook via structural and other banking reforms
The Erosion of Europe
BERLIN  Just weeks ago the worst of the financial crisis in Europe seemed to be over
Stability seemed to be returning
But appearances proved to be deceptive
A minor problem at least in scale like Cyprus when combined with an almost unbelievable degree of incompetence among the roika the European Commission the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund was enough to turn a molehill into a mountainous crisis
While markets remained calm the Cyprus crisis revealed the full extent of the political disaster that the eurozone crisis has wrought the European Union is disintegrating at its core
Europeans current crisis of confidence concerning Europe is far more dangerous than renewed market anxiety because it cannot be overcome with another liquidity injection by the ECB
Europe old political order was based on competition mistrust power rivalries and ultimately war among sovereign states
It collapsed on May   and was replaced by a system based on mutual trust solidarity the rule of law and compromise
But with the crisis eroding these foundations trust is giving way to mistrust solidarity is succumbing to ancient prejudices and even new hatred between the poor south and the rich north and compromise is being overwhelmed by diktat
And Germany is once again at the center of the process of disintegration
That is because Germany by far the EU strongest economy has enforced a strategy for overcoming the eurozone crisis that worked for Germany at the beginning of the millennium but under completely different internal and external economic conditions
For the distressed southern European states the Germanbacked mixture of austerity and structural reforms is proving fatal because the decisive third and fourth components  debt relief and growth  are missing
It is only a matter of time before one of the large European crisis countries elects a political leadership that no longer accepts the austerity diktats
Even now come election time national governments more or less openly promise to protect their citizens from Europe because Germany has seen to it that austerity and structural reforms take pride of place in managing the crisis
The argument that ough love was necessary in southern Europe because nothing there would ever have changed otherwise has been settled
The love has been very tough indeed generating rapid economic contraction massive unemployment upwards of  among young people and continued fiscal deterioration owing to rising debtservice costs
Indeed all eurozone members are now experiencing weak economic growth if not recession
What does Germany want
A German Europe would never work and the country political class lacks both the courage and the determination to pursue a European Germany
So does Germany want to hold together the monetary union and thus preserve the EU or will it allow dithering and a lack of vision to hasten the erosion of Europe foundations
In this crisis intention takes a back seat to action or lack thereof
The International Herald Tribunerecently quoted Winston Churchill t not enough that we do our best sometimes we have to do what required
That is precisely the order of the day in Europe and the eurozone
What needs to be done has long been clear
The price of the monetary union survival and thus that of the European project is more community a banking union fiscal union and political union
Those who oppose this because they fear common accountability transfers from rich to poor and a loss of national sovereignty will have to accept Europe renationalization  and thus its exit from the world stage
No alternative and certainly not the statusquo  will work
It has become common knowledge in Europe that the ongoing crisis will either destroy the EU or bring about a political union and that without a solidaritybased solution to existing debt and a partial mutualization of new debt the euro cannot be saved
Such steps will make farreaching transfers of sovereignty unavoidable
Is Germany  or France  willing to do that
The real crisis of the EU and the monetary union is not financial but political  or more precisely it is a leadership crisis
A lack of vision courage and strength of purpose is on display in all European capitals but especially so in Berlin and on the part of government and opposition alike
Europe national politicians routinely criticize the EU for its lack of democratic legitimacy yet they bear part of the responsibility for it
Or have proEuropeans become so fainthearted and dejected that they prefer simply to hand over the reins to antiEuropean populists and nationalists
That would be a disaster because the crisis now runs too deep to be resolved by technocratic means
Germany is preparing for a national election in which  much like in last year French presidential election  the European crisis is to play no part or at least only a minor one
Both government and opposition believe that it would be better to tell the people the truth concerning the most vital question of the day only after the election and in measured doses
Such an outcome would make a mockery of democracy
But things may turn out very differently if the dynamics of Europe crisis throw German politicians plans into disarray
An unpleasant surprise cannot be ruled out at this point it might be Europe greatest source of hope
The Europeanization of Russia
In less than four years Russia has undergone an astonishing sea change
Macroeconomic stabilization is but the start
Underlying the economys rapid recovery is the emergence of a common set of fundamental political values
No one questions whether private property should be the basis of economic life
Tight monetary and fiscal policies are now de rigueur until quite recently printing money to finance the budget deficit was widely considered acceptable
All major political forces even of the left support reducing taxes
In short the ideological vestiges of communist economics have been swept away
The achievement of broad political consensus means that institutional change can now become more purposeoriented and consistent
Indeed the consolidation of political parties has given Russias government a stable parliamentary majority for the first time since the postcommunist transition began
But unlike economic stabilization nearuniversal rules do not apply to institutional reform
While there has been noticeable progress on the legal framework of the strategic plan that the government unveiled in  the socalled Gref Program named after Economics Minister German Greff a breakthrough has yet to be achieved
Of more than one hundred reforms planned for  little more than a dozen were fully implemented
Many in Russia now seek to accelerate the pace of reform by pursuing closer ties with the EU
Just as the global strategic realignment that has marked the war against terrorism led to quasimembership for Russia in NATO the attraction is mutual
The EUs Common Strategy on Russia referred in  to the future establishment of an EURF freetrade area 
By  the EU declared an even more ambitious goal a Common European Economic Area based on gradual approximation of EU legislation and standards
Romano Prodis declaration last week that Russia was now a fullyfledged market economy is a step toward this cooperative notion
A common economic area with the EU promises to provide fundamental institutional guidelines for Russias socioeconomic transformation  a blueprint of postcommunist reform that has driven reforms in the former Soviet bloc countries of Central and Eastern Europe
For the first time since communisms collapse Russia can formulate its own longterm development path  one with defined criteria for appraising policy decisions
Adapting European standards to Russian conditions can now be viewed as a set of mediumterm strategic targets  institutional objectives to be achieved within the next  years
These targets are increasingly compatible with Russias social and economic development as well as its strategic rapprochement with the West
The level of educational attainment the evolution of the political system and the structure of GDP make the choice of European standards the most natural and appropriate
But several caveats are in order
First the use of EU institutional criteria must not be confused with the goal of EU accession
The latter is a political issue and Russian society is not yet ready to discuss it
Russia needs standards that are developed in Russia and for Russia not a set of mechanical rules implemented under the control of European entities
The idea is that Russia should determine its own targets and goals rather than formalize its desire to join the EU
Second and related to the first caveat there should be no formal approximation to EU institutions when this would impair Russias competitive advantages
Indeed reforms of the past few years have already put Russia ahead of the EU in several areas including tax legislation fiscal policy which aims at balanced budgets and labor rules
Russias agricultural policy is similarly more efficiencyoriented than that of the EU
Third the legal and technical parameters of the proposed Common European Economic Area remain vague
More work is needed to develop detailed targets for Russia
But a precedent exists the European Economic Area EAA which incorporates EU countries along with Norway Iceland and Liechtenstein
EEA membership implies a common market and substantial progress towards legislative harmonization with the EU but it does not envisage establishment of supranational bodies except for a dispute resolution mechanism
Adaptation of the EUs economic criteria should focus on the following areas
existence of a functioning market economy
effective competition and operation of market forces
structural reforms aimed at establishing secure property rights meaningful bankruptcy legislation an efficient tax system and a stable financial sector
monetary and fiscal policies that promote sustainable growth
establishment of strong administrative and regulatory institutions
None of this of course will happen overnight
Nor is it realistic to believe that Russia will come close anytime soon to meeting the EUs Maastricht criteria for macroeconomic performance
Russias fiscal balance has improved dramatically over the last two years but the rapid economic growth and moderate currency depreciation that Russia needs to catch up with Europe will keep inflation higher than the Maastricht ceiling
Higher inflation invariably means that longterm interest rates will also exceed EU limits
But establishment of a Common European Economic Area to include Russia would make plausible a scenario unthinkable only four years ago
Russia can now aim for a position in Europe that resembles the current partnership between the EU and Norway
This scenario will become even more plausible following Russias admission to the WTO
Russia does not need to join the EU to create institutions worthy of Europe
The eurozone Taking the long view
There is a tendency in looking at the eurozone to focus on the crisis du jour instead of taking the longerterm view
So let step back and take a very long term view of the zone say twelve months
What will be happening over those months and what decisions will the actors have to make
I have spent my career in credit and the most difficult discussion with bond issuers is always the twelvemonth tress scenario Assuming you lose access to the unsecured credit markets today how will you stay alive for the next year
This requires a spreadsheet depicting all expected outflows and all inflows that do not include borrowing money
No one enjoys this exercise
So let look at the peripheral countries cashflow over the next year
Outflows consist of  budget deficits  maturing long and short term debt and  deposit outflows bank runs
Budget deficits are generally getting bigger despite austerity because government revenues are declining
Deposit outflows can be financed by the ECB so long as all of the banks are adequately capitalized
If they aren the EU can provide the funds for recapitalization via the EFSFESM as it is now doing with Spain and Greece
That leaves the main problem maturing debt
None of these countries can borrow at less than 
If they refinance their debts at gt their current debt levels are unsustainable
If they continue to run deficits and also refund their debt at gt they are nonviable
Therefore at some point over the next twelve months the peripherals will be forced to seek to refinance their maturing debt using money from the EU
At present that money is not on offer
The ECB will lend to solvent banks but not to impecunious governments
The EFSFESM will lend to governments but its lending capacity is a fraction of the peripherals outstanding debt
They can take care of Greece Cyprus Portugal and Ireland
But they cannot refinance the debts of Italy and Spain
To rescue Italy and Spain will require eurobonds which have been repeatedly nixed by Germany and the other AAA countries
So the only thing that we know with certainty is that at some point over the next year either one or more of the peripherals will default and leave the eurozone or else Germany amp Co will consent to eurobonds
Both outcomes seem quite implausible but as Lady Thatcher used to say there is no alternative
The Eurozone According to Merkel
BRUSSELS  We had almost given up waiting for them but then they came in a quasiclandestine form
German Chancellor Angela Merkel did not announce her ideas for eurozone reform in a formal speech or in a statement before her peers
Rather she allowed a quickly cobbledtogether and telegraphic FrancoGerman nonpaper to leak ahead of the recent meeting of European heads of state and government
There was no shortage of outcry in other European Union capitals because of the paper undiplomatic bluntness or in Brussels because she did not care about EU procedures and the distribution of competences
But the ideas outlined in the paper deserve serious discussion
The initiative is first of all institutional
Whereas earlier Chancellor Merkel had ruled out the old French idea of eurozonespecific governance for fear of being in a minority among Southern European countries she has now drawn a lesson from the crisis and is proposing that eurozone countries go ahead and tighten cooperation with any others who are able and willing to join them
This is a significant step
On the fiscal side Germany had started by insisting on bolstering sanctions
As is often the case in criminal law the idea was and is more about reassuring public opinion than about preventing wayward behavior
In fact the EU Stability and Growth Pact suffers at least as much from a flawed design as from lack of enforcement it should never be forgotten that as late as  Ireland and Spain looked like paragons of budgetary virtue
Moreover for ten years stewardship from Brussels has failed to bring about reform of national policies and it is not clear that additional or more automatic sanctions would elicit a greater sense of wnership of the rules
The new paper opens a different path it suggests revising and harmonizing national accounting in order to gauge better the vulnerability of eurozone members public finances ensuring that banks creditors rather than governments pay when crisis strikes decentralizing fiscal discipline by requiring each country to adopt a constitutional rule on the stability of the debt ratio and curbing countries contingent liabilities by adjusting pension systems to demographic ageing
As long as each government is given enough autonomy in the implementation of these principles to act in accordance with its own institutional framework and traditions such measures are all on the right track
But things are less clear when it comes to competitiveness
The paper urges all countries to align real wage growth with productivity gains get rid of automatic indexation of wages long gone in France but still alive in Belgium and commit to a minimum rate of investment in research and development education and infrastructure
The praiseworthy intention is to avoid a recurrence of the cost and price divergence within the eurozone during the last ten years
The aim is also  and this is equally commendable  to share the burden of European economic modernization
However all of the indicators emphasized in the FrancoGerman initiative are already being monitored and since  many  not least European Central Bank President JeanClaude Trichet  have loudly regularly and ineffectually warned of divergences within the eurozone
Moreover the discussions that started several months ago about imbalances within the eurozone have floundered on the issue of the symmetry of adjustment
Those countries whose prices have shot up over the last decade point the finger correctly at German competitive disinflation which has led the ECB to keep interest rates low instead of helping them to halt the price spiral
Germany responds that it cannot be blamed for improving productivity which is equally true
The way out of this dialogue of the deaf requires acknowledging that competitiveness is a relative concept and that all national policies including those of surplus countries must be part of the discussion
We have not reached that point yet
The last set of proposals addresses a problem that has not been stressed enough divergences within the eurozone reflect insufficient economic integration for they would not have continued to widen if firms and workers had reacted more swiftly to price differences
The Merkel document puts forward two ideas here mutual recognition of qualifications which would promote labor mobility and  with no concern for the sanctity of tax sovereignty  harmonization of corporatetax bases in order to encourage capital mobility
Neither of these initiatives is a game changer as regards the depth of economic integration within the eurozone but both promise to open a new debate on the structural underpinnings of monetary union
It remains to be seen what EU member states will make of these proposals
The first reactions have been mostly negative because of specific concerns such as wage indexation in Belgium or because the EU institutions want to preserve their legal prerogatives
Noneurozone countries are also concerned that further integration within the core would leave them left out
Leaving bluntness and a disregard for procedures aside eurozone members would be wrong to ignore or dilute these ideas
The eurozone needs a Germany that is engaged not absent and the paper delivers a message that needs to be heard financial solidarity goes hand in hand with economic and budgetary responsibility
The scene is now set for this fundamental conversation
The False Promise of a Eurozone Budget
BRUSSELS  A key question confronts the four presidents of Europe major institutions the European Commission the European Council the European Central Bank and the Eurogroup as they prepare their report on how to reform the common currency Does the eurozone need its own budget
They are facing the argument that the United States monetary union works much better because there is a large federal budget to smooth the impact of asymmetric shocks  that is shocks to individual states
The eurozone it is claimed should have its own budget to provide similarly automatic insurance to its members
This argument however misreads the US experience
True in the US as in most existing federal states the federal budget redistributes income across regions thus offsetting at least part of the interregional differences in income
But while this has been repeatedly documented in many cases the inference that redistribution is equivalent to a shock absorber is wrong
For example in the US the federal budget offsets a substantial part estimated at  of the differences in per capita income levels across states because poorer states contribute less income tax on average and receive higher transfer payments
But this does not imply that these mechanisms also provide insurance against shocks sudden changes in income for individual states
Many of the transfers from the federal government  especially basic social support like food stamps  vary little with the local business cycle
On the revenue side the degree to which federal taxation absorbs shocks at the state level cannot be very large for the simple reason that the main source of federal revenues that does react to the business cycle the federal income tax accounts for less than  of GDP
The low sensitivity of both federal expenditure and federal revenues to local businesscycle conditions explains why only a small fraction estimated at about   of any shock to the GDP of any individual state is absorbed via automatic transfers to and from the US federal budget
One idea that has been mooted repeatedly in Europe is to create some European or at least eurozone unemployment insurance fund
This idea is attractive at first sight
But here too the reference to the US experience is misleading
In the US unemployment insurance is organized at the state level
The federal government intervenes only in the case of major nationwide recessions and provides some supplementary benefits for the longterm unemployed
But this support is given to all states and thus does not provide those most affected with much more support than the others receive
Moreover unemployment benefits are not as important as is often assumed
In most countries they amount to only about  of GDP even during a major recession
In the US the annual supplementary federal expenditure has amounted to only about  of GDP in recent years
It is thus clear that a eurozone unemployment insurance system would never be able to offset major shocks such as those hitting Ireland or Greece where GDP has shrunk by more than 
The case of Spain illustrates another feature of European economies that makes it difficult to argue for a federal unemployment scheme
Spanish unemployment is now close to  which a priori should be a good justification for some form of shock absorber
But Spanish unemployment has typically been consistently higher than the eurozone average and fell to singledigit levels only as a result of an unsustainable building boom
Any common eurozone unemployment scheme would thus risk financing the longterm unemployment created by rigid national labormarket institutions which for decades have proved impervious to reforms
All in all it is difficult to base the argument for some eurozone shock absorber on the US experience
But how can one explain the fact that the global financial crisis led to no regional banking crises in the US whereas several eurozone countries banking systems are under such stress that their governments have had to rescue them and then be rescued in turn by the eurozone bailout fund
This reflects another aspect of US arrangements that again is not widely appreciated
The US anking union provides tangible insurance against local financial shocks
For example the local realestate boom and bust in Nevada was as severe as that in Spain or Ireland
But in Nevada which is similar in size to Ireland the local banking system losses were absorbed to a large extent by US anking union institutions particularly the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC and the federal mortgagerefinancing agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
For Nevada such support can be estimated at  of its ational income
Ireland would certainly be in much better shape if it had received a similar transfer
This leads to a simple conclusion The euro longterm stability depends far more on completing plans for a European banking union than it does on creating some new budget for the eurozone
The Eurozone Autumn Hangover
NEW YORK  After a summer of Europeans forgetting their woes and tanning themselves at the beach the time for a reality check has come
For the fundamental problems of the eurozone remain unresolved
First a trilliondollar bailout package in May prevented an immediate default by Greece and a breakup of the eurozone
But now sovereign spreads in the peripheral eurozone countries have returned to the levels seen at the peak of the crisis in May
Second a fudged set of financial tress tests sought to persuade markets that European banks needed only  billion in fresh capital
But now AngloIrish alone may have a capital hole as high as  billion raising serious concerns about the true health of other Irish Spanish Greek and German banks
Finally a temporary acceleration of growth in the eurozone in the second quarter boosted financial markets and the euro but it is now clear that the improvement was transitory
All of the eurozone peripheral countries GDP is still either contracting Spain Ireland and Greece or barely growing Italy and Portugal
Even Germany temporary success is riddled with caveats
During the  financial crisis GDP fell much more in Germany  because of its dependence on collapsing global trade  than in the United States
A transitory rebound from such a hard fall is not surprising and German output remains below precrisis levels
Moreover all the factors that will lead to a slowdown of growth in most advanced economies in the second half of  and  are at work in Germany and the rest of the eurozone
Fiscal stimulus is turning into fiscal austerity and a drag on growth
The inventory adjustment that drove most of the GDP growth for a few quarters is complete and tax policies that stole demand from the future ash for clunkers all over Europe etc have expired
The slowdown of global growth  and actual doubledip recession risks in the US and Japan  will invariably impede export growth even in Germany
Indeed the latest data from Germany  declining exports falling factory orders anemic industrialproduction growth and a slide in investors confidence  suggest that the slowdown has started
In the periphery the trilliondollar bailout package and the nonstressful tress tests kicked the can down the road but the fundamental problems remain large budget deficits and stocks of public debt that will be hard to reduce sufficiently given weak governments and public backlash against fiscal austerity and structural reforms large currentaccount deficits and privatesector foreign liabilities that will be hard to rollover and service loss of competitiveness driven by a decadelong loss of market share in laborintensive exports to emerging markets rising unit labor costs and the strength of the euro until  low potential and actual growth and massive risks to banks and financial institutions with the exception of Italy
This is why Greece is insolvent and a coercive restructuring of its public debt is inevitable
It is why Spain and Ireland are in serious trouble and why even Italy  which is on relatively sounder fiscal footing but has had flat per capita income for a decade and little structural reform  cannot be complacent
As fiscal austerity means more recessionary and deflationary pressures in the short run one would need more monetary stimulus to compensate and more domestic demand growth  via delayed fiscal austerity  in Germany
But the two biggest policy players in the eurozone  the European Central Bank and the German government  want no part of that agenda hoping that a quarter of good GDP data makes a trend
The rest of the eurozone is in barely better shape than the periphery the bond vigilantes may not have woken up in France but economic performance there has been anemic at best  driven mostly by a mini housing boom
Unemployment is above  the budget deficit is  of GDP larger than Italy and public debt is rising sharply
Nicolas Sarkozy came to power with lots of talk of structural reforms he is now weakened even within his own party and lost regional elections to the left the only case in Europe of a shift to the left in recent elections
Given that he will face a serious challenge from the Socialist Party candidate  most likely the formidable Dominique StraussKahn  in the  presidential election Sarkozy is likely to postpone serious fiscal austerity and launch only cosmetic structural reforms
Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme as current holder of the rotating EU presidency now speaks of greater European policy unity and coordination
But Leterme seems unable to keep his own country together let alone unite Europe
Even Angela Merkel  in growing Germany  has been weakened within her own coalition
Other eurozone leaders face stiff political opposition Silvio Berlusconi in Italy whom one hopes may soon be booted out of power Jos Luis Rodrguez Zapatero in Spain George Papandreou in Greece
And politics is becoming nationalistic and nativist in many parts of Europe reflected in an antiimmigrant backlash raids against the Roma Islamophobia and the rise of extreme rightwing parties
So a eurozone that needs fiscal austerity structural reforms and appropriate macroeconomic and financial policies is weakened politically at both the EU and national levels
That is why my bestcase scenario is that the eurozone somehow muddles through in the next few years at worst and with a probability of more than onethird the eurozone will break up owing to a combination of sovereign debt restructurings and exits by some weaker economies
The Eurozone Coming Inflation Divide
ZURICH  Discussions within the European Central Bank Governing Council which is poised to meet on April th are about to get hot
The risk that rising inflation in emerging Asia could spill over into Europe will pit the Bank inflation hawks against those in favor of ensuring as fast a return to full employment as possible
But what may cause even greater dissension is a renewed clash of national interests as inflation rates within the eurozone diverge
The underlying cause of this divergence is the much larger role that imports from China and other East Asian emerging economies play in the German or Belgian economies than in southern European countries
For example Germany imports from China totaled roughly  billion in  nearly equivalent to the imports from France Greece Italy Portugal and Spain combined And China trade significance as a share of GDP is nearly twice as great for Germany as it is for any of these countries
In addition to this difference in the relative magnitude of imports the benign price effect of lowcost import competition is much larger in Germany competitive retail landscape than in the more traditional and uncompetitive retail systems of Italy or Greece
Overall these structural economic disparities have led to vast differences in the ways that various eurozone members have benefited from the rise of cheap Asian imports over the last  years
Now that the era of cheap imports is waning however the effect on prices will be reversed and those who benefited the most in the past may now suffer the most from Asian inflation
The spillover of inflation from China to Europe may explain the recent upward pressure on prices in Germany
The figure relates the inflation rate during the second half of  to the relative importance of imports from China
Among the depicted countries a larger Chinese import share was clearly associated with a much higher inflation rate
It is likely that in the months to come inflation in emerging Asia will cause pronounced divergence in inflation rates in the eurozone
Such divergence of course implies ample potential for discord within the ECB in the near future
But it will also accelerate a solution to the eurozone main structural problem its internal competitive imbalances owing to wagegrowth trends since the introduction of the euro that underpinned to Germany large trade surplus visavis the rest of the eurozone
So now  for once  it is the German economy that is bound for higher inflation than the rest of Europe
And make no mistake about whether rising prices will feed through to wage growth
Already barely a year into the recovery from the worst economic crisis since World War II unemployment in Germany is at a postunification low
With the economy likely to grow substantially as Chinese firms competitiveness deteriorates due to rising wages it is hard to imagine that German trade unions will not demand hefty realwage increases as well
But any pickup of wage growth in Germany will bring about an unintended benefit a muchneeded convergence of unit labor costs in the eurozone
Although this might be hard to swallow for traditionalists among central bankers it now seems likely that high inflation in Germany will be the price of achieving the eurozone longterm cohesion

The Eurozone Fork in the Road
BUENOS AIRES  Many observers have recently declared that the eurozone debt crisis is practically resolved or at least on hold for a few years
The falling yields at the Italian government last bond auctions in  suggested a significant reduction in the perceived sovereigndefault risk
Since Italian bonds are regarded as the bellwether of the crisis many interpret this is a sign that the European debt market is normalizing
The olution to the crisis was putatively facilitated by the European Central Bank decision to lend unlimited funds to commercial banks for threeyear terms at very low rates
But a central bank would normally do even more to fulfill its role as lender of last resort
So why all the renewed optimism
The immediate answer is that national banks will now use the scheme to borrow cheaply from the ECB and invest in shortterm sovereign bonds using the interestrate spread to create a profitable overeign carry trade
Despite the inefficiencies and distortions arising from such monetary financing the ECB may indeed provide some breathing space for governments
But the real reason why this otherwise standard policy decision seems like such an important step is that for the first time the ECB has recognized the need to address a fundamental flaw in the eurozone architecture the ECB itself
At the core of the problem is currency
In the  emergingmarket crises were first and foremost currency crises sharp corrections of overvalued currencies that bankrupted public and private sector debtors
By contrast the currency issue in the European crisis is difficult to pinpoint
Is Italian euro debt denominated in local or foreign currency
Whose currency is the euro
And whose central bank is the ECB
These questions are key to the European predicament
Indeed the possible answers suggest two very different versions of the eurozone
One version of the eurozone conceives it as a unity externally and fiscally balanced and with a fully functioning monetary union
It is also heavily indebted but in domestic currency
The alternative conception assumes that the eurozone is a group of individual countries within a common currency area
Most of the countries are unbalanced and are indebted in a currency the euro that they cannot print on demand
This is equivalent to foreigncurrency debt
In the first version the euro crisis minus the currency problem the scenario looks more like the United States than like Latin America in the  with Italy resembling California rather than Argentina
In the second version however the eurozone saga is comparable to the emerging markets story
Like a dysfunctional family the northern dvanced countries ponder whether or not to bail out the southern merging economies
The prognoses for each case are starkly different
In the former version interest rates converge and the default risk is nil because with the ECB backstopping its members liabilities as the Federal Reserve does in the US the euro becomes ocal currency
And how often do we hear about sovereign restructurings of localcurrency debt
In the latter version of the eurozone there is differential credit risk and ultimately bank runs deeuroization and default the common currency is at odds with the needs of the member states
Which of these two alternatives should prevail is a question for eurozone members to decide
But two things are clear
First the eurozone future will be determined largely by the ECB role
Second there is little flexibility  European policymakers cannot overcome the crisis if they do not eliminate the currency problem and the resulting default risk
This helps to explain the misgivings about the International Monetary Fund massive aid to the region
Why would the IMF lend Europe special drawing rights the Fund unit of account rather than euros thereby creating a currency imbalance
Such an imbalance is at the root of all emergingmarket crises the IMF actions therefore suggest that Europe is already giving up on the euro
Today the euro faces a fork in the road
One route a currency area without sovereign backstopping will lead to debt currency crises and the eurozone dissolution
The other a monetary union with a proper central bank internal fiscal transfers and active regionallyoriented monetary policy will lead to a slow but steady recovery without default
Clearly to paraphrase Robert Frost the road taken will make all the difference
For that reason the euro fate lies not in Athens or in Rome but at the ECB headquarters in Frankfurt
The Eurozone Last Stand
NEW YORK  The eurozone crisis is reaching its climax
Greece is insolvent
Portugal and Ireland have recently seen their bonds downgraded to junk status
Spain could still lose market access as political uncertainty adds to its fiscal and financial woes
Financial pressure on Italy is now mounting
By  Greek public debt will be above  of GDP and rising
Alternatives to a debt restructuring are fast disappearing
A fullblown official bailout of Greece public sector by the International Monetary Fund the European Central Bank and the European Financial Stability Facility would be the mother of all moralhazard plays extremely expensive and politically nearimpossible owing to resistance from core eurozone voters  starting with the Germans
Meanwhile the current French proposal of a voluntary rollover by banks is flopping as it would impose prohibitively high interest rates on the Greeks
Likewise debt buybacks would be a massive waste of official resources as the residual value of the debt increases as it is bought benefiting creditors far more than the sovereign debtor
So the only realistic and sensible solution is an orderly and marketoriented  but coercive  restructuring of the entire Greek public debt
But how can debt relief be achieved for the sovereign without imposing massive losses on Greek banks and foreign banks holding Greek bonds
The answer is to emulate the response to sovereigndebt crises in Uruguay Pakistan Ukraine and many other emergingmarket economies where orderly exchange of old debt for new debt had three features an identical face value socalled ar bonds a long maturity  years and interest set well below the currently unsustainable market rates  and close to or below the original coupon
Even if the face value of the Greek debt were not reduced a maturity extension would still provide massive debt relief  on a presentvalue basis  to Greece as a euro of debt owed  years from now is worth much less today than the same euro owed a year from now
Moreover a maturity extension resolves rollover risk for the coming decades
The advantage of a par bond is that Greece creditors  banks insurance companies and pension funds  would be able and allowed to continue valuing their Greek bonds at  cents on the euro thereby avoiding massive losses on their balance sheets
That in turn would sharply contain the risk of financial contagion
Rating agencies would consider this debt exchange a redit event but only for a very short period  a matter of a few weeks
Consider Uruguay whose rating was downgraded to elective default for two weeks while the exchange was occurring and then was upgraded though not to investment grade when thanks to the exchange success its public debt became more sustainable
The ECB and creditor banks can live for two or three weeks with a temporary downgrade of Greece debt
Moreover there would be few holdouts that refuse to participate in the exchange
Previous experience suggests that most holdtomaturity investors would accept a par bond while most marktomarket investors would accept a discount bond with a higher coupon that is a bond with a lower face value  an alternative that could be offered and has been in the past to such investors
At the same time the best way to contain financial contagion would be to implement a panEuropean plan to recapitalize eurozone banks
This implies using official resources like the EFSF not to backstop an insolvent Greece but to recapitalize the country banks  and those in Ireland Spain Portugal Italy and even Germany and Belgium that need more capital
In the meantime the ECB must continue to provide unlimited resources to banks under liquidity stress
To reduce the risk of financial pressures on Italy and Spain both countries need to press ahead with fiscal austerity and structural reforms
Moreover their debt could be ringfenced with a larger package of EFSF resources andor with the issuance of Eurobonds  a further step towards European fiscal integration
Finally the eurozone needs policies to restart economic growth on its periphery
Without growth any austerity and reform will deliver only social unrest and the constant threat of a political backlash without restoring debt sustainability
To revive growth the ECB needs to stop raising interest rates and reverse course
The eurozone should also pursue a policy  partially via looser monetary policy  that weakens the value of the euro significantly and restores the periphery competitiveness
And Germany should delay its austerity plan as the last thing that the eurozone needs is a massive fiscal drag
The eurozone current muddlethrough approach is an unstable disequilibrium kicking the can down the road and throwing good money after bad will not work
Either the eurozone moves toward a different equilibrium  greater economic fiscal and political integration with policies that restore growth and competitiveness including orderly debt restructurings and a weaker euro  or it will end up with disorderly defaults banking crises and eventually a breakup of the monetary union
The status quo is no longer sustainable
Only a comprehensive strategy can rescue the eurozone now
More Leadership for More Europe
MILAN  The debate about improving economic governance within the eurozone is shedding new light on the system weaknesses
It was already evident when the Maastricht
Treaty was signed in  that a monetary union without something similar in the fiscal domain would be unsustainable in the long run
Then for the common currency first decade that fundamental flaw was papered over
Now the eurozone  with a centralized monetary policy run by the European Central Bank alongside  national fiscal policies  has come to look like a mockery of economic common sense
Early on important states like France and Germany stopped taking seriously the European Union Stability and Growth Pact SGP which was supposed to guarantee fiscal discipline and coordination among the member states
With the euro introduction boosting intraEuropean trade and lowering inflation in many member states fiscal obligations were simply ignored
The euro quickly became the world second most important currency and it proved to be a shield against external financial turbulence
Optimism soared and prudence fled  reflected in premature eurozone membership for countries like Greece as well as in the gap between the pace of EU enlargement and that of institutional integration
In other words Europe decisionmakers ultimately overlooked the basic requirements of a monetary union in a heterogeneous economic area
nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp A sizeable common budget for the provision of public goods
nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp Fiscal transfers from more prosperous areas to lagging or distressed regions
nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp Some form of mutualization of public debt carried out under stringent rules
nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp Above all a central bank with all of the prerogatives and instruments needed to serve as lender of last resort
Satisfying these conditions would of course lead to fullyfledged political union but the process could be gradual starting with a banking union a fiscal union or a central bank with lenderoflastresort status  a functionalist approach that might be more politically viable
Some will oppose greater solidarity nonetheless disregarding the elementary fact that enhanced interdependence in a monetary union requires it and ignoring the Lisbon Treaty affirmation of Europe ocial market model
A monetary union that does not benefit all of its participants will not survive for long
After the eurozone sovereigndebt crisis erupted defaults were avoided by establishing the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism since replaced by the European Stability Mechanism and by crafting a more pragmatic and reinforced role for the ECB acting with the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund
And a new iscal compact foresees enshrining member states commitment to budget balance  and to reducing public debt to within  of GDP in  years  in their constitutions
But any assessment of European economic governance must acknowledge the slow contradictory nature of intergovernmental decisionmaking in which a misconceived notion of national interest together with upsurges in popular antiEU sentiment and electoral pressure has led to a stopandgo process punctuated by financialmarket swoons
Viewed in these terms the European political class has clearly failed to exercise leadership
The challenge now is twofold how to cope with the financial crisis while creating a safer economic future through better governance
Excessive emphasis on fiscal rigor unaccompanied by measures to stimulate growth has reinforced recessionary trends placing additional strain on national budgets and debtGDP ratios
That drives up affected governments borrowing costs further fueling a downward spiral
Any lasting solution requires Europeans to acknowledge that they now face a common problem that can be resolved only by greater cohesion and financial solidarity
The ECB must become a genuine central bank for Europe
The European banking system must be turned into a banking union with the ECB responsible for prudential supervision
The fiscal compact must be implemented quickly and progress on harmonizing fiscal policies should continue
But fiscal discipline must be accompanied by policies that promote growth without which balanced budgets and debt reduction cannot be achieved
The Europe  strategy approved two years ago in part to improve economic governance is a good starting point offering the basis for the rowth compact that some EU governments have sought
The path to improved European economic governance leads through the EU political institutions with ore Europe presupposing further strengthening of the European Parliament and the European Commission and the abolition of veto powers in the European Council
The argument that strengthening Europe common institutions would reduce national sovereignty appears very weak for the simple reason that in today globalized economy sovereignty is more apparent than real
Parallel with these changes European leaders must publicly acknowledge that if the euro collapses Europe will quickly revert to competitive devaluations intraEU protection and eggarthyneighbor policies all of which were evident in the  and 
European public opinion must be made aware that increasing interdependence means that the exchangerate stability and gradual completion of the single market implied by the euro really do benefit all participants
Europe political class needs to find the courage to take the next steps toward a closer union
The small price that nationstates will have to pay is negligible compared to the likely consequences of inaction
The Euro House Divided
BRUSSELS  The European Commission latest economic outlook paints a disheartening picture unemployment rates close to or above  in Austria Germany and the Netherlands in  but above  in Greece and Spain and roughly  in Ireland and Portugal
In the same year per capita GDP is expected to be almost  above its precrisis level in Germany but about  below in Ireland Portugal and Spain  and a terrifying  below in Greece
So the deep economic and social divide that has emerged within the eurozone is expected to persist
Such a gulf within a monetary union cannot be sustained for very long
As Abraham Lincoln said  house divided against itself cannot stand
The same monetary policy cannot possibly fit the needs of a country that is in depression and another that is at or close to full employment
Indeed the single most important question for the future of the eurozone is whether the gap between prospering and struggling members is being closed
The optimistic reading is that despite no sign of improvement in the labor market economic performance has in fact started to improve and an adjustment process is under way
The proof it is often argued is that external deficits have contracted substantially
External accounts clearly matter because they reflect the balance between domestic saving and investment
Until  imbalances within the eurozone largely resulted from too little saving andor too much realestate investment resulting in a growing accumulation of private debt
So the contraction of external deficits is a sign that a correction is under way and the rebalancing is impressive
In Spain Portugal and Greece the deficit has been reduced by more than seven percentage points of GDP since  and in Ireland the currentaccount balance has swung into surplus
The problem however is that a large part of this improvement reflects collapsing domestic demand which has plummeted by around onequarter in Greece and Ireland since  and by oneeighth in Spain and Portugal
Investment in equipment  the key to strengthening productive capital in the tradablegoods sector  has generally suffered even more
To be sure demand contraction was inevitable in these countries given that they were living far beyond their means no economy can permanently sustain a rate of demand growth exceeding that of GDP
But what we have seen since  is an overshooting of the contraction in consumer demand and domestic investment
This cannot be regarded as a success
The news is better on the export side
Despite a grim environment exportsGDP ratios have increased significantly in all four economies
Ireland was known to be a very reactive outwardoriented economy
But it not only Ireland
Confronted with domestic economic collapse and a stagnant European environment firms in Greece Spain and Portugal have turned to overseas markets and significantly increased their countries shares of eurozone exports to the rest of the world
Spain performance in foreign markets is especially impressive
On the eve of the euro creation its exports outside the EU were just a quarter of French nonEU exports now they are half the French level
The question to which a clear answer may be impossible is how much of these exports are for profit and how much are for survival  and thus whether strong trade performance can be sustained
This brings us to the issue of price and cost adjustment
During the euro first decade the countries that are now struggling recorded persistently higher wage and price inflation than those in Europe north
To recover and return to both internal and external balance they must not only close the cost gap but actually reverse it thereby generating the trade surpluses needed to repay the foreign debt that they accumulated in the meantime
The news on this front is mixed
Since  labor costs have roughly stagnated in Greece Spain and Portugal though the mix of wage cuts and productivity gains varies from country to country and have contracted by  in Ireland whereas they have increased by more than  in Germany
So a rebalancing is under way
Contrary to stereotypes for example real wages in Greece have declined by  annually over the last three years
The problem however is that prices have generally proved much more rigid declining only in Ireland
In the rest of struggling Europe price adjustment is barely noticeable
Firms especially in sectors sheltered from international competition have retained market power and have increased prices in response to the rising cost of capital
The result is that the process of internal devaluation as economists call it is occurring very slowly
Employees have suffered wage cuts but prices have not declined accordingly so their loss of purchasing power is higher than it should be
Likewise economies have not recovered lost competitiveness so employment especially in the tradedgoods sector is lower than it should be
Austerity and reforms were supposed to deliver rebalancing within the eurozone
And so they have at least insofar as external balances are concerned
But despite visible progress on the export front and noticeable laborcost reductions this rebalancing is mostly the result of the same collapse in domestic demand that is driving mass unemployment
Ultimately perhaps all the pain will pay off
But societies may lose patience in the meantime
This should be enough to prompt a reassessment
The issue is not whether fiscal consolidation and external rebalancing are necessary  they are
It is how to make them politically and socially sustainable
The Eurozone Strategy of Pain
BRUSSELS  For the third year in a row the eurozone is the weakest link in the world economy
In  attention was focused on responses to the crisis on the eurozone periphery  Greece Portugal and Ireland
In  the crisis moved to the core with Italy and Spain feeling the heat and concerns mounting about the viability of the eurozone itself
The question for  is whether those tensions will abate or reach a new climax
Once again the Greek crisis is the focus of attention and epitomizes Europe failings
Once again hard decisions have to be made about debt restructuring and the provision of further assistance to Athens
And once again the Europeans have to accept that the situation is more serious than they thought
But the depth of Greece woes should not obscure the fact that it is a small economy and in many respects an extreme special case
No other country flouted the European Union budget rules the way Greece did or has accumulated as large a publicdebt burden and no other EU country combines to the same extent a dysfunctional state and an uncompetitive private economy
The real battle is being fought in Italy and Spain
Both countries borrowing conditions deteriorated in the second half of 
Both are so large  accounting for  and  of eurozone GDP respectively  that financing them through multilateral assistance would strain if not exhaust the resources of the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund
Both recently installed new reformminded governments
And both are struggling to rebuild competitiveness foster growth restore fiscal soundness and clean up banks balance sheets
If they succeed the euro will survive if they fail it won at least in its present form
That is why discussions over the last few months have largely if implicitly been about how to support adjustment and reform in Italy and Spain
Proposals to permit the European Central Bank to intervene more decisively in bond markets or to increase the size of the irewall by leveraging the European Financial Stability Facility EFSF were intended to set an upper limit on interest rates paid by Italy and Spain on their debt emissions
Similarly proposals to create common bonds were intended to quell expectations of insolvency by ensuring that these countries would eventually be able to borrow against their eurozone partners guarantee
All of the discussions were couched in general terms but everybody had the same specific countries in mind
None of these proposals it seems will be implemented anytime soon
The ECB has bought some Italian and Spanish bonds and it might buy more but it has made clear that it is not ready to commit to a ceiling for longterm interest rates
The EFSF size will be increased by accelerating the creation of the permanent European Stability Mechanism and by letting it overlap with the EFSF
But the EFSF capacity will remain at roughly  billion  well below the  trillionplus envisaged by those who advocate bringing massive financial firepower to bear the socalled azooka solution
Likewise Eurobonds are officially off the agenda at least for now
Rather Europe is putting in place a new fiscal compact to ensure that all eurozone countries adopt and implement stringent budgetary rules
These choices partly reflect pragmatic concerns all of the financialengineering schemes that have been proposed to protect Italy and Spain from aggravated borrowing conditions raise legal political or governance difficulties
But there is a principle at issue as well it is thought particularly in Germany that protection from market pressure would only impede adjustment and reform
Indeed the perception in Northern Europe is that only serious strains provide the required incentives to overcome domestic political and social obstacles to slashing public spending and reforming labor markets
For Southern Europe no pain means no gain a deep recession and a sharp increase in unemployment may be the price of lasting improvements in productivity and competitiveness
This reasoning is not without justification
Soon after the ECB began buying Italian bonds last August thenPrime minister Silvio Berlusconi government backtracked on its commitments to tax reform
Even though it later reversed its stance the episode was widely regarded as clear evidence of the moralhazard effect of ECB support
Only after the bond market turned on Berlusconi again was he replaced by the reformminded Mario Monti
But the strategy is a highrisk gamble
Governments may need incentives to act but they also need to be able to show their citizens that reform pays
If after a few quarters of fiscal adjustment and painful reform output is lower unemployment higher and the outlook darker governments may soon lose public support and reform may stall as we have seen in Greece
Reformminded teams may lose power to populists
Furthermore a degraded macroeconomic and financial environment increases the likelihood of bank failures with immediate consequences for public finances and economic confidence
These risks are compounded by the need for reform in several countries at once
Indeed there is a allacy of composition in the current approach the countries in need of serious adjustment and improved competitiveness include the whole of Southern Europe and France and jointly account for more than onehalf of eurozone GDP
True competition for investment is an incentive to act
But macroeconomic and financial interdependence may render success elusive if reforming countries face an adverse regional environment of stagnating or falling demand
It is one thing to believe that governments act only under pressure and that societies accept reforms only if they believe that there is no other alternative it is quite another to believe that adjustment and reform will proceed if all of Southern Europe is struggling with recession
Keeping Southern Europe on a short leash would be a more credible strategy if accompanied by a growth program for the entire eurozone
And at this stage such a program is nowhere in sight
The Eurozone Strength in Disunity
FLORENCE  For months an increasingly frenetic even apocalyptic debate about the fate of the euro has been the major driver of global instability
Can Europe common currency survive No less a figure than former United States Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has now declared that it cannot
But the euro also seems surprisingly resilient in the face of this woe
Unlike in the early summer of  it has been largely stable relative to the dollar on foreignexchange markets
That stability is puzzling
Skeptics have plenty of ammunition for their critique of the euro
European governments highlevel crisis diplomacy and new and ever more complex mechanisms sometimes briefly calm the markets but the tide of doubt quickly sweeps back in
For a day or sometimes only for a few hours traders succumb to the illusion of stability fueling a euphoric but ephemeral financialmarket rally
Then they awaken to the reality that not much has really changed and that in a few weeks or months the problems will reappear in a seemingly even more intractable form
All manner of new legal and constitutional difficulties constantly arise
Is an amendment to the EU treaty required
Isn that politically unthinkable
One is ineluctably led to the conclusion that governance of the eurozone is irredeemably flawed
But the persistence of these difficulties sheds light on why the eurozone was established in the first place
Market turbulence demonstrates a need for some institutional mechanism that can ensure greater currency stability
An international currency is the most obvious solution
The euro originated from the harmful effects of international currency instability in the wake of the collapse of fixedexchangerate regimes in the early 
Whenever the dollar was weak capital surged into alternative currencies notably the Japanese yen and the German Mark
But exchangerate appreciation put great strain on the export industries that were central to these countries economic performance and both countries tried desperately to avoid becoming reserve currencies
Today the major eneficiaries  in fact victims  of dollar doubts are economies that are much smaller than Japan or Germany
Nowadays capital flows are driving up the Swiss franc the Swedish and Norwegian krone and the Canadian and Australian dollars causing profound dislocations in these small economies as their products and services become uncompetitive
The managers of these new safehaven currencies are now desperately seeking at least a temporary peg or some system of bands relative to the exchange rates of their big neighbors
Such a policy is fraught with danger indeed it is inherently selfdefeating as the establishment of a peg or a band provides an obvious target against which speculators can take huge positions
The current turmoil eventually will lead smaller European countries to look for ways to tie themselves much more closely to the euro
That is what happened in the  during the original wave of currency turmoil the Scandinavians and the Swiss negotiated to associate themselves with a European currency regime
Today the logic of that strategy has become even more compelling
The benefits of euro membership are also clear to many other small economies
Slovenia which entered the eurozone in  and Slovakia which joined at the beginning of   just as the cresting financial crisis slammed shut the door to further euro enlargement  have enjoyed much greater financial stability than their untied neighbors
Part of those neighbors problem was that domestic borrowing costs looked so high that many small borrowers including many house buyers turned to lowinterest Swissfranc loans and were then hit by the franc massive appreciation
The turbulence reinforces the lesson  fundamental to the rationale of establishing the euro  that ordinary people and businesses should not be exposed to exchangerate risk
Even in larger countries the costs and benefits of membership in a currency union are under renewed consideration
In the initial aftermath of the financial crisis it was widely assumed that currency flexibility gave the United Kingdom an advantage over eurozone members like Spain
But Spanish exports recovered more quickly than British exports and inflationary pressure via the exchange rate is now a major constraint on future British monetary policy
Of course there are obvious governance problems with the eurozone
Most glaringly the question of how to allocate the costs of some member countries unsustainable debt overhang has not been adequately addressed
It is easy to conclude that no one is in charge not the national governments and certainly not the ineffective European Commission in Brussels with which the large member countries seem to be practically at war
And yet paradoxically the absence of control is what makes the euro attractive
Unlike the US dollar there is no obvious way to put pressure on the European Central Bank to depreciate the currency in order to obtain a competitive advantage over other economies
European governments are not in a position to instruct the ECB to purchase government bonds
The more the eurozone ineffective governance is criticized the greater becomes the euro importance as a nonpolitical currency that represents a secure store of value
In a stable world of confident markets small countries can rest easy with their own monetary regimes
In a turbulent world of market volatility however they risk being overwhelmed
There is thus a surprising resilience in the European project
A bundle of logs lashed together in a raft  even if it lacks a rudder  has a clear advantage over a single stormtossed trunk
The higher the waves of doubt and uncertainty become the more the common approach is needed
A Breach in the Eurozone Dike
PRINCETON  While all eyes have been on the European periphery has the core been cracking
The Bundesbank has lowered its forecast for German annual GDP growth in  to 
The Central Bank of the Netherlands expects Dutch GDP to shrink by  this year following a contraction of about  in 
The eurozone crisis may be entering its third stage
In the first stage beginning in the spring of  the locus of the North Atlantic crisis moved from the United States to the eurozone
Banks in the eurozone came under pressure and interbank tensions increased
In the second stage starting in the spring of  the crisis spread to the sovereigns as investors grew increasingly worried that propping up banks would strain government finances
In turn sovereign weakness made the banks appear riskier and the banks and their home governments became joined at the hip
Throughout the crisis it has been widely assumed  at least so far  that the eurozone core would remain solid and would continue to write the checks for the periphery distressed governments and banks
That assumption appeared plausible
A wospeed Europe was the new normal
In particular Germany stood above the fray
Following strong performance in  Germany GDP exceeded precrisis levels by early  a somewhat better achievement than that of the US
Indeed given Germany surprisingly impressive employment performance another Wirtschaftswunder appeared to be in the making
Then a subtle change occurred
The US  despite a historically slow return to normalcy pulled ahead of Germany
Absent a prolonged fiscalcliff and debtceiling mess the US may be cobbling together a sustainable recovery
Following the German economy sharp contraction in the last quarter of  the question for the country today is whether it can avoid a technical recession defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction
Europe does not have its own growth engine
The German rebound was initially robust because world trade rose rapidly after a precipitous fall
China voracious appetite for German cars and machines provided the needed boost even as Germany traditional trade partners in Europe struggled
Since then however Chinese demand growth has slowed and Germany European trading partners are in even deeper trouble
Fiscal austerity in the periphery requires cutting back on imports hence the countries exporting to the periphery need to curtail their own imports  and so the process cascades
This trade multiplier is causing European economies to drag each other down and the rest of the world is feeling the effects
The Dutch economy poor prospects are similarly alarming
The Netherlands is second only to Germany in the volume of credit that it channels through the socalled arget  system to the eurozone periphery and it is the periphery largest creditor in per capita terms
Economic forecasters continue to promise that growth will revive
Things will begin to look up in the second half of  we are told
But the track record of charting this recovery has been discouraging
In his book The Signal and the Noise the American statistician Nate Silver says that forecasters perform worst when faced with a circumstance that they have not encountered before
This is such a circumstance
In April  the International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook projected  annual GDP growth in Germany and the Netherlands in 
In October of last year the IMF lowered its  growth forecast for Germany to  and to  for the Netherlands
And a mere two months later both countries central banks report that even these reduced expectations are too optimistic
Who is to say that the second half of  will bring more hope and cheer
The European crisismanagement process has been predicated on the Scarlett Oara principle that omorrow will be a better day
Although everyone knows that postponing hard decisions only makes the problem larger they could still believe that there would always be a firm line of defense
That may be changing
The third stage of the eurozone crisis will arrive when the economic strength of the core is in doubt
Those very doubts undermine the credibility of the safety net that has been supporting the European periphery
A solution to the eurozone crisis that relies on Germany has always been politically uncertain
It may soon become economically untenable
The Everlasting Schism
Christianitys holiest days always seem to incite fresh disputes between Roman Catholicism and Russian Orthodoxy between the first Rome and the third Rome
This Easter is no different
Whats new this time is that the current storm came out of the blue
Last year Russias Patriarch Aleksei gave his blessing to a visit to Moscow by the Catholic girls choir of the Saint Danilov monastery
Soon after and more importantly the Patriarch raised the level of Orthodoxys representation at an ecumenical prayer called by Pope John Paul II in Assisi on January  th 
This was to be followed by a visit to Moscow by a senior Vatican cleric Cardinal Walter Kasper President of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity and the man who helped organize last years papal visits to Ukraine Kazakhstan and Armenia
An invitation for the Pope to visit Moscow a cherished dream of John Paul II seemed near at last
This budding goodwill ended when the Vatican announced plans to reorganize Catholic structures overseas including within Russia
A Roman Catholic archdiocese headed by either a Cardinal or Archbishop was to be created for Moscow
Four other apostolic districts in Russia were to be turned into dioceses
These changes were intended to grant greater opportunities for Catholic believers according to Dr Joaquin NavarroValls the Vatican press officer
The popes press secretary called this a matter of mere technical change with nothing to do with proselytism
Similar measures indeed had recently been undertaken by the Moscow Patriach in relation to Orthodox parishes in Berlin Vienna and Brussels
Moscows reaction was quick and withering
Archbishop Clement of Kaluga and Borovsk the vicechairman of Department for External Church Relations declared that the actions outlined by the Vatican are in contravention of the canonical principles and norms of interchurch relations and stand as a serious obstacle to the development of dialogue between the two churches
Soon after Cardinal Kaspers visit was canceled
Not to be outdone Russias foreign ministry joined the fray
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov expressed regret at the Vaticans actions and for the first time in many years failed to make the obligatory call on the Holy See on his trip to Rome this March
A resolution to save Orthodoxy was rushed through the Duma and street protests aimed at the papal nuncio took place
All of this was taking place around the time that Pope John Paul II was making a virtual pilgrimage to Moscow via the internet
This was accomplished through a televised transmission which connected the Apostolic Palace of the Vatican with the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Moscow
Speaking on gigantic television screens Karol Wojtyla blessed Catholic believers in Russian
But this rather innocuous meeting did not go off without problems as until the very last moment the customs office at Moscows international airport refused to approve the import of electronic equipment for the televised transmission
Why is it that at a time when America and Russia can begin to work together Catholicism and Orthodoxy prefer to keep going after each others throats
The current crisis has actually been burning underground for some time and has broken to the surface now because the Moscow Patriarchate fears that there is a real possibility that John Paul II will be invited by President Putin to visit Russia on governmental matters
The Pope will be invited as a head of state the Vatican not in his spiritual capacity
A stick with which to beat back any instinct in the Kremlin to issue such an invitation was needed by the Patriarch and so the Vaticans decision to reorganize its dioceses in Russia must have seemed a godsend
The leadership of the Orthodox Church does not want to see the current Roman pontiff ever invited to Russia and appear to be awaiting his replacement as the head of the Holy See
Why is this
First because the next pope will almost certainly not be Polish  indeed is unlikely to be any sort of Slav
Second the next Pope will not be endowed initially with such enormous moral authority as John Paul II has acquired across the world and so the Patriarch will be able to speak publicly with him and be measured against him on something more like equal terms
The sharp reactions of the Orthodox Patriarchate to the actions of the Holy See reflect an ongoing crisis of leadership and legitimacy within the Russian Orthodox church where a battle is clearly underway for the succession of Aleksey II
After almost a century of oppression the Orthodox Church is still struggling to define its role in Russias postcommunist society and finds it difficult to compete with more nimble and selfassured churches
Moreover although younger than John Paul II Patriarch Aleksey II has entered his own autumn of the patriarch
Sad to say reconciliation between the two churches is thus unlikely to gain momentum until two new leaders begin to command their believers
The Evita Syndrome
On the day last month that Argentina commemorated the th anniversary of the death of Eva Pern patron saint of the descamisados and of jobs for everyone the worst unemployment rate in the countrys history  was announced
Four years of recession and devaluation of the peso has seen Argentina descend into a veritable economic hell
Only a head of householdone third of the populationmay draw monthly government assistance equal to  per day
This amount cannot begin to cover basic needs
More than  million people  of the population live in poverty
The middle class continues to cling to the hope that their savings can be salvaged but these funds which are now frozen in the nations banks are unlikely ever to be at anyones disposal
Under the rule of President Carlos Menem who rid the country of inflation and opened the economy to the world Argentina became the darling of international investors and institutions
After half a century of stagnation Menem looked good
But Argentina a society that historically lacked the means to defend itself against authoritarianism has long been the agreeable victim of populist and autocratic rulers
So it was not hard to convince such a nation that  menemismo  was the price that had to be paid to become a member of the first world
Shopping sprees by the rich and famous became synonymous with popular approval for the corruption legal impunity and frivolity that surrounded Menems cronies and his sales of state assets
The countrys already thin social fabric frayed
In the end shopping sprees could not keep reality at bay
After Menem handed over the presidential sash to Fernando De la Rua Argentina began to unravel President de la Rua resigned his office well before the official end of his term
Four temporary heads of state later Eduardo Duhalde a senator and powerful peronista chieftain is now trying to hold the country together
To the three constitutionally established branches of government executive legislative and judicial a fourth power has been added the provincial governors the barons of peronismo 
Determined to carry on as they always have no matter what the governors turn a deaf ear to the IMF and resist instituting fiscal reforms
Many have their sights set on the presidency
The real titleholders of internal power the governors owe their long incumbencies to the generosity with which they hand out state jobs
At times charming at times eccentric and often behaving like bandits these provincial chieftains share several attributes high rates of poverty in their provinces comfortable lifestyles for themselves and a disdain for democratic institutions
Their misrule has made Argentina into a kind of global pariah
Because of them we wont pay our debts or reform the financial system
Poverty grows and the indecisive Peronista government governors included inspires little trust
Argentina cannot hope to reach an accommodation with the IMF so long as these officials retain a virtual veto
The call to schedule elections for March of next year although demanded by most Argentines has failed to calm nerves
Everyone knows that lacking a true opposition to the current government the presidential candidate will emerge from todays divided and fragmented brand of peronismo 
But the only remaining vestige of Perns rule is embodied in the worst habits of his heirs who with the least provocation demonstrate their propensity for authoritarianism demagoguery and a mentality always favorable to corruption
Indeed todays peronismo  known officially as the Partido Justicialista unites individuals only in a desire to perpetuate their power
Everything they do turns on this including the hatred between Menem and Duhalde
In November the party will hold open internal talks an occasion that will increase competition between each governor
Their differences are slight
There is the progressive feudalism of the governor of the depopulated Patagonian province of Santa Cruz the feudal populism of Adolfo Rodrguez Sa briefly the countrys president during last Decembers saga of successive presidential resignations
Rodrguez Sa is also the exgovernor of San Luis where he governed with a sure despotic hand for  yearsa reign the poor endured because he bribed them as well
There is also the liberalism of Jos Manuel de la Sota who steered the indebted province of Crdoba and who is President Eduardo Duhaldes dauphin
Finally casting a long shadow over everything is Menem
Although hectored by criminal accusations and the discovery of a Swiss bank account in his name he is trying to rise above scandal to recapture the presidency
One newspaper refers to this political infighting as the peronista carnage
First to fall victim was Carlos Reuteman the exbacker of Formula  auto racing who is now governor of Santa Fe
The first anointed dauphin of President Duhalde Reutemans joy at this prospect was shortlived
He declined to put himself forward his exit speech reviving memories of Argentinas dirty war and disappeared I have seen something that I cannot discuss and may never be able to discuss
Argentines are left to endure wretched hours languishing in economic and political chaos
People in the streets increasingly fear that they will never get to cast their ballot or have their say
The Evolving Structure of Global Growth
NEW YORK  Since World War II end the global economy trade and financial openness has increased thanks to institutions like the International Monetary Fund and successive rounds of liberalization starting with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATT in 
In parallel colonialism collapsed and we are now slightly more than halfway through a centurylong process of modernization for the many developing countries that emerged
But where has that process led where is it taking us now and perhaps most importantly how can we influence its course
With formal barriers to trade and capital flows lowered several trends combined to accelerate growth and structural change in postcolonial and other developing economies
These included advances in technology especially in transportation and communications management innovation in multinational companies and integration of these companies supply chains
Thus in the early postwar period developing countries whose exports had previously consisted mainly of natural resources and agricultural products expanded into laborintensive manufacturing
Textiles and apparel came first followed by luggage dishes toys etc
Supply chains also dispersed geographically with lower valueadded components and processes allocated to lowincome countries
In consumer electronics for example lowincome countries became a natural location for laborintensive assembly processes
But semiconductors circuit boards and other components were designed and manufactured in high middleincome countries like Korea
Although the shifting structure of the global economy is best described as a journey taken only once growth in developing countries does exhibit repeating patterns
Powerful economic forces drive the structural evolution and economic diversification that underpin growth producing transitions that have common elements
For example after more than  years of rapid growth China is entering a iddleincome transition
Over time laborintensive components of valueadded chains will move away from China higherincome areas
Helped by massive public investment in infrastructure and logistical capabilities some of this work will move inland where incomes are lower
Eventually however laborintensive activities will move to countries at earlier stages of development while China moves up the value chain both in the export sector and with rising incomes in production for domestic consumption
But this middleincome transition is sometimes deemed a trap
Indeed most countries entering middleincome transitions see their growth slow even stall
Of the  postwar cases of sustained high growth soon to be  with the addition of India and Vietnam only five economies  Japan Korea Taiwan Hong Kong and Singapore  have maintained high growth rates through the middleincome transition and proceeded toward advancedcountry income levels of  per capita or above
All of this structural change is part of a constantly shifting global economic landscape whose aggregate pattern is not perfectly predictable in part because countries enter and engage with the global economy at different times and expand at different rates
Early highgrowth economies  Japan South Korea Taiwan  initially exported laborintensive products then graduated to more capitalintensive goods like motor vehicles and then to humancapitalintensive activities like design and technology development
As wages rose Japan old laborintensive activities migrated to later arrivals in the global economy
China accelerated to a highgrowth pattern in the late  and early  owing to the benefits of its lowcost labor and a major change in economic policy
But no one anticipated China abrupt shift away from a closed centrally planned economy to a more open marketoriented one with expanded economic freedom for individuals and enterprises alike
As emergingmarket economies shift to higher valueadded components in global supply chains their physical human and institutional capital deepen
This brings their structure closer to that of the advanced countries introducing greater competition in what was once the advanced countries sole territory  the most sophisticated of valueadded goods and services
At this point countries arrive at a crossroads
The aggregate size of the developing countries especially the major emerging economies their rising incomes and their ongoing movement up the value chain are having a growing impact on advancedcountry economies particularly these economies tradable sectors
What is the impact on a large advanced country like the United States
Some  of the  million net new jobs created in the US since  have been in the nontradable sector  dominated by government health care retail hospitality and real estate
Given longterm constraints on both fiscal and household spending in the wake of the financial crisis and downward pressure on asset prices the sustainability of such an employment trend is questionable
Indeed the postcrisis shortfall in domestic demand is causing stubbornly high unemployment even as the economy recovers some of its growth momentum
In principle foreign demand especially in highgrowth emerging markets could make up some of the difference
But that has not happened  at least not yet
Although the US trade deficit fell to  billion in  from  billion in  the adjustment came entirely from a sharp decline in imports from  trillion to  trillion whereas exports actually fell slightly from  trillion to  trillion
Growth in exports could come with further expansion in parts of the valueadded chains where the US is already competitive finance insurance and computer systems design for example
But the scope of the export sector itself will have to expand in order to generate sufficient employment and reduce the external deficit
That will require restoring and creating competitiveness in an expanded set of valueadded components in the tradable sector
It would be nice if there were an easy and reasonably certain way to accomplish that
But there isn and protectionism is certainly not the answer
It is a complex challenge for any country one that calls for a multipronged approach to heightening investment in human capital the technological base of the economy and infrastructure
The ExchangeRate Delusion
MILAN  If one looks at the trade patterns of the global economy two biggest players two facts leap out
One is that while the United States runs a trade deficit with almost everyone including Canada Mexico China Germany France Japan South Korea and Taiwan not to mention the oilexporting countries the largest deficit is with China
If trade data were recalculated to reflect the country of origin of various components of valueadded the general picture would not change but the relative magnitudes would higher US deficits with Germany South Korea Taiwan and Japan and a dramatically lower deficit with China
The second fact is that Japan South Korea and Taiwan  all relatively highincome economies  have a large trade surplus with China
Germany has relatively balanced trade with China even recording a modest bilateral surplus in the postcrisis period
The US has a persistent overall trade deficit that fluctuates in the range of  of GDP
But while the total reflects bilateral deficits with just about everyone the US Congress is obsessed with China and appears convinced that the primary cause of the problem lies in Chinese manipulation of the renminbi exchange rate
One problem with this view is that it cannot account for the stark differences between the US and Japan Germany and South Korea
Moreover the real inflationadjusted value of the renminbi is now rising quickly owing to inflation differentials and Chinese wage growth particularly in the country export sectors
That will shift the Chinese economy structure and trade patterns quite dramatically over time
The finalassembly links of globalvalue added chains will leave China for countries at earlier stages of economic development such as Bangladesh where incomes are lower though without producing much change in the balance with the US
A somewhat more sensible concern might be that the dollar reservecurrency status causes it to be vervalued with respect to every currency not just the renminbi
That could create additional pressure on the tradable part of the US economy and thus might help to explain why the US tradable sector has not generated net employment for two decades
But in order to explain performance relative to Japan and Germany one would have to argue that the euro and the yen have been undervalued which makes no sense
In fact the employment generated by the tradable sector has been in services at the upper end of the distributions of valueadded per person education and income
As a result growth and employment in the tradable sector have gone separate ways with healthy growth and stagnant employment
In Germany by contrast the tradable sector is an employment engine
The same is true of Japan
The US economy distinctive features for at least a decade prior to the crisis that began in  were an unsustainably high level of consumption owing to an illusory wealth effect underinvestment including in the public sector and savings that fell short of the investment deficiency
That excess household and government consumption fueled the domestic economy  and much of the global economy as well
In several European countries that now confront fiscal and growth challenges the pattern was somewhat different most of the excess consumption and employment was on the government side
But the effect was similar an unsustainable pattern of income and employment generation and lower productivity and competitiveness in these economies tradable sectors leading to trade deficits stunted GDP and weak job creation
One could argue that the euro has been and still is overvalued and that this has hindered many eurozone economies productivity relative to noneurozone countries
But the relative productivity deficiencies within the eurozone are more important for growth and have nothing to do with the exchange rate
The focus on currencies as a cause of the West economic woes while not entirely misplaced has been excessive
Developing countries have learned over time that real income growth and employment expansion are driven by productivity gains not exchangerate movements
This in turn requires public and private investment in tangible assets physical and telecommunications infrastructure human capital and skills and the knowledge and technology base of the economy
Of course it is possible for a country terms of trade to get out of line with income and productivity levels requiring a rebalancing
But resetting the terms of trade is no substitute for tackling the structural underpinnings of productivity
None of this is peculiar to developing countries
Underinvestment has longterm costs and consequences everywhere
Excess consumption merely hides these costs temporarily
In the US productivity deficiencies have led to a pattern of disconnection from global supply chains
So the challenge for America is not only to restore productivity but also to restore its links to the main currents of world trade
China growth  and more generally that of the major emerging economies  provides a substantial potential tailwind
That is certainly true nowadays for Germany Japan and South Korea
The US and others can take advantage of it as well but only if productivity relative to income levels in specific areas of potential competitiveness begin to risenbsp
As long as America economic policy remains focused primarily on deficits domestic demand exchange rates and backsliding on trade openness its investment deficiencies will remain unaddressed
That means that its employment and incomedistribution problems will remain unaddressed as well
The good news is that at a deep level incentives across advanced and developing countries are aligned
The emerging economies would like nothing more than the restoration of sustainable patterns of growth in the advanced economies and are prepared to be cooperative players in that process
But focusing on these countries exchange rates is not the right way to go about it
Europe Crisis of Values
NEW YORK  Xenophobia and extremism are symptoms of societies in profound crisis
In  the farright Golden Dawn won  seats in Greece parliamentary election the rightwing Jobbik gained ground in my native Hungary and the National Front Marine Le Pen received strong backing in France presidential election
Growing support for similar forces across Europe points to an inescapable conclusion the continent prolonged financial crisis is creating a crisis of values that is now threatening the European Union itself
When it was only an aspiration the European Union was an immensely attractive idea that fired many people imagination including mine
I regarded it as the embodiment of an open society  a voluntary association of sovereign states that were willing to give up part of their sovereignty for the common good
They shared a common history in which the French Revolution with its slogan of liberty equality and fraternity left a lasting legacy
Building on that tradition member states formed a union based on equality and not dominated by any state or nationality
The euro crisis has now turned the EU into something radically different
Far from being a voluntary association the eurozone is now held together by harsh discipline far from being an association of equals it has become a hierarchical arrangement in which the center dictates policy while the periphery is increasingly subordinated instead of fraternity and solidarity hostile stereotypes proliferate
The integration process was spearheaded by a small group of farsighted statesmen who subscribed to opensociety principles and practiced what Karl Popper called iecemeal social engineering
They recognized that perfection is unattainable so they set limited objectives and firm timelines  and then mobilized the political will for a small step forward knowing full well that when they achieved it its inadequacy would become apparent requiring further steps
That is how the European Coal and Steel Community was gradually transformed into the EU
France and Germany used to be in the forefront of the effort
As the Soviet empire disintegrated Germany leaders recognized that German reunification was possible only in the context of a more united Europe and they were prepared to make considerable sacrifices to achieve it
When it came to bargaining the Germans were willing to contribute a little more and take a little less than others thereby facilitating agreement
At the time German statesmen would assert that Germany had no independent foreign policy only a European one
This stance led to a dramatic acceleration in European integration culminating in the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty in  and the introduction of the euro in 
A period of consolidation which included the introduction of euro banknotes and coins in  followed
Then came the crash of  which originated in the United States but caused greater problems in Europe than anywhere else
Policymakers responded to the collapse of Lehman Brothers by announcing that no other systemically important financial institution would be allowed to fail which required substituting state credit for frozen markets
Shortly thereafter however German Chancellor Angela Merkel asserted that such guarantees had to be provided by each state individually not by Europe collectively
That marked the beginning of the euro crisis because it exposed a flaw in the single currency of which neither the authorities nor financial markets were aware  and which is still not fully recognized today
By creating the European Central Bank the member states exposed their own government bonds to the risk of default
Developed countries that issue bonds in their own currency never default because they can always print money
Their currency may depreciate but the risk of default is absent
By contrast less developed countries that borrow in foreign currencies may run out of currency reserves
When a fiscal crisis hit Greece the financial world suddenly discovered that eurozone members had put themselves in the position of developing countries
There is a close parallel between the euro crisis and the Latin American debt crisis of  when the International Monetary Fund saved the international financial system by lending just enough money to the heavily indebted countries to enable them to avoid default
But the IMF imposed strict austerity on these countries pushing them into a prolonged depression
Latin America suffered a lost decade
Today Germany is playing the same role as the IMF did then
The setting differs but the effect is the same
The euro crisis pushed the financial system to the verge of bankruptcy which has been avoided by imposing strict austerity and lending countries like Greece just enough money to avoid default
As a result the eurozone has become divided into creditors and debtors with the creditors in charge of economic policy
There is a center led by Germany and a periphery consisting of the heavily indebted countries
The creditors imposition of strict austerity on the periphery is perpetuating the eurozone division between center and periphery
Economic conditions are continuing to deteriorate causing immense human suffering
The innocent frustrated and angry victims of austerity provide fertile ground for hate speech xenophobia and all forms of extremism
Thus policies designed to preserve the financial system and the euro are transforming the EU into the opposite of an open society
There is an apparent contradiction between the euro financial requirements and the EU political objectives
The financial requirements could be met by replicating the arrangements that prevailed in the global economy in the  and dividing the eurozone into a center and periphery but that could not be reconciled with the principles of an open society
There are ways in which the policies pursued to preserve the euro could be modified to meet the EU political objectives
For example individual countries government bonds could be replaced by Eurobonds
But insofar as the contradiction remains the political objectives ought to take precedence
Unfortunately that is not the case
The financial problems are pressing  and monopolizing politicians attention
Europe leaders are so preoccupied with the crisis of the day that they have no time to ponder the longterm consequences of their actions
As a result they continue on a course that perpetuates the division between center and periphery
This is such a dismal prospect that it must not be allowed to happen
Originally the EU was conceived as an instrument of solidarity and cooperation
Today it is held together by grim necessity
That is not the Europe we want or need
We must reverse this intolerable transformation
We must find a way to recapture the spirit of solidarity and shared values that once inspired the European imagination
The Endangered Arab Christian
BRUSSELS  The recent abductions of Syriac Orthodox Archbishop Yohanna Ibrahim and his Greek Orthodox counterpart Paul Yazigi reflect not only the increasing brutality of Syria civil war but also the escalating crisis for Christians across the Arab world  one that could end up driving them away altogether
According to the International Society for Human Rights  of all acts of religious persecution worldwide in  were directed at Christians
This surge in discrimination against Christian communities in countries where they have lived for many centuries can be explained largely by increasing Islamist militancy and the rise of political Islam in the wake of the Arab Spring
As Islamist parties have taken power in the region a wave of intimidation and discrimination has been unleashed on Christian minority populations
For example on February  at a garment market in Benghazi Libya members of a powerful Islamist militia rounded up dozens of Egyptian Coptic Christians  identified by crosses tattooed on their right wrists  whom they then detained tortured and threatened with execution
Among the victims was a Coptic priest whom the captors beat severely before shaving his head and moustache
Priests have also been assaulted in Tripoli and churches have been torched
All of this sends a clear message nonMuslims are not safe in Libya
While Libya has no significant religious minority hundreds of thousands of Egyptians live and work in the country where Christian proselytizing is illegal  and where one can be accused of proselytizing simply for possessing a Bible
But Egypt Muslim Brotherhoodcontrolled government does not seem particularly eager to protect its Christian citizens in Libya it offered only a halfhearted call for the release of its detained citizens
This reflects the similarly deteriorating situation for Christians in Egypt where they account for roughly  of the population
In early April a funeral at St Mark Cathedral the seat of the Coptic Church in Cairo for four Christians killed in sectarian riots days earlier descended into chaos with thousands of mourners attacked as they tried to leave after the service
Police fired tear gas into the compound standing by as those outside the cathedral launched petrol bombs hurled rocks and shot at those inside
At least two died and  were injured in the fivehour clash
Christians blame the Muslim Brotherhood not only for allowing Muslim Egyptians to attack them with impunity but also for permitting  and delivering  incendiary antiChristian rhetoric
For example at an open rally for President Mohamed Morsi last year the cleric Safwat Hegazy warned that Egyptian Muslims would plash blood on Christians who plash water on Morsi legitimacy
In February Egypt Coptic patriarch Pope Tawadros II sharply criticized the country leadership in a televised interview calling the new constitution discriminatory and dismissing Morsi ational dialogues as an empty gesture
This unusually assertive stance reflects rising frustration among Christians as well as the secular and liberal opposition with the Muslim Brotherhood power monopoly
Syria which once welcomed thousands of Christians fleeing wartorn Iraq is experiencing an analogous change as the country increasingly sectarian civil war generates fear and mistrust throughout the population
Although Christians have largely sought to remain neutral in the conflict they have become involved gradually some by taking up arms and others as victims of kidnapping and violence
Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarch Gregorios III recently stated that since  over  Christians have been killed and more than  churches and other Christian institutions schools orphanages and care homes have been damaged or destroyed
Some estimate that  Christians have fled Syria
Furthermore fallout from relentless regional conflict is destabilizing Lebanon a country that offers Christians a constitutional guarantee of political representation
Some  refugees  many of them Sunni Muslims including fugitive rebels  have poured over the border from Syria exacerbating sectarian tensions and threatening to disrupt Lebanon delicate social and political balance
Given that as Gttingen University Martin Tamcke points out there is no remaining alternative for Christian refugees in the Middle East they are increasingly heading to Europe and North America
If this trend is allowed to continue the Middle East will gradually lose its Christian congregations
In order to prevent such a tragic outcome Western leaders must take a more active role in advocating the protection of Christian minorities throughout the Arab world
Ultimately Christians and Muslims in the Arab world have the same desires freedom dignity and equal rights
Those who are persecuting Christians should recognize that the Arab Spring should benefit all Arabs
The Extinction Puzzle
With six billion humans and counting  and our individual consumption growing  we face enormous challenges in using our natural resources sustainably
And there is one clear measure of how we perform at that task extinction rates
For this reason some colleagues and I have calculated the rate at which bird species became extinct in the recent past and the rate at which they will likely become extinct in the future 
Bird extinctions are our best window onto humanity massive and irreversible environmental impact
For every one of the world  bird species there may be  or perhaps even  other unknown species of animals plants or fungi
Birds popularity means that they provide an unrivaled source of information about which species live where and how well those species are doing
Estimates of the number of extinctions have tended to vary wildly owing to differences in the assumed total number of species which range from the one million species that have scientific names to an implausibly high estimate of  million species
To avoid such uncertainties my colleagues and I introduced the 
 extinction rate
  the number of extinctions per year per species or to make the numbers more reasonable extinctions per million speciesyears  EMSY
With the exception of the past five mass extinction events estimates from the fossil record suggest that an approximate background rate is one extinction per million speciesyears  EMSY
For the  bird species there should only be one extinction in each century 
Before European exploration the Polynesian expansion across the Pacific probably exterminated species at the rate of one every year or two which is  to  times more extinctions than should occur naturally
For example parrots rails and doves once occured across the Pacific on sufficiently large islands
Those islands that have been well explored archaeologically yield bones of species the Polynesians exterminated while the islands now lack them
We can predict which islands were likely large enough to have once supported unique species and so estimate how many species are missing
The total is nearly 
We have yet to do comparable analyses on the fate of Caribbean and Indian Ocean islands following first human contact but it is likely that large numbers of extinctions occurred there too 
Early European exploration likely continued this rapid pace of extinction
The number of species known to have expired between  and  is increasing as taxonomists describe new species from skeletal remains they find in caves for example where bones survive
These searches are far from complete
Linneaus invented the modern process of naming species in the mid although naming did not get under way until the peace following Napoleon Bonaparte defeat in 
Whereas bird taxonomists had described only  bird species by  in the next  years they described about  more
This means that most of what we know about birds and their extinctions dates from the 
To get an accurate picture of extinction we must adjust the total number of extinctions for the length of time science has known bird species
A second adjustment is necessary because conservationists follow the principle that a species survives even if it is not recently recorded in its native habitat
This assumption prevents terminating conservation efforts prematurely even as it underestimates the total number of extinctions
We added species that are probably extinct too
With these two adjustments the extinction rate has been about a  times higher than natural over the last two centuries
Our predictions of twentyfirst century extinctions jump an order of magnitude to  EMSY
Not only are  of bird species already in danger of extinction but more than twice that proportion have small geographical ranges the key predictor of threat and mostly live in habitats that are seriously threatened
Tropical forests for example hold the majority of bird species  and likely most other kinds of species too
If present trends of deforestation continue we project bird extinction rates to climb to  EMSY by the last decades of this century
Moreover our calculations are conservative as they do not include extinctions caused by invasive species the expansion of human technologies such as the longline fishing that harms many seabirds or global warming
All would increase our estimates
Likewise birds are poor models for other kinds of species because public concern over birds generally leads to rapid actions to save them
Indeed we showed that aggressive conservation actions have reduced bird extinction rates over the last few decades to about  EMSY  still very high but down sharply from the  EMSY projected were conservation actions not in place
Certainly some other species also benefit from the protections that we afford birds but many other species do not
Moreover human actions threaten substantially higher proportions of other wellknown groups  such as flowering plants and amphibians
Our results show that conservation efforts 
 can
 reduce the irreversible loss of biodiversity
Nevertheless future rates of extinction constitute a problem that will be very much harder to solve
The Extremists Unbound
JERUSALEM  The pattern of policymaking in the Middle East as it was defined since President Bush xis if evil speech of January  is undergoing a momentous change of direction
Bush foreignpolicy paradigm of an alliance of oderates to defeat the xtremists  a model too enthusiastically seconded by an unimaginative Israeli leadership and by those Arabs led by Egypt and Saudi Arabia who dread the forces of radical change  has collapsed
The xtremists whom Bush expected to be defeated through economic sanctions diplomatic isolation and military action have prevailed
It is the oderates who must now adapt their policies
Israel and the United States failed resoundingly in their attempt to dislodge Hamas from Gaza or in forcing it to accept conditions for an end to the international boycott
Fearing the costs of an invasion of Gaza urban alleys Israel handed a strategic victory to Hamas
It accepted a truce brokered by an Egyptian government fearful of Iran influence in neighboring Gaza that not only gave Hamas political legitimacy and undermined the international community policy of not negotiating with this fundamentalist group but that also allowed it to continue rearming
Indeed Hamas now poses a strategic threat to Israel urban centers and military facilities
Israel war in  in Lebanon against Hezbollah supported by the US and the entire Arab oderate camp was no more successful
In fact Hezbollah is now not only militarily stronger than ever  Security Council Resolution  which called for its disarmament has proven to be an utter failure  but also more politically robust than before the war
Admirably adept at weaving together all of Lebanon political religious and nationalists threads Hezbollah leader Hassan Nazrallah is today the undisputed master of Lebanon
The Syrian patron of Hezbollah President Bashar alAssad another member of the xis of evil is also doing well thank you
Not only Israel and the US but also Egypt and Saudi Arabia have hoped for the political demise of this friend of every radical regional cause  from Hamas and Iran to the antiWestern forces in Lebanon  that they oppose
But Assad managed to emerge from Syria forced withdrawal from Lebanon in  to become the broker without whom a Lebanese government could not be created and a president could not be elected
This and the indirect negotiations with Israel that are now underway in Turkey  which Assad knows cannot produce major results given Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert political weakness and Bush lameduck status  have helped to open for Syria the gates of Europe where he had also once been a pariah
Moreover desperate to recover its relevance in Middle East politics the US has now radically changed its attitude and agreed to a meeting between US Undersecretary of State for Near East Affairs David Welch and Riad Daoudi Syria chief negotiator with Israel
America drive to force Iran to stop its nuclear program through an ineffective sanctions regime has been no more successful than any of its other schemes to isolate the region extremists
Indeed the US has now completely reversed its position of not negotiating with Iran until it stops uranium enrichment
The participation of Under Secretary of State William Burns in the European dialogue with Iran together with plans to station American diplomats in Teheran for the first time since the  Islamic Revolution represents a momentous shift in America policy and also an indication to Israel to refrain from a military strike
Bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan America is in no mood to open a third front against the Islamic world
The consequences of an Israeli attack on Iran ould be extremely stressful for us warned Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Michael Mullen
With the defeat of his ideologically inspired foreign policy Bush has finally decided not to remain blind to the benefits of engaging Syria and Iran
However isolated within the Arab family the Syrians may be and however embattled their Iranian allies are the two countries hold the keys to Middle East stability
They are crucial players in Lebanon they have a role to play in pacifying Iraq they can influence a change of attitude of powerful and extremely destabilizing nonstate actors like Hamas and Hezbollah and their leverage on Hamas is vital for the stability of the Palestinian front
Engaging Iran is also the only way to stave off a nuclear apocalypse in the region
Of course the overall cooling of political tensions reflects the collapse of another misconception of the Bush administration  that the xis of evil is an irrational coalition interested only in spreading evil
Pursuing radical goals does not necessarily mean that a country will act irrationally
Neither Syria nor Iran  in fact not even North Korea  has an interest in being the pariahs of the world community and they fully understand the economic consequences of isolation
Their policies are about more than spreading terror and revolution they are about promoting negotiable interests
They are both mindful of the limits of the politics of destabilization and they are clearly looking forward to a more dialogueoriented American administration willing to address their political and strategic concerns
The Face of Evil
NEW YORK  Standing with Slobodan Milosevic  years ago on the veranda of a government hunting lodge outside Belgrade I saw two men in the distance
They left their twin Mercedes and in fading light started toward us
I felt a jolt go through my body they were unmistakable
Ratko Mladic in combat fatigues stocky walking as though through a muddy field and Radovan Karadzic taller wearing a suit with his wild but carefully coiffed shock of white hair
The capture of Karadzic and his arrival at the war crimes tribunal in The Hague took me back to a long night of confrontation drama and negotiations  the only time I ever met him
It was  pm on September   during the height of the war in Bosnia
After years of weak Western and United Nations response to Serb aggression and ethnic cleansing of Muslims and Croats in Bosnia United Statesled NATO bombing had put the Serbs on the defensive
Our small diplomatic negotiating team was trying to end a war that had taken the lives of nearly  people
Milosevic Mladic and Karadzic were the primary reason for that war
Mladic and Karadzic had already been indicted as war criminals by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia
Milosevic was not to be indicted until 
In a change of strategy the negotiating team had decided to marginalize Karadzic and Mladic and to force Milosevic as the senior Serb in the region to take responsibility for the war and for the negotiations that we hoped would end it
Now Milosevic wanted to bring the two men back into the discussions probably to take some of the pressure off of himself
We had anticipated this moment and agreed in advance that while we would never ask to meet with Karadzic and Mladic if Milosevic offered such a meeting we would accept  but only once and only under strict guidelines that would require Milosevic to be responsible for their behavior
I told each member of our negotiating team to decide for himself or herself whether to shake hands with the mass murderers
I hated these men for what they had done
Their crimes included indirectly the deaths of three of our colleagues  Bob Frasure Joe Kruzel and Nelson Drew who had died when the armored personnel carrier they were in plunged down a ravine as we attempted to reach Sarajevo by the only route available a dangerous dirt road that went through sniperfilled Serbiancontrolled territory
I did not shake hands although both Karadzic and Mladic tried to
Some of our team did others did not
Mladic not Karadzic was the dominant figure that evening
He engaged in staring contests with some of our team as we sat across the table
Karadzic was silent at first
He had a large face with heavy jowls a soft chin and surprisingly gentle eyes
When he heard our demand that the siege of Sarajevo be lifted immediately he exploded
Rising from the table the Americaneducated Karadzic raged in passable English about the umiliations his people were suffering
I reminded Milosevic that he had promised that such harangues would not occur
Karadzic responded emotionally that he would call former President Jimmy Carter with whom he said he was in touch and started to leave
For the only time that long night I addressed Karadzic directly telling him that we worked only for President Bill Clinton and that he could call Carter if he wished but that we would leave and that the bombing would intensify
Milosevic said something to Karadzic in Serbian he sat down again and the meeting got down to business
After ten hours we reached an agreement that would end the siege after more than three years of war
The next day we were able to fly into the reopened airfield in Sarajevo
That indomitable city was already beginning to come back to life
Two months later the war would end at Dayton never to resume
But while the Dayton agreement gave NATO the authority to capture Karadzic and Mladic an arrest didn occur for nearly  years
During that period Karadzic spread a completely false rumor that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and I had made a deal that with Karadzic disappearance from public view NATO would not seek his arrest
Of course this another ridiculous fabrication from the same man who famously said that the Bosnian Muslims had shelled their own villages in order to lure NATO into the war
Finally one of these dreadful murderers is in The Hague
It is imperative that Mladic follow Karadzic on this oneway journey
Karadzic capture is all the more important because Serbian authorities accomplished it
Serbian President Boris Tadic deserves great credit for this action especially since his good friend Zoran Djindjic then prime minister of Serbia was assassinated in  as a direct result of his courage in arresting Milosevic and sending him to The Hague in 
Karadzic arrest is no mere historical footnote it removes from the scene a man who was still undermining peace and progress in the Balkans and whose enthusiastic advocacy of ethnic cleansing merits emphatic repudiation
It also moves Serbia closer to European Union membership
Moreover Karadzic arrest is another reminder of the value of war crimes tribunals
Even though almost  years is an inexcusably long time the war crimes indictment kept Karadzic on the run and prevented him from resurfacing
In faraway Khartoum Sudanese President Omar Hassan alBashir now indicted by the International Criminal Court should be paying close attention
Five Years of Financial NonReform
STANFORD  Five years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered the largest global financial crisis since the Great Depression outsize banking sectors have left economies shattered in Ireland Iceland and Cyprus
Banks in Italy Spain and elsewhere are not lending enough
China credit binge is turning into a bust
In short the world financial system remains dangerous and dysfunctional
Worse despite years of debate no consensus about the nature of the financial system problems  much less how to fix them  has emerged
And that appears to reflect the banks political power
For example Vince Cable the United Kingdom business secretary recently accused Bank of England regulators  whom he called apital Taliban  of holding back the country economic recovery by imposing excessive burdens on banks
Cable appears to believe the banks lobbyists when they claim that lending and growth would suffer if banks were forced to old more capital
Such claims by senior policymakers are hardly unique to the UK but they are false and misleading
Bank capital is not cash reserves that must be et aside it is unborrowed money that can be used to make loans
Simply put lending and economic growth have suffered since  because highly indebted financial institutions could not absorb their losses not because of regulations that sought to reduce their indebtedness
The regulations in place when the crisis erupted were both inadequate and inadequately enforced and the reforms proposed since then do little better
The proposed Basel III reforms for example would allow banks to fund up to  of their assets with borrowed money some investments could be made entirely by borrowed funds
The perils of this approach should be obvious by now
When homeowners cannot pay their mortgages they may lose their house blighting the entire neighborhood
The same is true of financial institutions as the Lehman bankruptcy showed
Moreover the effects of heavy borrowing are felt before borrowers default
Distressed or nderwater homeowners do not invest much in maintenance or improvements
Similarly weak banks with overhanging debts that prevent them from funding worthy investments are a drag on the economy
Flawed regulations further distort weak banks behavior  for example by biasing them in favor of making loans to governments or investing in marketable securities over lending to businesses
Regulators too often tolerate and sometimes support weak banks denying the reality of their dire condition
This is counterproductive
Instead regulators must take forceful steps to unwind zombie banks and compel viable banks to rely more on equity markets where risk is traded and priced to become stronger
Banning payouts to shareholders and requiring banks to raise funds by selling new shares would bolster them without restricting their ability to lend
Banks that cannot sell their shares at any price may be too weak to survive without subsidies
Such banks are dysfunctional and must be unwound
If we want safer and healthier banks there can be no substitute for requiring banks to reduce their reliance on borrowing
As lenders banks lose when borrowers default
Banks themselves however are the heaviest borrowers routinely funding more than   and sometimes more than   of their investments by taking on debt
By contrast nonfinancial corporations rarely borrow more than  of their assets and often much less despite the absence of any regulation of their leverage ratios
Cyprus illustrates the problem
Beginning in  Cypriot banks invested some of their deposits in Greek government bonds which promised interest rates of more than   sometimes even  or 
As long as Greece paid these high rates Cypriot banks could pay their depositors attractive rates such as  and thrive
Cypriot banks passed stress tests in July 
Yet in early  their Greek bonds lost  of their value
Because the banks made their investments with too little unborrowed money they became insolvent
After being kept afloat for a year with help from the European Central Bank the Cypriot banks were forced to face their losses
One was shut
Deposits over   incurred losses
Eurozone taxpayers provided  billion in bailout funds
Remarkably regulators had allowed Cypriot banks to engage in the practices that led to their troubles
Although investing in Greek bonds was risky  reflected in the high rates the bonds promised  the regulations ignored the possibility of a loss
While the upside of the risks played out the banks profits benefited their shareholders and managers politicians were happy and the banks grew enormously relative to the economy
The proposed Basel III regulations set wholly insufficient minimum capital requirements and maintain a failed approach to adjusting the requirements to risk
Within the eurozone for example banks can extend loans to any government using exclusively borrowed money
The FrenchBelgian bank Dexia like Cypriot banks and many others since  failed or were bailed out from losses on risky investments that regulators had considered safe
Regulations everywhere appear to be based on the false notion that banks should have ust enough equity
Equity is not scarce for viable banks and the cience of complex risk weights and stress tests is a harmful illusion
Instead regulation should seek to force banks investors to bear much more of their own risk and thus to care much more about managing it in order to limit the collateral damage of their excessive borrowing
Some say that banks are inherently special because they allocate society savings and create liquidity
In fact banks have become special mainly in their ability to get away with so much gambling at others expense
Nothing about financial intermediation justifies allowing banks to distort the economy and endanger the public as much as they do
Unfortunately despite the enormous harm from the financial crisis little has changed in the politics of banking
Too many politicians and regulators put their own interests and those of heir banks ahead of their duty to protect taxpayers and citizens
We must demand better

The Failure of China Bashing
With Chinas rapid growth increasingly affecting a wide range of issues worldwide it has become expedient for US presidential candidates to blame China for some of Americas domestic problems
But in this years US presidential election campaign China bashing has been virtually nonexistent
There are good reasons for this welcome change
Recent US elections rarely spared China which found itself a frequent target of populist demagoguery
Its exchangerate regime which pegs the Renminbi to the US dollar was blamed for the mounting US trade deficit
Never mind that Americas bilateral trade deficit with China even including Hong Kong accounts for less than onefifth of the total US deficit growing imports from China and more direct investment by US companies supposedly fueled US unemployment
Similarly the unfinished reforms in Chinas banking sector and stateowned enterprises have been used as evidence of state subsidies for dumping activities
Although the majority of Chinas exports now come from private companies that receive virtually no loans from state banks  American candidates in previous elections routinely sought to curry favor with working class voters by vowing to protect US jobs against Chinas supposedly unfair business practices
The jobs issue could be exploited further by citing poor working conditions low wages child labor and other problems commonly found in developing countries
Attacking a communist country has always seemed to offer American politicians a convenient way to appeal to the average voter
After all most US voters can be trusted not to learn how other countries let alone countries in the Far East really work
But this time George W Bush and John Kerry both know that it would be unwise to bash China too hard
American companies and the entire US economy have a huge stake in China now so both candidates have no interest in rocking the boat
A candidate may promise more antidumping actions against Chinese goods vow to press harder on China to change its exchange rate regime or sharpen criticism of Chinas weak enforcement of intellectual property rights but overprotectionism may make a candidate look irresponsible in 
Indeed protectionism can do nothing to reduce Americas trade deficit and stanch domestic unemployment
No matter how much politicians blame others growing US imports mean greater reliance on international markets and some China factor in Americas investment portfolio is needed to compete against European and Japanese firms
There is no hiding these facts from American voters anymore
George W Bush failed to honor his antiChinese protectionist campaign promises of  as did Bill Clinton throughout his presidency
Any Chinabashing and protectionist pleas this time around will most likely ring just as hollow
Moreover Chinas geopolitical importance to the US has grown immensely since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington DC of September  
At least for now engaging China in the global fight against terrorism is in Americas interest
China does have some common interests in fighting Islamic extremist terrorism and it did not try to block Americas path to the Iraqi war in the UN Security Council
China has also been cooperating constructively with the US and its allies in dealing with North Koreas nuclear capabilities
Of course America still wants to contain China and prevent it from becoming a major regional and world power
But that remains a longterm strategic goal not the stuff of presidential campaigns especially when China seems too weak to pose any immediate threat to the US on any front in the foreseeable future
China has never been a positive factor in American politics so from its perspective the less it is mentioned in this US election season the better
The relative silence about China in the US these days may be due merely to the news dominance of the Iraq War
Yet it may also indicate that Americas political elites are in the process of facing up to new realities and adjusting their view of China accordingly
The Failure of Inflation Targeting
New York  The World central bankers are a closeknit club given to fads and fashions
In the early  they fell under the spell of monetarism a simplistic economic theory promoted by Milton Friedman
After monetarism was discredited  at great cost to those countries that succumbed to it  the quest began for a new mantra
The answer came in the form of nflation targeting which says that whenever price growth exceeds a target level interest rates should be raised
This crude recipe is based on little economic theory or empirical evidence there is no reason to expect that regardless of the source of inflation  the best response is to increase interest rates
One hopes that most countries will have the good sense not to implement inflation targeting my sympathies go to the unfortunate citizens of those that do Among the list of those who have officially adopted inflation targeting in one form or another are Israel the Czech Republic Poland Brazil Chile Colombia South Africa Thailand Korea Mexico Hungary Peru the Philippines Slovakia Indonesia Romania New Zealand Canada the United Kingdom Sweden Australia Iceland and Norway
Today inflation targeting is being put to the test  and it will almost certainly fail
Developing countries currently face higher rates of inflation not because of poorer macromanagement but because oil and food prices are soaring and these items represent a much larger share of the average household budget than in rich countries
In China for example inflation is approaching  or more
In Vietnam it is even higher and is expected to approach  this year and in India it is  
By contrast US inflation stands at 
Does that mean that these developing countries should raise their interest rates far more than the US
Inflation in these countries is for the most part imported 
Raising interest rates won have much impact on the international price of grains or fuel
Indeed given the size of the US economy a slowdown there might conceivably have a far bigger effect on global prices than a slowdown in any developing country which suggests that from a global perspective US interest rates not those in developing countries should be raised
So long as developing countries remain integrated into the global economy  and do not take measures to restrain the impact of international prices on domestic prices  domestic prices of rice and other grains are bound to rise markedly when international prices do
For many developing countries high oil and food prices represent a triple threat not only do importing countries have to pay more for grain they have to pay more to bring it to their countries and still more to deliver it to consumers who may live a long distance from ports
Raising interest rates can reduce aggregate demand which can slow the economy and tame increases in prices of some goods and services especially nontraded goods and services
But unless taken to an intolerable level these measures by themselves cannot bring inflation down to the targeted levels
For example even if global energy and food prices increase at a more moderate rate than now  for example  per year  and get reflected in domestic prices bringing the overall inflation rate to say  would require markedly falling prices elsewhere That would almost surely entail a marked economic slowdown and high unemployment
The cure would be worse than the disease
So what should be done
First politicians or central bankers should not be blamed for imported inflation just as we should not give them credit for low inflation when the global environment is benign
Former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan it is now recognized deserves much blame for America current economic mess
He is also sometimes given credit for America low inflation during his tenure
But the truth is that America in the Greenspan years benefited from a period of declining commodity prices and from deflation in China which helped keep prices of manufactured goods in check
Second we must recognize that high prices can cause enormous stress especially for lowerincome individuals
Riots and protests in some developing countries are just the worst manifestation of this
Advocates of trade liberalization touted its advantages but they were never fully honest about its risks against which markets typically fail to provide adequate insurance
Over a quartercentury ago I showed that under plausible conditions trade liberalization could make everyone worse off
I was not arguing for protectionism but rather sounding a cautionary note that we must be aware of the downside risks and be prepared to deal with them
When it comes to agriculture developed countries such as the US and European Union members insulate both consumers and farmers from these risks
But most developing countries do not have the institutional structures or the resources to do likewise
Many are imposing emergency measures like export taxes or bans which help their own citizens but at the expense of those elsewhere
If we are to avoid an even stronger backlash against globalization the West must respond quickly and strongly
Biofuel subsidies which have encouraged the shift of land from producing food into energy must be repealed
In addition some of the billions spent to subsidize Western farmers should now be spent to help poorer developing countries meet their basic food and energy needs
Most importantly both developing and developed countries need to abandon inflation targeting
The struggle to meet rising food and energy prices is hard enough
The weaker economy and higher unemployment that inflation targeting brings won have much impact on inflation it will only make the task of surviving in these conditions more difficult
The Fairness of Financial Rescue
BERKELEY  Perhaps the best way to view a financial crisis is to look at it as a collapse in the risk tolerance of investors in private financial markets
Maybe the collapse stems from lousy internal controls in financial firms that swaddled by implicit government guarantees lavish their employees with enormous rewards for risky behavior
Or perhaps a long run of good fortune has left the financial market dominated by cockeyed optimists who have finally figured that out
Or perhaps it stems simply from unreasoning panic
Whatever the cause when the risk tolerance of the market crashes so do prices of risky financial assets
Everybody knows that there are immense unrealized losses in financial assets but no one is sure that they know where those losses are
To buy  or even to hold  risky assets in such a situation is a recipe for financial disaster
So is buying or holding equity in firms that may be holding risky assets regardless of how afe a firm stock was previously thought to be
This crash in prices of risky financial assets would not overly concern the rest of us were it not for the havoc that it has wrought on the price system which is sending a peculiar message to the real economy
The price system is saying shut down risky production activities and don undertake any new activities that might be risky
But there aren enough safe secure and sound enterprises to absorb all the workers laid off from risky enterprises
And if the decline in nominal wages signals that there is an excess supply of labor matters only get worse
General deflation eliminates the capital of yet more financial intermediaries and makes risky an even larger share of assets that had previously been regarded as safe
Ever since  central banks standard response in such situations  except during the Great Depression of the   has been the same raise and support the prices of risky financial assets and prevent financial markets from sending a signal to the real economy to shut down risky enterprises and eschew risky investments
This response is understandably controversial because it rewards those who bet on risky assets many of whom accepted risk with open eyes and bear some responsibility for causing the crisis
But an effective rescue cannot be done any other way
A policy that leaves owners of risky financial assets impoverished is a policy that shuts down dynamism in the real economy
The political problem can be finessed as Don Kohn a vicechairman of the Federal Reserve recently observed teaching a few thousand feckless financiers not to overspeculate is much less important than securing the jobs of millions of Americans and tens of millions around the globe
Financial rescue operations that benefit even the unworthy can be accepted if they are seen as benefiting all  even if the unworthy gain more than their share of the benefits
What cannot be accepted are financial rescue operations that benefit the unworthy and cause losses to other important groups  like taxpayers and wage earners
And that unfortunately is the perception held by many nowadays particularly in the United States
It is easy to see why
When Vice Presidential candidate Jack Kemp attacked Vice President Al Gore in  for the Clinton administration decision to bail out Mexico feckless government during the  financial crisis Gore responded that America made  billion on the deal
Similarly Clinton treasury secretary Robert Rubin and IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus were attacked for committing public money to bail out New York banks that had loaned to feckless East Asians in 
They responded that they had not rescued the truly bad speculative actor Russia that they had ailed in not bailed out the New York banks by requiring them to cough up additional money to support South Korea economy and that everyone had benefited massively because a global recession was avoided
Now however the US government can say none of these things
Officials cannot say that a global recession has been avoided that they ailed in the banks that  with the exception of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns  they forced the bad speculative actors into bankruptcy or that the government made money on the deal
It is still true that the bankingsector policies that were undertaken were good  or at least better than doing nothing
But the certainty that matters would have been much worse under a handsoff approach to the financial sector  la Republican Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon in  is not concrete enough to alter public perceptions
What is concrete enough are soaring bankers bonuses and a real economy that continues to shed jobs
The Falklands War Year Dnouement
GENEVA  In April  the United Kingdom faced the imminent use of force by the Argentine junta in the Falkland Islands Malvinas
When Sir Anthony Parsons the UK representative to the United Nations appeared before the Security Council to call for action he did not do so o discuss the rights or wrongs of the very longstanding issue between Great Britain and Argentina over the islands in the South Atlantic
The British were requesting Security Council action for one reason o deter any threat of armed force
Parsons submitted a draft which became Security Council Resolution  demanding the cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of the Argentine forces and calling on both governments o seek a diplomatic solution to their differences
The rest of the story is well known
On June   the Argentine forces surrendered to the British Commander
The hostilities had ended but the dispute over the Falklands sovereignty remained
Soon after the conflict the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution requesting that Argentina and the UK resume negotiations in order to find a peaceful solution to the sovereignty issue as quickly as possible
The British government however refused to talk
Now on the th anniversary of the Falklands War the British government remains steadfast that there will be no sovereignty negotiations with Argentina unless the islanders so request because their right to selfdetermination must be respected
But is the British government stance justifiable
Whether or not the principle of selfdetermination applies to the inhabitants of the Falkland Islands is a major bone of contention between the UK and Argentina
Indeed not just any human community is considered to possess that right
In fact who has it and how to apply fuels controversy around the world
Britain claims find little support in the international community
No UN resolution related to the FalklandsMalvinas has ever referred to selfdetermination  in stark contrast with resolutions concerning decolonization elsewhere
Indeed Britain refusal to make any attempt to settle the sovereignty dispute until  British subjects ask the government to do so flies in the face not only of fundamental rules of international law but also of elementary logic
The British government stance amounts to a breach of its obligation under international law to settle international disputes through available peaceful means
This obligation implies positive action not mere abstention from the use of force
By rejecting Argentine proposals to negotiate refusing to accept the good offices of the UN SecretaryGeneral and failing to propose any alternative means of resolving the dispute the UK is adopting a stance that is not merely unfriendly but illegal
Nor can the UK refusal to negotiate be justified on the grounds that Argentina has inscribed its sovereignty claim into its  constitution
After all London refused to negotiate with Argentina before 
More fundamentally it is to be expected that countries would establish as a matter of domestic law a claim to any disputed territory
The outcome of negotiations would then require either country  or both  to modify its domestic law in order for the compromise to enter into force
Simply put a domestic claim to the disputed territory cannot constitute an obstacle to negotiations
Many countries consider the FalklandsMalvinas to be Argentine territory including all of those in the surrounding region
None of the other permanent members of the Security Council recognizes the UK sovereignty claim
Indeed the overwhelming majority of countries have called on the UK and Argentina to enter into negotiations
Maintaining the status quo is thus more than an obstacle to normal relations between Argentina and the UK two countries that have traditionally maintained strong links it adversely affects British relations with the entire region
Moreover it negatively affects the islands development
The Falkland Islands leaders must understand that ignoring the sovereignty dispute is not an option and that their purported right to selfdetermination is neither endorsed by the UN nor recognized by a majority of countries  even those nearby
A compromise is possible if the concerned parties are willing to take the necessary steps to relieve future generations of the potential hazards of this longstanding dispute
Argentina and the UK have an opportunity to give a positive example showing the rest of the world that even disputes that have led to violence in the past can be solved through imaginative diplomatic formulas
Only by bringing this conflict to an end can those who lost their lives on the Falkland Islands  years ago truly be honored
The Fall of France
French influence in Europe is declining and President Jacques Chirac is largely to blame
He made the right choice before the Iraq war  Americas intervention was never justified and has yielded a terrible failure  and so found himself in sync with an emerging European even global opposition to the Bush administration
But he has failed to transform his position into one of ongoing leadership
Chiracs stature and experience should have allowed him to rally all of Europe before during or after the crisis
But he never sought such a role
Faced with American unilateralism he failed to promote realistic multilateral solutions
On the contrary despite being right about Iraq Chirac became isolated an isolation that grew because he also failed to reestablish satisfactory relations with President Bush
Indeed under Chirac France appears increasingly arrogant a nation convinced of the righteousness of its views and the universality of its model  the very charges so often levelled against George W Bushs America
Chirac compounded his errors over Iraq in his approach to the new European Commission
On the old commission headed by Romano Prodi France was powerfully represented with Pascal Lamy holding the trade portfolio
Lamy is widely acknowledged for his skill his intellect and his strong personality
Maintaining Frances weight within the European Union should have led Chirac to reconfirm Lamy when Jos Manuel Barroso took over as President of the Commission
But in Chiracs eyes Lamy possessed two fatal flaws he is a socialist and he favors reform of the Common Agricultural Policy
Chirac Georges Pompidous agriculture minister in the s wants to keep the CAP as it is
So Chirac replaced Lamy with Jacques Barrot an honorable and experienced politician but one with little knowledge of EU affairs and no language other than French
No surprise then that Barrot was given a minor role on a new European Commission that is liberal and Atlanticist quite out of sync with French positions
Barrot received the transportation portfolio a minor post far below the type of position  competition or domestic affairs  that Chirac demanded
True Barroso offered Barrot the symbolic title of Commission VicePresident but this is a mere consolation prize that doesnt fool anyone
Chiracs very character works against French influence in Europe
He seems to belong to an era when France considered Europe a French formal garden
He is nostalgic for the s and the Gaullist ideology that shaped both France and himself
These biases matter because they do not jibe with the enlarged Europe of today
France was a core part of Europe when the Union had only six members and reflected the primary goal of FrancoGerman reconciliation
The fall of the Berlin Wall changed all that
Of course the French vision still plays a major part in todays Europe of  members our exceptionality  be it cultural or political  remains important even if it is less well regarded
But French ideas are not necessarily central to a Europe no longer driven by the FrancoGerman engine
Given this change in European dynamics France should have looked for new ways to assert influence
Instead Chirac demeaned and sometimes humiliated his European partners gradually rallying everyone against him
No one should be surprised that so contemptuous a French attitude one utterly disdainful of the Unions Solidarity Pact and competition regulations provoked a reaction detrimental to France
That contempt is also manifested in Frances nominees to serve on the Commission
Unlike for example Great Britain France rarely nominates young and talented persons capable of shaping the EUs future
Of course this decline must not be overestimated
France remains a major European country it is a founder of the Union one of the worlds richest nations and holds a permanent seat on the UN Security Council
It defends with its nuclear power an autonomous and important foreign and defense policy
France represents values a culture and a history that grant it a durable global audience
It matters and will continue to matter in the European Council and the European Parliament
Moreover France needs to avoid the temptation to overcompensate for the diminishing role of the FrancoGerman tandem which may no longer be sufficient to power the Union but nonetheless remains necessary
In this respect the composition of the Barroso Commission worries me the role given to my friend the German Social Democrat Gnter Verheugen is no more enviable than that given to Barrot
A Commission that keeps France and Germany at bay and entrusts its major posts to representatives of small countries to more liberal actors and partisans of the American intervention in Iraq will not be successful
This is why I cannot trust such a Commission
France will also have to reform its European strategy if it is to regain influence
I wish France could adopt a more humble attitude show more respect for its partners and the EUs institutions and view Europe as more than an extension of its own philosophy
Here I have no confidence in Jacques Chirac
Thankfully his reign wont last forever
The decline of French influence in Europe is undeniable but it is neither fatal nor desirable
It must be stopped
But this wont be achieved by invoking past glory
For the rising generation of French political leaders the essential task is to spur France to lead a reunited Europe by working within it
The Fall of the House of Murdoch
NEW YORK  During the four decades since the Watergate affair engulfed US President Richard Nixon politicians have repeatedly ignored the scandal main lesson the coverup is worse than the crime
Like Nixon they have paid a higher price for concealing their misdeeds than they would have for the misdeeds alone
Now for once comes a scandal that breaks that rule the United Kingdom phonehacking affair which has shaken British politics to its foundations
Over the past decade the tabloid newspaper The News of the World owned by Rupert Murdoch News Corporation targeted  people voicemail
The list includes not only royalty celebrities and other VIPs but also the families of servicemen killed in Afghanistan and Iraq and those of victims of the July  terrorist attack in London
It all unraveled when The Guardian reported that the tabloid had hacked into the voicemail of missing yearold Milly Dowler apparently in the hope of obtaining some private expressions of family members grief or desperation that it could splash on its front page
When the girl murdered body was found six months later the family and the police thought she might still be alive because The News of the World operatives were deleting messages when her phone mailbox became full
According to Scotland Yard Murdoch hacks reportedly bribed midlevel police officers to supply information as well
In the extensive annals of eavesdropping all of this is something new
Not even Stalin wiretapped the dead
A coverup ensued
James Murdoch Rupert son and Chairman and Chief Executive of News Corporation European and Asian operations authorized a secret payment of  million  million to buy the silence of hacking victims
Millions of inhouse emails reportedly have been destroyed
Still it seems safe to say that the peculiarly repellant inhumanity of the original deeds will remain more shocking than the details of this or any other coverup
Even so the political consequences of the phonehacking scandal will depend on far more than the outcome of the official investigations now underway in Britain
Above all the scandal impact will depend on how governments and citizens assess what News Corporation really is
The Murdochs call News Corporation a journalistic enterprise
In fact it is first an entertainment company with the bulk of its revenue coming from its film and television holdings
Second and more importantly it is a propaganda machine for rightwing causes and political figures
This is News Corporation main face in the US in the form of Fox News whose hallmark has been relentless propagation of rightwing ideology
Whereas political propaganda had once been the domain of governments and political parties Fox News is formally independent of both  though itoverwhelmingly serves the interests of America Republican Party
In Britain News Corporation has been creating a sort of state unto itself by corrupting the police assuming police powers of surveillance and intimidating politicians into looking the other way
In the US it has behaved similarly using corporate media power to breathe life into a standalone political organization the Tea Party
All of this is far removed from what a journalistic organization is supposed to do
Journalism essential role in a democracy is to enable people to fulfill their roles as citizens by providing information about government other powerful institutions civil movements international events and so on
But News Corporation replaces such journalism with titillation and gossip as it did when it took over the yearold News of the World and turned it into a tabloid in  and with partisan campaigns as it did when it created Fox News in 
Not surprisingly at Fox News as at many other News Corporation outlets editorial independence is sacrificed to ironfisted centralized control
News and commentary are mingled in an uninterrupted stream of political campaigning
Ideology trumps factuality
And major Republican figures including possible contenders for the party presidential nomination are hired as ommentators
Indeed its specific genius has been to turn propaganda into a popular and financial success
Given The News of the World profitability no one should be surprised if the Murdochs have been replicating their sunken British flagship reprehensible behavior elsewhere
But whatever else is revealed the UK phonehacking scandal is of a piece with the Murdochs transformation of news into propaganda both reflect an assault on democracy essential walls of separation between media the state and political parties
The Murdochs are fusing these entities into a single unaccountable power that as we see in Britain today lacks any restraint or scruple
That effort should compel us to confront an uncomfortable reality underlying both the British phonehacking scandal with its penumbra of appalling cruelty and wanton corruption and Fox News America most popular news channel too many people want what the News Corporation has been offering
And what too many people want can be dangerous to a civilized lawbased society
To glimpse just how dangerous consider Italy where Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi MediaSet conglomerate has seduced broad swathes of the electorate since the  with a Murdochlike combination of insipid variety shows and partisan political theater
When Italy postwar party system collapsed in the early  Berlusconi was able to establish his own political party win power and over the course of three governments bend laws and government institutions to serve his business and personal interests
The News Corporation seems determined to take Britain and the US down a similar path
But now at least in Britain the political class is in revolt
Prime Minister David Cameron  who previously cultivated close ties with News Corporation leaders even employing as his press secretary The News of the World former editor who was recently arrested for his role in the scandal  called the phone hacking isgusting
Meanwhile Labour leaders who had also sought the Murdochs favor have vowed to block News Corporation bid for full ownership of Britain largest paytelevision broadcaster
Whether the rebellion will jump across the Atlantic remains to be seen
The Fall of the Hyper Power
Listen carefully these days to Israelis and South Koreans
What they are hinting at is no less than a tectonic shift in the international system the shift from a unipolar to a multipolar world
Israelis are rediscovering Europe
They intuitively sense that they can no longer rely only on the absolute security guarantee represented by the United States combination of active and passive support
The war in Lebanon so frustrating for Israel accelerated that subtle change
Now Europe and its various contingents are playing a leading role in picking up the pieces there
America of course remains Israel life insurance policy but enlargement and diversification of diplomatic alliances is starting to be seen as crucial by Israeli diplomats if not by Israeli society
The Quartet the US Russia the European Union and the United Nations used to be regarded as ne plus Three but that is no longer the case
Europe and Russia no longer see themselves as secondary players because the US not to mention Israel needs them
As for the South Koreans they are counting on China to deal with the North Korean nuclear crisis
They too see the world through a prism that makes America continue to appear essential but no longer preeminent
Recently a high South Korean official listed in hierarchical order the countries that mattered most in the North Korean nuclear crisis
China came first followed by the US Russia Japan and South Korea whereas Europe was absent
These are only a few signs among many others
One could also mention the recent SinoAfrican summit in Beijing or the intensification of VenezuelanIranian relations
All these developments subtly indicate a deep trend that can be formalized in one sentence America unipolar moment which began in  with the collapse of the Soviet Empire is over
Of course one should not ury the US too soon
America is much more resilient than its critics believe
It has a unique capacity to rebound and it controls unparalleled military intellectual economic and even political resources
The Republicans defeat in this month midterm Congressional elections is a sign that Americans want to sanction their leaders for their strategic and ethical shortcomings and they did so with gusto
But this resilience should not hide a deeper evolution
The US is no longer alone
America no longer qualifies if it ever did as a yper power to use former French foreign minister Hubert Vedrine term though it is still far from being a ormal power
America inadvertent assivity in the Clinton years and the wrong directions of the Bush years coincided with the rise of China and India as well as Russia renewed international clout as a result of high oil prices
These developments ushered in the slow imperfect return of an unbalanced multipolar system
The world in which we live may be moving toward the multipolarity wished for by French President Jacques Chirac but not necessarily in a successful and stable way
If contrary to the traditional aullist vision multipolarity is not bringing stability but instead generating chaos there are two reasons for this outcome
First key emerging actors  China Russia and India  are not ready willing or even capable of performing a stabilizing international role
They are either too cynical or timid in their vision of the world or they have others priorities or both
They probably contemplate with barely disguised pleasure the difficulties currently encountered by the US in Iraq and elsewhere but they do not feel any sense of a ompensating responsibility for global stability
The common good is not their cup of tea
They have too much to catch up with in terms of national ego and national interest to care for others
Second the EU is the only natural American ally in terms of values
It is the EU that can make multipolarity work if it plays its role positively
If the EU appears more concerned with the best ways to avoid the responsibilities that may befall it as a result of America new and enforced modesty then multipolarity will result  by default not by design  in a more chaotic world rather than leading to greater stability
Europe has a unique chance to demonstrate that it can make a difference in America postunipolar moment
It starts right now in the MiddleEast
The world that Europe has called for is coming closer and it can fail abysmally without the EU or improve at the margin thanks to it
In some ways the end of a unipolar world could truly be the our of Europe
But that can happen only if the EU regains its confidence and steps into a positive role  one that it must play with not against the US
The Rupee WakeUp Call
PRINCETON  The Indian rupee has weakened rapidly in recent months with the exchange rate against the US dollar dropping by  to around  rupees since early May
As a symbol of India economic strength the rupee fall has provoked more than the usual handwringing and angst at home and abroad
There is indeed reason to be worried but not because the rupee value has declined
In fact the slide has been long in coming and recent market uncertainty has merely been a wakeup call
The real reason to worry is that India has lost international competitiveness and has been buying time by borrowing from fickle lenders
Growth momentum has fizzled and with inflation persistently high Indian producers are struggling to compete in world markets
The currentaccount deficit is increasing relentlessly owing to a widening trade deficit now at  of GDP raising the danger of a balanceofpayments crisis
Indian GDP grew at heady rates of  per year between  and  a period that seemed to herald a decisive break from the anemic indu rate of growth
Reforms had unleashed new entrepreneurial energies and the prospect of a brighter future lifted people aspirations
With foreign manufacturers piling in to satisfy a new hunger for consumer durables India turned its gaze outward
The global economy  in a phase of buoyant expansion  welcomed India information technology services
Bangalore the informationtechnology hub Bollywood and yoga became symbols of India soft power
That was the moment to invest in the future
But the opportunity was wasted
Infrastructure did not keep pace with the economy needs
And more deplorably educational standards lagged
For a country positioning itself as a leader in the global knowledge economy neglecting investment in education was a grave error with other countries now staking a claim to the role to which India aspired
And even when times were good India never gained a foothold in the global manufacturedgoods trade
Today domestic investment has plummeted exports are languishing and GDP growth is down to around  per year
Moreover India has developed a tendency for chronic inflation owing to an unhappy combination of supply bottlenecks caused by poor infrastructure and excessive demand thanks to persistent public deficits
Budget deficits offered what appeared to be a free lunch as the resulting inflation eroded the real value of public debt while the government had privileged access to private savings at nearzero real interest rates
With so much largesse to spread around the government became a source of contracts with annuitylike earnings which offered robust returns for those with political access
That weakened the incentives for entrepreneurship
And as India external position deteriorated the rupee became significantly overvalued between early  and late  trading in a narrow range while domestic inflation galloped ahead in a global environment of relative price stability
Amid weakening competitiveness the rupee was propped up by increasingly unstable foreign sources of funds
Traditionally nearly half of India trade deficit has been financed by remittances from Indian expatriates
Part of this flow is steady because it supports families at home but much of it is opportunistic investment seeking real returns
According to recent data remittances have slowed or even fallen slightly
Similarly longterm foreign investors have had reason to pause
This is not surprising given the slowdown in consumption growth car sales for example are suffering a prolonged decline
India has been left to finance its external deficit increasingly through shortterm borrowing the most capricious form of international capital
As Rudi Dornbusch the late MIT economics professor once warned a crisis takes longer than expected to arrive but moves faster than anticipated when it does
India may be particularly vulnerable because all players there have been complicit in a silent conspiracy of denial
An overvalued exchange rate strengthens repayment capacity so international bankers cheer it on  until they cut and run
And the Indian government played a large part in fueling rupee appreciation by easing companies ability to borrow abroad
Indeed at a time when restricting access to shortterm international funds has acquired intellectual respectability the government reluctance to enforce curbs has been puzzling
The International Monetary Fund which now supports selective imposition of capital controls seems unconcerned the rupee its annual review concludes is fairly valued
This benign assessment is consistent with the IMF record of overlooking gathering crises
With an overvalued rupee there are no good policy choices
To avert a disorderly fall shortterm macroeconomic management requires officially engineered depreciation through administrative methods and restraints on external borrowing
A depreciated rupee should help revive Indian exports and lift growth
But in the absence of complementary action depreciation  whether engineered or marketdriven  will make matters worse
To dampen the additional inflationary pressures implied by a weaker rupee more aggressive fiscal retrenchment is needed
Even so a depreciated rupee will increase the burden of repaying foreign debt and deepen the woes of domestic companies and banks
To reclaim its promise India must foster a new generation of productivity growth
The time for action is now
Unfortunately a serious crisis may be required to initiate that response
The Fall of the Language Curtain
Ten years ago the body of Imre Nagy the political leader of the failed Hungarian revolution of  was exhumed from a secret grave for a public and honorable reburial
A huge gathering in Budapests Heroes Square marked that moment listening to a then unknown student leader Viktor Orban call for the Red Army to leave Hungary and for democracy to be established
Today Viktor Orban is Hungarys Prime Minister
BUDAPEST In linguistics we know that some verbs have a function called the performative function
By uttering the verb we actually perform an act we christen a ship we pronounce a couple man and wife
In other former Communist countries democratic changes were sometimes accompanied by violence
Changes in Hungary were brought about solely by the power of words
Words proved revolutionary
Language delivered a fundamental breakthrough in the life of nations
Speeches delivered ten years ago at the reburial of former Prime Minister Imre Nagy executed in  by Communist collaborators of the Soviet occupying army contributed to that process
Words demanding that Russian troops leave Hungarian territory culminated in the collapse of the communist regime
How effective words can be particularly if two hundred thousand people gather in a square to hear them
Under Communism the language used in politics and public life even literature was like a secret code
Although everyone was more or less aware of the implications of terms used by politicians and journalists there was an immense gap between that language and the one used by people in their hushed personal conversations
In  the first manifestation of a nascent democracy was the gush of free speech triggered by decades of coerced silence
Freedom of speech and linguistic liberation were the stepping stones to democracy
People were glued to television savouring the new politicians who openly spoke a language hitherto suppressed
The speech that I gave on  June  at Imre Nagys reburial exposed everyones silent desire for free elections and an independent and democratic Hungary
Principle permits no ambiguity and no gradations
After the speech I was reproached for my demand that Soviet troops leave our country
Yet the members of my party Fidesz were convinced that our claim for a free Hungary was legitimate and we were proven right by History
A moments insight is sometimes worth a lifes experience Oliver Wendel Holmes once said and we recognised that the timing was right
Mikhail Gorbachev had opened his own Pandoras box
Once opened there was no way for the truth to be shoved back
What one generation sees as luxury another sees as necessity
Independence was indispensable for the other objectives we set out to achieve
To an entire generation democracy human rights a market economy were conceived as luxuries
Now we cannot imagine our lives without them
They are the fundamental basis of Hungarian life
Ten years ago as it became clear to the peoples in countries formerly behind the Iron Curtain that Communism no longer existed we knew that we had to establish democracy
But what does it mean to establish democracy
Well what it meant was to build a state a democratic state
Over the past ten years we have built new states replacing the cloned Communist monoliths that operated for over forty years
We established democratic institutions replaced fiveyearplans with markets privatised most state assets
Over  of Hungarys GDP is now produced by the private sector  of Hungarys trade is conducted with European Union members
In Hungary as well as in a few other countries of Central Europe postCommunism is practically over
But Communisms fall made us recognize that it had debased not only
individual freedom but the sense of community as well
So our task was not only to reconstruct the state but society too  its family values its national traditions and cultural heritage
Our newly freed societies must now learn the languages of our constituent parts just as we learned a new economic and political language
Through learning each others languages through cooperation based on shared values common interests as well as historical ties Central Europe has demonstrated what spectacular results can be achieved
The Visegrd Group CEFTA the Central European Initiative have produced a thriving free trade system and an increasing flow of investment between countries in the region
In a broader context Hungarys reintegration into western institutional structures is proceeding steadily if not at the desired pace
With NATO membership for Poland the Czech Republic and Hungary the Yalta world order came to an end
This not only surpassed what ten years ago on Heroes Square sounded like chutzpah it also delivered historical justice to the Hungarian freedomfighters of  who had fought for Hungarys independence but were crushed by Soviet tanks
The tragic conflict in Kosovo that erupted only days after Hungary joined NATO confirmed our conviction that our security could be guaranteed only within NATOs structure
Hungary will celebrate the th anniversary of its statehood next year so we hardly need practice in the dialect of European civilisation
However we do have to learn the details of European Union jargon
This let us face it sometimes seems a tonguetwister
Accession talks began last November and the EUs Berlin summit cleared the way for enlargement
But a clear date for accession must be indicated and not lost in some fog of words
At the third democratic general elections in  Hungarians voted for a radical break with the past
They voted into power a generation whose members are untarnished by the bargains of the past
Hungary is the first country in Central Europe where such a generational change has taken place
This new government brought along a new style which avoids the obscure bureaucratic mumbojumbo used by those previously in power
Our goal has been to put across understandable messages in comprehensible terms
We share Wittgensteins point that everything that can be said can be said clearly
Some may think it is dangerous to form a government headed by someone still in his thirties
But the past ten years in Hungary was not like an average decade in an established democracy
During these years Parliament framed the countrys democratic operation making up for what had been eliminated during forty years of dictatorship
We legislated in what sometimes seemed a forced march
No one had a precise idea about how to proceed from a Communist structure to democracy
While others talked about transition we implemented the measures it required
Progress is impossible without change
We live at a moment in history where change is so speeded up that see the present only when it is already disappearing
Bearing this in mind we must take care in planning our future
Success is not a doorway its a staircase
In Hungary we have learned that in order to accomplish our goals we must complete the performative function of the verb
Let me invoke the words of Emily Dickenson A word is dead when it is said some say
I say it just begins to live that day
The Fall of the UN
Saddam Husseins reign of terror is about to end
His Baathist government however will not go alone
In a fitting irony the United Nations is going down with him
Perhaps the entire UN will not disappear
Those parts devoted to good works ie the lowrisk peacekeeping bureaucracies or those that fight AIDs and malaria or protect children will remain
The looming chatterbox on New Yorks East River will also continue to bleat
What died with the Security Councils unwillingness to sanction force to implement its own resolutions on Iraqs possession of weapons of mass destruction was the decadesold fantasy of the UN as the bedrock of world order
As we sift the debris of the war to liberate Iraq it will be important to preservethe better to understandthe intellectual wreckage of the liberal conceit of security through international law administered by international institutions
As free Iraqis document the quartercentury nightmare of Saddams rule we must not forget who supported this war and who did not who held that the international communitys moral authority was enshrined in pleas for more time for the UN arms inspectors and who marched against regime change
In the spirit of postwar reconciliation that diplomats are always keen to engender we must not reconcile ourselves to the timid blighted notion that world order requires us to recoil before rogue states that terrorize their citizens and menace our own
Decent thoughtful highminded the millions who marched against holding Iraq to account were catalyzed by the idea that only the UN Security Council has the authority to legitimize the resort to force
A voluntary coalition of liberal democracies willing to put their own soldiers in harms way isnt good enough
It does not seem to matter that such troops are being used to enforce the UNs own demands
If a country or coalition of countries other than the UN Security Council uses force even as a last resort anarchy not international law would prevail destroying all hope of world order
Or so the protestors believed
But this is a dangerously wrong idea an idea that leads inexorably to handing great moral and even existential politicomilitary decisions to the likes of Syria Cameroon Angola Russia China and France
If a policy is right when the Security Council approves how can it be wrong just because communist China or Russia or France or a gaggle of minor dictatorships withhold approbation
Those who opposed the actions of the coalition in Iraq usually fall back on the answer that order must have primacy over anarchy
But is this right
Is the UN Security Council the institution most capable of ensuring order and saving us from anarchy
History suggests not
The UN arose from the ashes of a war that the League of Nations was unable to avert
The League was simply not up to confronting Italy in Abyssinia much less had it survived that debacle taking on Nazi Germany
In the euphoric aftermath of the victory in World War Two the hope that security could be made collective was reposed in the UN Security Councilwith abject results
During the Cold War the Security Council was hopelessly paralyzed
Indeed the decision to defend South Korea from attack in  was taken by the Council only because Stalin ordered his diplomats to boycott UN proceedings which meant that no Soviet ambassador was around to cast a veto
It was a mistake the Soviets would not make again
In both  and  with war looming the UN withdrew from the Middle East leaving Israel to defend itself
The Soviet empire was wrestled to the ground and Eastern Europe liberated not by the UN but by the mother of all coalitions NATO
Facing Milosevics multiple aggressions the UN could not stop the Balkan wars or even protect its victims
Remember Sarajevo
Remember Srebrenica and the slaughter of thousands of Muslims under the supposed protection of the UN
It took a coalition of the willing to save Bosnia from extinction
When the war was over peace was made in Dayton Ohio not at the UN
The rescue of Kosovos Muslims was not a UN action their cause never gained Security Council approval
This century now challenges the hopes for a new world order in new ways
We will not defeat or even contain fanatical terror unless we can carry the war to the territories from which it is launched
This will sometimes require that we use force against states that harbor terrorists as we did in destroying the Taliban regime in Afghanistan
The most dangerous of these states are those that possess weapons of mass destruction the chemical biological and nuclear weapons that can kill not hundreds or thousands but hundreds of thousands
Iraq was such a state but there are others
Whatever hope exists that they can be persuaded to withdraw support or sanctuary from terrorists rests on the certainty and effectiveness with which they are confronted
The chronic failure of the Security Council to enforce its own resolutions with respect to Iraq is unmistakable it is simply not up to the task
So we are left with coalitions of the willing
Far from disparaging them as a threat to a new world order we should recognize that they are by default the best hope for that order and the true alternative to the anarchy caused by the dismal failure of the United Nations
The Fall of the Wall Revisited
BERLIN I learned that the Berlin Wall was falling during an official visit to Poland ten years ago
On the evening of November th Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki invited my delegation to a banquet in the former palace of Prince Radziwill
Before arriving at dinner the Secretary of the Chancellery Rudolf Seiters called from Bonn
He told me that the district chairman of communist East Berlin had suddenly announced temporary regulations permitting travel by private citizens
Permits to visit the West were to be granted to all applicants even on short notice
With that simple decision I knew that German history would soon change for easier travel meant that the Wall was passable for everyone
Still at first I did not foresee those spectacular and joyous night time celebrations that were about to take place in Berlin
Throughout my career I never doubted that Germany would one day regain its unity some time in the future
But I never dared to dream that reunion of east and west would happen during my term as Chancellor
Only with Mikhail Gorbachev and his policies of perestroika and glasnost did reunification become a real possibility
Without Gorbachev and his singular courage the stream of events across Europe during fall of  never would have been possible
For with Gorbachevs ascendance more and more people in East Germany took heart and stopped being afraid of their repressive regime
They realized that the realities of East Germany were not fixed in stone after all that it was possible to achieve change which many brave dissidents and proponents of civil rights trapped behind the wall had demanded for so long a time
Their commitment against the injustice of the communist regime is for me one of the best chapters in German history
The opening of Hungarys borders that autumn and the seeking of refuge by East German citizens in the German embassies of Prague and Warsaw already had shaken communist and Stasi rule to its their foundations
But on the night of November th when the wall and the barbed wire which had failed to irrevocably divide Germans over many decades of bitter separation began to crumble communisms collapse became irreversible
We had entered a new era
From that day the wheel of history spun faster
When I returned from the banquet to watch the news from Berlin on television I decided to cut short my visit to Warsaw
It was not easy to persuade my hosts that at such an historic moment the place of the German Chancellor could only be in our old capital among the celebrating crowds 
My instincts to return home were also aroused by the scenes that unravelled the next night November th during a rally in front of Berlins Town Hall
A mob of extreme leftists succeeded in drowning out the German hymn sung by people celebrating the Walls approaching collapse
I was determined to show that the extremists were not representative of Berliners
On the contrary most people simply felt like expressing feelings of utter joy
They yearned for unity justice and freedom for their homeland
So I flew to Berlin but before I addressed the crowds from the balustrade of Schoenebergs Town Hall I received a call from Mikhail Gorbachev
The Soviet leader asked me to control public enthusiasm in order to prevent chaos and bloodshed
He had received reports that the situation was growing out of control
He wanted to know whether it was true that angry mobs were storming Soviet army facilities
One of my staff conveyed my answer to Gorbachev
I assured him that his information was wrong
He believed me
It helped that we had gotten to know each other on a human level and to trust each other during his visit to Germany in June 
In spite of differences concerning for example the German question peace was for both of us not just a word but an existential and basic necessity
Later Gorbachev told me that he had been intentionally misinformed by opponents of reform who wanted Soviet troops in East Germany to intervene
To this day I remain thankful to Gorbachev for not listening to agitators but to my arguments
When faced with the choice of leaving the tanks in their barracks or calling them out onto the streets he opted for a peace and later accepted the new reality that people in East Germany had created with so much courage
For his foresight and bravery one cannot give him too much credit
After November th the process gained more and more momentum
In an unbelievably short period of only eleven months German unity became a reality
For me it was a dreamcometrue
Yet I felt two strong obligations for the future
One commitment can be loosely described by the image of German and European unity as constituting two sides of the same coin
One could not exist without the other
I expressed the other obligation by talking about the necessity of creating blooming landscapes in the new eastern states of Germany
Both were extraordinarily large and demanding tasks
In the ten years since the fall of the wall I believe that both goals although not in their entirety have been reached in their essence
Unified Germany has a strong commitment to both Europe and the Transatlantic Alliance
With regard to the new German states both the transition toward democracy and a free society and the structural changes made to the former communist economy have been successful though these tasks will undoubtedly require the energy and labors of several generations before they are completely fulfilled
Most importantly Germans regard themselves today as one people once again
With the help of sound policies we are poised as a modern society to win the future
The Fallen Heroes of the Financial Crisis
PARIS  Oscar Wilde said that experience is the name we give to our mistakes
Last year we tried to analyze the errors that led the world into economic crisis
Now it is time to analyze the mistakes we made when trying to get out of it
When the scale of the crisis became clear last year many were certain that it would be managed badly
But perhaps we should be grateful that it was managed at all
Unlike in the  decisionmakers acted quickly ignoring dogmas that warned against rapid intervention
Moreover they knew that in contrast to the interwar period close international coordination would be needed
In  the influence of the G grew at the expense of the G
People became aware of the need for truly global governance
And at long last a number of proposals emerged aimed at making such governance a reality
Experience it turns out is not just the name we give to our mistakes
As the financial crisis has shown it is also the process that enables us to increase our understanding and ultimately to envisage a new world
Unfortunately however this process has not gone far enough enabling many banks governments and international institutions to return to usiness as usual
Indeed today the global economy arsonists have become prosecutors and accuse the fire fighters of having provoked flooding
At the peak of the crisis governments had an opportunity to create a new global financial infrastructure
But they let it slip through their fingers
The fact that many Western economies got out of recession last year should not fool us into thinking that the crisis was only a brief interlude and that the postcrisis world can return to the precrisis status quo
There is pressure to rewrite the history of this crisis by depicting effects as if they were causes and to blame the governments that managed the crisis for starting it
A low point  perhaps one should say the height of ridiculousness  was reached last year when rating agencies intensified their surveillance of government debt and markets that had been victimized by the agencies incompetence and bad faith became fixated on their evaluations
Lehman Brothers had been awarded a high rating on the very eve of its collapse yet now the rating agencies criticize governments that pulled the global economy back from the abyss for violating accounting principles
Are rating agencies and the markets really so illinformed about public spending
According to the International Monetary Fund G countries earmarked  of their GDP on average to supporting their banking systems although they spent much less
Likewise spending to stimulate the real economy totaled only  of GDP in   in  and probably  this year
In total the recovery plans of European Union members came to only  of GDP compared with  in the US
Governments took the right measures to save the banks but ignored the political consequences
By doling out vast sums of money to rescue the financial system without asking for genuine guarantees in return they showed a lack of foresight
Acknowledging that rating agencies were incompetent without doing anything to regulate them was inexcusable
As a result taxpayers may need to pay twice once for the bailout and again for the lowquality debt they have incurred during the bailout as the austerity programs unveiled in Europe attest
Paradoxically the growing sense that a catastrophe has been averted has given rise to a growing demand for governments to cut public and social spending and to refrain from proposing investment programs
People are racing back to the policies that caused the crisis in the first place
But governments are not guilty of deceiving the public if anything they acted navely and are now paying the price
Governments really have no choice they must take responsibility and exercise power even if it requires swimming against the tide of public opinion  and especially if it can help alleviate the social suffering brought on by the crisis
Indeed we should remember that economic growth was sustainable only in countries with highly developed social welfare systems like France
Yes these countries will recover at a slower pace than elsewhere but countries that have fallen into a deep hole must work harder than those that have fallen into a shallow one
Perhaps most importantly the drive for greater competitiveness regardless of the cost will only aggravate the crisis
After all exportled growth policies can succeed only if other countries are willing to run deficits
Given that the global imbalances that led to the crisis remain unaddressed increased competitiveness will be a Pyrrhic victory  and one that will exact a severe toll on domestic living standards and consumption
The Fallen Pharaoh
Egypt Kifaya Movement has raised the ante in its opposition to President Hosni Mubarak regime by issuing a massive report that dares to name names and detail corruption among the country leaders
Nothing in Egypt long history has ever equaled this airing of the country dirtiest laundry
Kifaya action is especially bold in the midst of a government crackdown to prepare the way for the succession of Mubarak son Gamal
For example a recent law mandates punishment for anyone who spreads rumors that Gamal is to be the next president
Corruption in Egypt as in other Arab states is so extensive as to undermine the possibility of economic advancement higher living standards a free media independent courts and democracy
Egypt political elite fearful of critical media coverage defeat in fair elections and even imprisonment prefer the existing regime and oppose any significant reform
This is a key theme of the report entitled Corruption in Egypt A Black Cloud That Never Passes
As long as the system is corrupted from above and as long as the only way common people can deal with the government is through bribery says the report inefficiency will reign and people will cheat each other
The only way to break this vicious circle is to replace the regime
At the same time as was seen in Yasir Arafat Palestine Authority a corrupt regime encourages people to turn to radical Islamists who work hard to present themselves as honest
If the Muslim Brotherhood comes to power in Egypt one day Kifaya report will explain a lot about how it happened
The report begins by joking that Egypt name should be changed to asadistan the land of corruption
It documents cases relating to housing business health transportation trade banks drugs agriculture politics culture and the media
One chapter covers how the security forces control appointments to all key jobs including in schools and universities
But the most dramatic part of the book concerns Mubarak himself
An anecdote in the report which rings true has Mubarak meeting with officers of the Third Army two years ago
Some of the younger officers complained about corruption
Mubarak apparently surprised them by saying that he knew that many leading people in the country were thieves but that he believed they had stolen enough to keep them happy
He was afraid he explained that if he appointed new people they would start over in their depredations putting a much heavier burden on Egypt
According to the report however Mubarak his wife Susan and his two sons Gamal and Alaa are far from being mere bystanders
When Mubarak became president in  parliament granted him the right to control all military contracts without legislative oversight
In effect the report states he has a monopoly on military spending and imports apparently a rich source of kickbacks each time he approves a deal
Similarly Susan Mubarak is the head of as many as  charities that often exist only on paper
The report charges that as much as  million might go to one of these institutions in a year but that a large portion is then siphoned off to her secret foreign bank accounts
Ironically Susan Mubarak says the report urged the passage of a  law that permitted Egyptian nongovernmental organizations to receive foreign funds  a provision used by some opposition groups  in order to provide channels for the NGO she runs
The president son Gamal also has his own charities that provide him with money claims Kifaya including the famous alMustaqbal organization
Mubarak two sons are said by the report to receive profitmaking partnerships  without making any investment  in a large number of companies including Phillip Morris Skoda Auto Movenpick Vodafone McDonalds and many others
They can also it adds obtain unsecured bank loans for themselves and their friends
The report maintains that these funds are often used to participate in illegal financial transactions arms dealing and money laundering
The sons interests allegedly also include forays into drug smuggling and illegal exports of archaeological treasures  Egypt cultural heritage  in partnership with Culture Minister Faruq Husni who is supposed to safeguard them
Anyone who stands in their way according to the report can be thrown into prison on false charges of drug dealing
Other cabinet ministers are no better Kifaya claims
Boutros Ghali nephew of the former UN SecretaryGeneral Interior Minister Habib Aladli and such powerful figures as Ibrahim Suleiman and Safwat Sharif are engaged in similar deals sometimes in partnership with Mubarak sons
In short the report says officials can do what they like unbound by law or transparency
By using the mergency law which has restricted freedom since  together with censorship and rigged elections Egypt government treats its citizens like serfs
Meanwhile massive corruption is devastating Egypt economy with growth falling by half in the last two years accompanied by rising unemployment higher inflation and currency depreciation
Foreign investment is also declining and local production is paralyzed necessitating expensive imports
The discontent fueled by these failures is a major potential cause of unrest
By issuing such a detailed report and daring to name Mubarak and his family as the prime culprits Kifaya is challenging the regime headon
The need for reform it argues is not based merely on a desire for better government or abstract rights but is necessary to save a country that is being strangled
The regime may respond by trying to tighten the noose
The Falling Dollar
CAMBRIDGE  When the euro value reached an alltime high of  JeanClaude Trichet the president of the European Central Bank told the press that he was concerned about its rapid appreciation and wanted to nderline the United States Treasury official policy of supporting a strong dollar
Several European finance ministers subsequently echoed a similar theme
In reality of course the US does not have a dollar policy  other than letting the market determine its value
The US government does not intervene in the foreign exchange market to support the dollar and the Federal Reserve monetary policy certainly is not directed toward such a goal
Nor is the Fed specifically aiming to lower the dollar value
Although cutting the Federal Funds interest rate from  in the summer of  to  now contributes to dollar depreciation this has been aimed at stimulating a weakening economy
Nevertheless all US Treasury secretaries going back at least to Robert Rubin in the Clinton administration have repeated the mantra that  strong dollar is good for America whenever they were asked about the dollar value
But while this seems more responsive than o comment it says little about the course of current and future US government action
Indeed the Treasury only explicit currency goal now is to press the Chinese to raise the value of the renminbi thereby reducing the dollar global tradeweighted average
The pressure on China is however entirely consistent with the broader US policy of encouraging countries to allow the financial market to determine their currencies exchange rate
There is of course truth to the statement that a strong dollar benefits the American public since it allows Americans to buy foreign products at a lower cost in dollars
But while the declining dollar does reduce Americans purchasing power the magnitude of this effect is not large because imports account for only about  of US gross domestic product
A  dollar depreciation would therefore reduce Americans purchasing power by only 
At the same time the lower dollar makes American products more competitive in global markets leading to increased exports and reduced imports
The dollar has declined during the past two years against not only the euro but also against most other currencies including the Japanese yen and the renminbi
On a real tradeweighted basis the dollar is down about  relative to its value in March 
This improved competitiveness of American goods and services is needed to shrink the massive US trade deficit
Even with the dollar decline and the resulting  rise in US exports over the past two years the US still had an annualized trade deficit at the end of fourth quarter of  of about  billion  of GDP
Because US imports are nearly twice as large as US exports it takes a  increase in exports to balance a  increase in imports
That means that the dollar must fall substantially further to shrink the trade deficit to a sustainable level
Investors around the world to want to reduce their dollar holdings for three major reasons
First interest rates are higher on euro and British bonds than on similar US securities making investments in those currencies more rewarding than investments in dollars
Second since the US has a large trade deficit that can only be cured by a more competitive dollar while the eurozone countries collectively have a trade surplus investors expect a trend decline in the dollar
That predictable dollar decline makes the relative return on holding dollar bonds even lower than the interestrate differential alone implies
Finally investors are adding nearly a trillion dollars worth of net dollar securities to their positions every year thus increasing the risk of continued dollar accumulation
With a lower total yield and increased portfolio risk it is not surprising that investors worldwide want to sell dollars
Although individual foreign investors can sell the dollar securities that they own they can only sell them to other foreign investors
As long as the US has a current account deficit the stock of foreignowned claims on the US economy must rise
But when foreign investors don want to continue to hold dollar securities their attempts to sell them will push down their value until the combination of reduced exposure and reduced fear of further dollar decline makes them willing to hold the outstanding stock of dollar securities
Instead of simply wishing that the dollar would stop falling European governments need to take steps to stimulate domestic demand to replace the loss of sales and jobs that will otherwise accompany the more competitive dollar
This is not an easy task because the European Central Bank must remain vigilant about rising inflation and because many EU countries maintain large fiscal deficits
While the ECB has limited room for maneuver regulatory changes and revenueneutral shifts in the tax structure for example a temporary investment tax credit financed by a temporary increase in the corporate tax rate could provide the stimulus needed to offset declining net exports
It is therefore important that EU governments turn their attention to this challenge
The Decline of Renewable Energy
PRAGUE  Many today believe that renewable energy will let us get off fossil fuels soon
Unfortunately the facts say otherwise
According to International Energy Agency data  of the world energy came from renewables in  the first year that the IEA reported global statistics
In  renewables share was actually lower at 
Yet a new survey shows that Americans believe that the share of renewables in  will be 
In reality it will likely be 
Solar and wind energy account for a trivial proportion of current renewables  about onethird of one percentage point
The vast majority comes from biomass or wood and plant material  humanity oldest energy source
While biomass is renewable it is often neither good nor sustainable
Burning wood in preindustrial Western Europe caused massive deforestation as is occurring in much of the developing world today The indoor air pollution that biomass produces kills more than three million people annually
Likewise modern energy crops increase deforestation displace agriculture and push up food prices
The most renewablesintensive places in the world are also the poorest
Africa gets almost  of its energy from renewables compared to just  for the OECD
Even the European OECD countries at  are below the global average
The reality is that humanity has spent recent centuries getting away from renewables
In  the world obtained  of its energy from renewable sources
That figure has been declining ever since
The momentous move toward fossil fuels has done a lot of good
Compared to  years ago the average person in the United Kingdom today has access to  times more power travels  times farther and has  times more light
Incomes have increased fold
The switch to fossil fuels has also had tremendous environmental benefits
Kerosene saved the whales which had been hunted almost to extinction to provide supposedly enewable whale oil for lighting
Coal saved Europe forests
With electrification indoor air pollution which is much more dangerous than outdoor air pollution disappeared in most of the developed world
And there is one environmental benefit that is often overlooked in  more than  of farmland in the United States was used to produce fodder for horses and mules
Tractors and cars eradicated this huge demand on farmland while ridding cities of manure pollution
Of course fossil fuels brought their own environmental problems
And while technological innovations like scrubbers on smokestacks and catalytic converters on cars have reduced local air pollution substantially the problem of CO emissions remains
Indeed it is the main reason for the world clamor for a return to renewables
To be sure wind and solar have increased dramatically
Since  windgenerated power has grown  per year and solar a phenomenal 
But the growth has been from almost nothing to slightly more than almost nothing
In  wind produced  of the world energy it is now producing 
Solarelectric power has gone from essentially zero to 
Yes Denmark gets a record  of its electricity from wind
But electricity accounts for only  of its final energy use
Europe now gets  of its energy from wind  less than before industrialization when cozy windmills contributed about  and ships sails provided another 
The UK set its record for wind power in  when its share reached   almost three times its level today
Moreover solar and wind will still contribute very little in the coming decades
In the IEA optimistic scenario which assumes that the world governments will fulfill all of their green promises wind will provide  of global energy by  while solar will provide 
Global renewables will most likely increase by roughly  percentage points to  by 
Under unrealistically optimistic assumptions the share could increase five percentage points to 
So we are nowhere near switching back to renewables anytime soon
In the US renewables accounted for  of energy production in 
President Barack Obama administration expects that number almost a century later to increase slightly to  by 
In China renewables share in energy production dropped from  in  to  today in  it will likely be just 
Yet we are paying through the nose for these renewables
In the last  years the world has invested  trillion in clean energy
By  the effort to increase reliance on renewables will cost the European Union alone  billion annually
Spain now pays almost  of its GDP in subsidies for renewables which is more than it spends on higher education
At the end of the century Spain massive investment will have postponed global warming by  hours
Current green energy policies are failing for a simple reason renewables are far too expensive
Sometimes people claim that renewables are actually cheaper
But if renewables were cheaper they wouldn need subsidies and we wouldn need climate policies
Former US Vice President Al Gore climate adviser Jim Hansen put it bluntly uggesting that renewables will let us phase rapidly off fossil fuels in the United States China India or the world as a whole is almost the equivalent of believing in the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy
The solution is to innovate the price of renewables downward
We need a dramatic increase in funding for research and development to make the next generations of wind solar and biomass energy cheaper and more effective
Consider China
Despite the country massive investment in solar and wind it mostly sells solar panels to Western countries at subsidized prices
Wind makes up just  of China energy and solar accounts for 
Meanwhile China has  of the world solar water heaters on rooftops because it is a smart and cheap technology
It needs no subsidies and it produces  times more energy than all of China solar panels
When green renewables are cheaper than fossil fuels they will take over the world
Instead of believing in the Tooth Fairy we should start investing in green RD
The Fallout from India Nuclear Tests
NEW YORK India test of five nuclear bombs in two days setting off three in a day is something new in history is one of those rare events that redraws the map of the world
A terrifying nuclear arms race in South Asia is likely with the distinct danger of nuclear battle between India and Pakistan
The world now awaits Pakistans decision whether or not to test the bombs already reported to be in its possession
North Korea is reneging on agreements to yield key nuclear materials
China is contemplating a full nuclear security guarantee to Pakistan creating a complex unstable foursided nuclear standoff in Asia between India Pakistan China and of course Russia
Nuclear war many regional experts say is more likely now than it ever was in the Cold War
Unlike Russians and Americans of that bygone era South Asia peoples actually have been killing each other over the years by the millions during the partition of India in  and in three wars since then
Moreover India and Pakistan remain divided by a bitter territorial dispute over Kashmir
But this possibility of nuclear war horrifying as it is may not be the most important consequence of Indias test
That consequence is the gaping hole punched in the little known system the world has relied upon against nuclear dangers in the postCold War era
Like sleepers awakened by a shock people across the globe are startled to discover that they are still living in the nuclear age
That little noted system of protection is the one mandated by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty of  signed by  nations which created two tiers of states
The first consisted of the five nations possessing nuclear weapons America Russia Britain France and China which promised under the Treatys Article Six to get rid of them the second consisted of nations that lacking nuclear weapons which promised not to get them
The NPT was an abolition treaty specifying that nonnuclear nations would start at the goal of zero nuclear weapons and that nucleararmed nations would commit themselves to reaching that goal
At some point the two tiers would fuse and the world would be nuclearweaponfree
Nothing like this occurred during the Cold War
Nucleararmed nations built nearly  nuclear weapons bearing the explosive power of about a million six hundred thousand Hiroshimasize bombs
With the Cold War end arms reductions began but the nuclear powers  America in particular  publicly disavowed total nuclear disarmament for the indefinite future in the recent words of Robert Bell of the US National Security Council
The US and the other nuclear powers proposed to keep the twotier system in virtual perpetuity
This is the context in which Indias plunge into folly and peril took place
The news of the day is India defies world opinion Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee proclaimed with insane arrogance
India was in effect saying that if there were to be two classes of nations in the postColdWar world then India was going to be in the first class
It would be a global player in the words of Pramod Mahajan an aide to the Prime Minister
This gambit makes perfect sense if you assume that the postcoldwar world is going to remain nuclear armed and that nuclear arms will remain the main currency of power
But is that to be the case
Do the nuclear powers intend to hold on to their nuclear arsenals indefinitely
Or are these powers now including India prepared by joint agreement to commit themselves to creating a world without nuclear weapons
This is the question India has placed before the world
Indias tests mean that the days of the twotiered system are over
The world is moving toward a single standard and the question is whether that standard will be possession of nuclear weapons or renunciation of them
While India posed this question it cannot answer it
The world preeminently the US must do that
If President Clinton were to embrace the goal of a world without nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction there is reason to hope that other nuclear powers would follow
Welcome as American sanctions against India are the most important response to the Indian tests would be an international debate
Indeed a considerable number of the most prominent figures of the Cold War in Russia and the US support abolition of nuclear weapons including former German chancellor Helmut Schmidt Paul Nitze considered by many the author Americas Cold War nuclear policy former NATO commander Andrew J Goodpaster and Russia General Aleksander Lebed
While proponents admit that a world without nuclear weapons would not be without dangers  especially from governments that might decide to violate abolition agreements  these dangers rate far below the perils of living in the world of uncontrolled nuclear proliferation toward which the Indian tests point
In announcing his sanctions to Indias leaders President Clinton said They have to define the greatness of India in twentyfirst century terms not in terms that everyone else has rejected
But have America and the other nuclear powers really rejected those terms
Are they ready to follow the advice now being given India and let go of their nuclear arsenals
The great nuclear power should demonstrate their resolve not only in words but in deeds
A PostGrowth World
PRINCETON  In a provocative recent paper Robert Gordon of Northwestern University concludes that the rate of technological progress has slowed sharply and that the rise in standards of living at least in the world rich countries is thus set to decelerate
In the twentieth century he says per capita income in the United States doubled about every  years
But the next doubling will likely occur only over  years a pace last seen in the nineteenth century
Longterm growth considerations while recognized as crucial seem distant from the here and now of financial repair and restoration of confidence
So the commentary on Gordon paper has been largely dissociated from the policy discussions addressing the ongoing Great Recession
But a realistic assessment of growth prospects is precisely what is needed right now to design appropriate and feasible policies
Gordon point is not that growth will decelerate in the future but rather that underlying productivity growth moved to a sharply lower trajectory around the year 
We lived the better part of the subsequent decade with a misguided sense of extended prosperity and inflated a financial bubble
Worse we are treating the present as if the bubbly growth from  to  will return
Consider the International Monetary Fund regular projections of world growth
In April  about  months after the Lehman Brothers meltdown the crisis seemed over
The forecast was for world GDP to grow at about  annually until  which is slightly higher than the pace during the precrisis decade while the average annual inflation rate was projected to be lower at 
The future looked bright
Instead after successive revisions world GDP in  is now expected to grow by only  while inflation is forecast to reach  signaling much weaker global economic momentum than was anticipated
Lowerthanexpected growth and higherthanexpected inflation have affected most economies
In  and  the United Kingdom stood out among the advanced economies in this regard but the pattern holds even for Germany
The shine has similarly worn off the BRICs Brazil Russia India and China
Although projections by the IMF and others have been persistently optimistic each setback has been treated as a temporary deviation associated with its own unique cause the Greek bailout the tragic tsunami in Japan the spike in volatility following Standard amp Poor downgrade of US debt and so on
The return to  world growth has merely been pushed back  in the latest forecasts to 
Faith in renewed growth is an illadvised policy strategy
At its core the global economic crisis is a growth crisis
Financial institutions and markets assumed productivity would continue to grow at the pace of the late  which fostered an assetprice boom that conveyed an illusion of wellbeing those not directly involved in the financial bubble were coopted through buoyant international trade
European growth with its heavy dependence on trade received a special boost as did emerging markets
Once the Great Recession began this process operated in reverse unwinding the excesses
But policymakers continued to benchmark recovery prospects to precrisis growth performance
When reality proved otherwise the return of the past was not abandoned but merely postponed
Continuing to assume the resumption of precrisis growth was necessary to justify postponing hard decisions
For example a growth rebound underpins the expectation that the European periphery will not restructure or inflate away its sovereign debt
The assumption that the German economy will accelerate out of its current crawl is essential to confidence in Europe financial safety net and to a banking union that credibly shares risks across the eurozone
Resumption of robust world economic growth is the basis for delaying the implementation of the Basel III bank rules
And if the BRICs slow down they may be more prone to debt and currency crises
What is to be done
Because the elixir of growth in policymakers forecasts cannot be counted on to solve the problems dealing with financial excesses becomes even more urgent
That means more debt restructuring and more bank closures now rather than watering down proposals to rein in freewheeling markets
Looking ahead as Robert Shiller of Yale University has repeatedly emphasized public policy must help to forge futures markets that hedge risks better and more reliably align incentives
There is no magical path to higher productivity growth
Even if Gordon pessimism is excessive the timing of the next breakthrough in technology is impossible to predict
Socalled tructural reforms may help but the likely gains are small and uncertain
It may simply be time to learn how to live with less
The Second Coming of Zhu Rongji
SHANGHAI  The recent release of a book of speeches by former Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has refocused attention on his bold  and often highly controversial  economic reforms of the  which included reining in stateowned enterprises SOEs and overhauling the banking system
But the discussion has taken an unexpected turn with Chinese media adopting a far less critical stance than that which has prevailed for the last two decades
Given the apparent parallels between the challenges that Zhu faced and those that current Premier Li Keqiang is now attempting to address not to mention their shared commitment to economic transformation this shift could signify rising support for structural reform
But are Zhu and Li really so much alike
Today as in the  China is experiencing skyrocketing localgovernment and commercialbank debt rising fiscal and financial risk uncertainty over institutional reform and declining centralgovernment revenue
According to Bloomberg Li will be the first Chinese premier not to fulfill the official annual growth target since Zhu
Despite these apparent similarities however China situation today is fundamentally different from  years ago
In the  Zhu core mission was to address the consequences of former Premier Zhao Ziyang flawed fiscaldecentralization efforts
By pursuing fiscal reform one sector at a time Zhao left room for local governments to form alliances with SOEs which provided subsidies to local bodies and enabled them to withhold income from the central government
This led to the buildup of national public debt which in turn compelled the central bank to overissue currency fueling inflation
In this context Zhu reform strategy was aimed primarily at reestablishing a sound fiscal relationship between the central and local governments rather than at increasing the GDP growth rate
In fact though Zhu reforms were piecemeal they could easily have led to doubledigit GDP growth
But Zhu recognized that allowing such rapid growth probably would have done more harm than good given persistent inflation and macroeconomic instability
Critics assert that Zhu  tax reform led to the current realestate bubble because it drove local governments to use land sales to boost their incomes
But the fact is that replacing the incomesharing system with a taxsharing system stabilized China economy and reversed the relative decline of centralgovernment revenue
Indeed it was essential to China economic development
By weakening the alliances between local governments and SOEs Zhu taxsharing system facilitated the strategic restructuring of the stateowned economy
And by galvanizing local governments to privatize local SOEs as well as housing and some public services Zhu reform hastened China incorporation into the global economy
China stateowned economy is far less bloated today the central and local governments have fewer compatibility problems the country fiscal position is strong and relative macroeconomic stability prevails
Zhu success means that Li must focus on a different challenge
Li must ensure that China economy which still boasts significant growth potential does not sink into lethargy and fall into the socalled iddleincome trap
A developing economy may slow prematurely when external factors alter the conditions supporting growth
Wages continue to rise reducing competitiveness visvis lowincome economies but the growth model is not yet equipped to support competitiveness in highskill industries leading to stagnation
In order to avoid such an outcome Li must adapt China growth model to current conditions which include intensifying trade friction with the European Union and the United States greater pressure to allow the renminbi to appreciate an aging population slowing urbanization and rising labor costs
The ew normal that has emerged from the global financial crisis characterized by sluggish GDP growth and diminished import demand in the West makes reform even more urgent
Li should begin by redistributing industrial capital from highproductivity coastal areas
This would instantly augment growth in lessdeveloped regions and boost overall productivity
But with competition in the global supply chain fiercer than ever China will need more than capital transfer to achieve highincome status
It will need policies and mechanisms that encourage and guide technological and industrial upgrading
Fortunately Li seems to understand this
Indeed industrial and technological upgrading forms the core of ikonomics
But significant uncertainty remains over how to achieve it within the constraints of China stateled economy
Over the last decade  especially since   China central government has been tightening its grip on industrial policy while enhancing the State Council dominance over local governments
By contrast Li seems intent on returning power to local governments and the market transforming vertical control into horizontal coordination
Thus instead of trying to control technological and industrial upgrading with central mandates Li is giving local governments and the market the space to drive China economic transformation
Zhu and Li do have one thing in common they both came to power at a critical juncture in China development
But whereas Zhu had to grapple with local officials to increase the central government authority and revenue thereby stabilizing the economy and unleashing China growth potential Li must cooperate with local governments to create a system that fosters and protects new sources of innovation and economic dynamism at all levels
Just as Zhu reforms two decades ago laid the foundation for today growth whether Li succeeds may well determine China economic trajectory for the next  years
The False Panacea of LaborMarket Flexibility
AMSTERDAM  Competitiveness has become one of the economic buzzwords of our time
Barack Obama trumpeted it during his State of the Union address in January and European leaders from the Tory David Cameron in Britain to the Socialist Jos Luis Zapatero in Spain to Japan new Minister of Economics Kaoru Yosano have embraced it as a priority
But what sort of competitiveness do they have in mind
Asked during an interview in September  whether European governments should liberalize their countries labor codes former United States Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan responded that Europe laborprotection laws significantly inhibited economic performance and resulted in chronically high unemployment across the continent
In the United States people are fired more easily than in any other country and the unemployment rate at the time was among the lowest in the world
But it no longer September  and US unemployment stands at  not 
And according to Greenspan successor Ben Bernanke there is no reason to assume that the unemployment rate will approach   generally considered to be the natural rate of unemployment  any time soon
In the  the US lost two million privatesector jobs on balance with the total falling from  million in December  to  million in December  despite massive consumer spending
That  decline came during a decade in which the US population grew by about 
To understand what is happening consider Evergreen Solar the thirdlargest maker of solar panels in the US which announced in January that it would close its main American factory lay off its  workers there within two months and shift production to China
Evergreen management cited the much higher government support available in China as its reason for the move
Evergreen is only one of many cases suggesting that the US might find itself in the midst of what Princetoneconomist Alan Blinder in  dubbed the Third Industrial Revolution
According to Blinder  million US jobs  about onethird of all public and privatesector jobs in the country  are vulnerable for offshoring
Blinder also predicted that the flexible fluid US labor market would adapt better and faster to globalization than European labor markets would
If anything we are only in the early stages of that revolution and the outcome remains uncertain
But a preliminary comparison between Europe largest economy Germany and the US suggests that the former is better equipped to hold its own in the age of globalization
German multinationals like Siemens and Daimler are ratcheting up investment to meet both emergingmarket and domestic demand
The companies plan to add hundreds of thousands of jobs worldwide this year alone
While many of these jobs will be in Asia both companies say that they will add highskill jobs in Germany as well
Is Germany labormarket rigidity to thank for that
It may indeed be part of the explanation
A recent study by the Central Planning Bureau in the Netherlands shows that workers with a permanent contract receive more employerfunded training than workers with a temporary contract
For US employers it is much easier to purge workers from the payroll  or as Robert Gordon of Northwestern University puts it to toss out every deck chair  than it is for German employers
Germany labor code bars such layoffs but German employers also are presumably less inclined than US employers to shed workers because they have invested more in their companies human capital
With fewer firmspecific skills than their German counterparts American workers are more susceptible to layoffs
Indeed Siemens apparently conscious of the benefits of labormarket rigidity has taken the unusual step of promising its employees a job for life
Last year the company sealed an agreement with the trade union IG Metall that includes a nolayoff pledge for its strong German workforce
A more important explanation for Germany current economic success may be the substantial government support that German industries receive on a structural basis especially the car industry
The US economy on the other hand is bogging down in its policymakers persistent emphasis on consumption and tax cuts most notably for the superrich over investment
The US needs to change its economicpolicy course
A decade of historically low interest rates has led to economic imbalances in favor of sectors that are highly leveraged the financial sector the housing market and private equity
This has come at the expense of sectors that are more dependent on equity financing
Now that the housing bubble has burst the US finds itself outtrained outeducated and outmaneuvered in the global competition for employment
We now know that labormarket deregulation does not ensure economic resilience and rapid job creation
On the contrary the best solution is probably a diversity of labor contracts
A certain amount of labormarket rigidity may make economic sense for jobs that require firmspecific skills and training alongside greater flexibility for jobs that require fewer skills
The False Promise of argeted Sanctions
Despite his bellicose rhetoric George W Bush would very much like to avoid a choice between air strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and accepting a nuclear Iran
For the moment administration officials are hoping that argeted sanctions aimed directly at Iran leadership will compel a compromise
The United Nations Security Council recent decision to tighten existing sanctions on Iran by prohibiting dealings with  individuals and  organizations aims at precisely that
But while some within the US government argue that similar sanctions induced North Korea to compromise on its nuclear program there are several reasons why the same strategy is unlikely to work with Iran
First and foremost targeted sanctions did not in fact really work with North Korea
The freeze on  million of the leadership assets held at Banco Delta Asia in Macau has certainly irritated the North Koreans
But the asset freeze did not prevent Kim JongIl from ordering a ballistic missile test last July or an underground nuclear test in October
Instead North Korea willingness to resume negotiations partly reflects the Americans decision to stop insisting on the omplete verifiable irreversible dismantlement of North Korea nuclear program as a precondition for talks on normalizing relations
The Bush administration has accepted that North Korea is a nuclear power and that outsiders can do little about it so the United States has shifted its diplomatic stance from the hardline Japanese approach to the more flexible and stabilityoriented Chinese position
That shift is understandable
Given its simultaneous military commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan together with North Korea demonstrated nuclear capability the Bush administration can credibly threaten Kim with force
Sanctions have rattled the North Korean leadership but not nearly enough to compel them to surrender fully the nuclear program which is their ultimate guarantee of security
At the same time the North Koreans willingness to make a deal also reflects China decision to put its foot down
China remains the only foreign power with any real leverage over Kim government
Exasperated by Kim refusal to ease international tensions Chinese officials have made clear their refusal to protect and subsidize North Korea elite if it continues to push the US toward confrontation
The Chinese can force Kim to disarm fully but they can persuade him to negotiate with a now more flexible US
As a result the US and North Korea have agreed a deal that differs from the Clintonera greed Framework mainly because North Korea now has a track record as both a deal breaker and a nuclear weapons state
Having returned to the bargaining table in a position of strength North Korea now hopes to secure a compromise that frees up the leadership assets and brings new benefits that help buttress the regime a little longer
As long as the Chinese talk tough and the US remains willing to negotiate the agreement may hold
But neither diplomatic stance is likely to continue indefinitely
In any case none of this will help the Bush administration with Iran
No outside actor has the leverage with Iran that China has with North Korea and even if the US offered Iran a more conciliatory approach the Democraticled Congress isn likely to follow suit
Buffeted by criticism that their position on the war in Iraq is incoherent and that they are soft on security threats the Democrats appear determined to ratchet up pressure on Iran favoring much broader sanctions than the Bush administration has proposed
For example House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Tom Lantos has introduced legislation that would extend the extraterritorial reach of US law to foreign governments export credit agencies financial institutions insurers underwriters and guarantors
It would bar foreign subsidiaries of US companies from investing more than  million in Iran energy sector and would eliminate the president authority to waive these penalties
It would also designate Iran Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist group and impose further limits on exports to the country civil aviation industry
Moreover Republicans are getting in on the act
Representative Ileana RosLehtinen has introduced legislation that would require US government pension funds private pension funds and mutual funds sold or distributed in the US to divest from companies that invest more than  million in Iran
Finally just as Iran faces no China  an outside player with considerable domestic influence  North Korea faces no Israel a neighbor that believes its security could depend on an act of military preemption
Israel does not want to take on Iran without US support and will maintain pressure on both Congress and the president to threaten Iran with every means at its disposal
The appeal of targeted sanctions against Iran is obvious they are meant to help the administration avoid military action which could create more problems than it solves
They allow the White House to argue that it means to undermine Iran leadership not its people
They are also much more likely to win international support than sanctions that would remove Iran oil and gas supplies from the international marketplace
But the chances are slim that sanctions whether targeted or otherwise can undermine the consensus within Iran in favor of the nuclear program
As in North Korea a nuclear capability constitutes a powerful symbol of the country sovereignty and international clout  and would be the ultimate guarantee that America could never do there what it has done in Iraq
Sanctions give lawmakers and diplomats plenty to talk about
But unless a sea change occurs in Iranian domestic politics they will merely postpone the difficult and increasingly likely choice between military action and accepting a nuclear Iran
The False Promise of CrisisResolution Funds
ROME  Ever since financial markets began to stabilize late last year the idea of making the financial sector pay for the costs incurred by taxpayers to keep it afloat has gained increasing support among policymakers and the wider public
France and the United Kingdom have introduced a temporary tax on financialsector bonuses and the United States government has proposed legislation envisaging a inancial crisis responsibility fee to recover the costs of America Troubled Asset Relief Program
There is also a discussion about how best to reform taxation of the financial sector which is on average lighter relative to other corporate income and unduly favors borrowing over equity financing
But a lumpsum charge to recover past costs will not change the financial sector incentives concerning excessive risktaking
Furthermore it is unclear what precisely the costs are that are to be recovered
While the direct fiscal costs of supporting the financial sector were  of GDP in developed countries with peaks around  the total fiscal impact of the crisis is much larger amounting to the total expected increase in public debt  an estimated  of GDP
And even larger yet is the total cost suffered by the economy  including output and job losses and the attendant destruction of material and immaterial capital which according to the Bank of England Andrew Haldane and others could rise to a multiple of annual GDP
More recently the debate has changed tack taxing the financial sector is now seen as a convenient way to set aside sufficient resources to pay for the next financial crisis
The idea of a tax on the financial sector has become closely associated with that of a crisisresolution fund
This would pay for the residual costs of a large institution failure after its capital has fallen to zero and presumably creditors claims have been wiped out though some proposals are ambiguous leaving room for at least some relief for creditors
The IMF presented one such proposal to the leaders of the G when they met in Washington in April
Other versions were recently put forth by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament and the European Commission
To me these proposals seem poorly conceived for two reasons
The first is obvious any bailout fund for financial institutions creates an implicit promise of a bailout
Sooner or later someone will call upon that promise
If the fund is public it will encourage private beneficiaries to free ride on taxpayers
If it is privately financed swindlers will be encouraged to freeride on honest bankers
The only way to avoid this undesirable result is credibly to exclude all support for shareholders and creditors of a financial institution heading toward bankruptcy
They must realize that government will not ride to their rescue
Only in this manner will shareholders and creditors have a sufficiently strong incentive to monitor management and keep a tight lid on risktaking by banks or other financial intermediaries
Once it is accepted that shareholders and creditors deserve no relief the resolution fund simply becomes deposit insurance
Retail depositors are the only creditors in the financial system that deserve ample if not full protection against the mistakes of their bankers
After all the main source of systemic instability in financial systems is excessive leverage  and the reckless lending that it enables  by deposittaking institutions
Depositinsurance fees are the appropriate instrument by which to make banks pay both for their intrinsic riskiness and the risks they impose on the rest of the system
Regulation then must ensure that bankers don abuse their charter by taking excessive risks with their depositors money  which is precisely where regulators failed most notably in recent years opening the way to the financial crisis
This brings me to the second often less readily recognized objection to a resolution fund banking and quasibanking losses were huge in the recent financial crisis because regulators closed their eyes to misdeeds in order to ensure bankers international competitiveness or more simply because they had been aptured by them
If supervisors behave as they should large residual losses from bank failures become unlikely
So in order to keep residual losses small supervisors must be obliged to undertake early corrective action when a bank capital weakens which is how the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation operates
If a bank cannot be recapitalized it should be resolved and liquidated
This is where effective resolution procedures become important
But the key point is that no reckless exposure would be possible in a system where shareholders and creditors knew that they would not be bailed out and supervisors were not allowed to gamble on resurrection of their supervised entities but rather were obliged to call them to account as soon as they started misbehaving
In the effort to build a strong and coherent regulatory system for financial markets the idea of a resolution fund is at best a distraction  and at worst a harbinger of further financial instability
The False Promise of Debt Relief
With debt relief for poor countries shaping up as a focal issue at the July G summit in Scotland it is a shame that so few people appreciate what a farce such measures could turn out to be
Unfortunately most of the public egged on by wellmeaning rock stars religious leaders and other popular figures seem brainwashed into believing that debt relief is a giant step on the road to ending world poverty
But forgiving poor countries debts without agreeing on a better framework for future aid flows is an empty gesture
At first glance it seems incredibly generous and statesmanlike for G leaders to endorse debt relief for the world poorest nations
But no one really expects the debts to be paid anyway
Indeed thanks to ongoing grants and future loans from national aid agencies and multilateral lenders like the World Bank most of the poor ebtor countries look set to receive considerably more money than they pay back with no end in sight
Citizens of rich countries may be selfcentered and selfindulgent but things are not quite as horrible as some would have us believe
True the ultrarich United States does only give a pathetic  of its income in aid
But at least it doesn tax poor countries as richcountry imperialists did until well into the twentieth century
Besides it is not like there is huge profit for G leaders in trying to collect coins from impoverished peoples living on a dollar a day
What would the G leaders do station troops in Africa to seize coffee beans and peanuts
Recolonize Africa
Debt collection from poor nations is an absurdity now and into the distant future
The real issue is how much money richcountry governments will be giving poorcountry governments not vice versa
Thirdworld debt burdens are little more than a scorecard for past development failures
Generously interpreted past loans reflected nave optimism that with a bit of seed money politically and economically backward countries would generate majestic growth and effortlessly repay their loans
A notsogenerous interpretation of modern aid history is that rich countries legislatures were too cheap to give outright grants to the poorest countries and could be persuaded to help out only if they were told that the money would be repaid
Of course I am focusing mainly on official loans but privatesector lending to the world poorest countries is generally a relatively minor issue
So now rich countries want to feel magnanimous for orgiving debts that should have been given as outright grants in the first place
As all but the most belligerent critics of US President George W Bush will acknowledge America has taken an important lead in trying to make things marginally better
The Bush administration has put outright grants at the center of its foreignassistance policy a commitment that is embodied in its new aid agency the illennium Challenge Account
Moreover following recent changes at the World Bank the US is aiming to follow the classic doctor dictum irst do no harm
It is increasing aid but it is trying to focus the benefits on countries that are reasonably well governed
The aim is praiseworthy to ensure that aid will be unambiguously beneficial and won merely be exploited by bad governments to extend their hold on power
Admittedly there is still a fierce debate over the right way to assist poor countries and this will play out behind the scenes at the G summit
Many Europeans believe that aid agencies like the World Bank will shrivel and die if left to depend on grants for income
But I believe that the problem could easily be solved by say giving the World Bank an endowment of richcountry bonds and permitting it to expend the interest
The United Nations Development Program has championed the position that all countries should get significant aid regardless of how they are governed on the grounds that thousands of children die every day and there is no room for sanctimonious extremism
I beg to differ my reading of the evidence suggests that donors really do need to take extreme care not to make things worse and that this is far more difficult to achieve in corrupt countries than the UN suggests
In short the fundamental problem with the debtrelief mantra is that it looks backward rather than forward
If the G leaders are serious about helping poor countries finding a reliable way to support grant aid and promote accountability for donors and recipients not debt relief is the place to start
If the political will were there it would be neither difficult nor expensive to restructure aid agencies like the World Bank and the regional development banks as grantsonly agencies
For example Professor Jeremy Bulow of Stanford University and I have shown that by endowing the World Bank with  billion dollars it could carry out the tasks that it performs best more effectively and with greater transparency than it does today through borrowing and lending
Given today exceptionally low longterm interest rates the annual cost would be well peanuts
The Electric Car Short Circuit
PRAGUE  For decades the idea of the electric car has captured the imaginations of innovators  including Henry Ford and Thomas Edison more than a century ago
Celebrities pundits and political leaders alike have cast these vehicles as the apotheosis of an environmentally responsible future
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has proclaimed that there will be a million electric cars on the Autobahn by 
President Barack Obama has likewise promised a million electric cars in the United States  but five years sooner
Someday the electric car will indeed be a great product  just not now
It costs too much it is inconvenient and its environmental benefits are negligible and in some cases nonexistent
Many developed countries provide lavish subsidies for electric cars amounts up to  in the US  in Canada   in Belgium and  even in cashstrapped Spain
Denmark offers the most lavish subsidy of all exempting electric cars from the country marginal  registration tax on all other vehicles
For the world most popular electric car the Nissan Leaf this exemption is worth 
Yet this is clearly not enough
In Denmark there are still only  electric cars
In Germany car sales totaled  million in  but only  were electric
The numbers have forced Obama and Merkel to reconcile their projections with reality
The US Department of Energy now expects only about  electric cars by    of all cars on America roads
Merkel recently admitted that Germany will not get anywhere near one million electric cars by 
No one should be surprised
According to an analysis by the US Congressional Budget Office a typical electric car lifetime cost is roughly  higher than a gasolinepowered car
Recent research indicates that electric cars may reach breakeven price with hybrids only in  and with conventional cars in  after governments spend  billion in subsidies
Costs and subsidies aside electric cars have so far proven to be incredibly inconvenient
A BBC reporter drove the  kilometers  miles from London to Edinburgh in an electric Mini and had to stop eight times to recharge  often waiting six hours or more
In total he spent  hours waiting or driving averaging just ten kilometers per hour  an unenviable pace even before the advent of the steam engine
Electric cars also fail to live up to their environmental billing
They are often sold as ero emissions vehicles but that is true only when they are moving
For starters the manufacturing process that produces electric cars  especially their batteries  requires an enormous amount of energy most of it generated with fossil fuels
A lifecycle analysis shows that almost half of an electric car entire CO emissions result from its production more than double the emissions resulting from the production of a gasolinepowered car
Moreover the electricity required to charge an electric car is overwhelmingly produced with fossil fuels
Yes it then emits about half the CO of a conventional car for every kilometer driven using European electricity
But given its high CO emissions at the outset it needs to be driven a lot to come out ahead
Proponents proudly proclaim that if an electric car is driven about  kilometers  miles it will have emitted less than half the CO of a gasolinepowered car
But its battery will likely need to be replaced long before it reaches this target implying many more tons of CO emissions
In fact such distances seem implausible given electric cars poor range the Nissan Leaf for example can go only  kilometers on a charge
That is why most people buy an electric car as their second car for short commutes
If the car is driven less than  kilometers on European electricity it will have emitted more CO overall than a conventional car
Even if driven much farther  kilometers an electric car CO emissions will be only  less than those of a gasolinepowered car
During the car lifetime this will prevent  tons of CO emissions or about  of climate damage
Given the size of the subsidies on offer this is extremely poor value
Denmark subsidies for example pay almost  to avoid one ton of CO emissions
Purchasing a similar amount in the European Emissions Trading System would cost about 
For the same money Denmark could have reduced CO emissions more than a thousandfold
Worse electric cars bought in the European Union will actually increase global CO emissions
Because the EU has a fixed emission target for  it will offset emissions elsewhere perhaps with more wind power regardless of the type of car purchased  tons of CO from a gasoline car and  tons from the electricity produced for an electric car
But while EU emissions stay the same most electric batteries come from Asia so an extra  tons of emissions will not be offset
The electric car environmental transgressions are even worse in China where most electricity is produced with coal
An electric car powered with that electricity will emit  more CO than a gasolinepowered car
And as a recent study shows because China coalfired power plants are so dirty electric cars make the local air worse
In Shanghai air pollution from an additional million gasolinepowered cars would kill an estimated nine people each year
But an additional million electric cars would kill  people annually owing to the increase in coal pollution
The electriccar mantra diverts attention from what really matters a costeffective transition from fossil fuels to cheaper green energy which requires research and innovation
Electric cars might be a great advance for that purpose in a couple of decades
But lavish subsidies today simply enable an expensive inconvenient and often environmentally deficient technology
The False Promise of Financial Liberalization
Something is amiss in the world of finance
The problem is not another financial meltdown in an emerging market with the predictable contagion that engulfs neighboring countries
Even the most exposed countries handled the last round of financial shocks in May and June  relatively comfortably
Instead the problem this time around is one that relatively calm times have helped reveal the predicted benefits of financial globalization are nowhere to be seen
Financial globalization is a recent phenomenon
One could trace its beginnings to the  when recycled petrodollars fueled large capital inflows to developing nations
But it was only around  that most emerging markets threw caution to the wind and removed controls on private portfolio and bank flows
Private capital flows have exploded since dwarfing trade in goods and services
So the world has experienced true financial globalization only for  years or so
Freeing up capital flows had an inexorable logic  or so it seemed
Developing nations the argument went have plenty of investment opportunities but are short of savings
Foreign capital inflows would allow them to draw on the savings of rich countries increase their investment rates and stimulate growth
In addition financial globalization would allow poor nations to smooth out the boomandbust cycles associated with temporary termsoftrade shocks and other bouts of bad luck
Finally exposure to the discipline of financial markets would make it harder for profligate governments to misbehave
But things have not worked out according to plan
Research at the IMF of all places as well as by independent scholars documents a number of puzzles and paradoxes
For example it is difficult to find evidence that countries that freed up capital flows have experienced sustained economic growth as a result
In fact many emerging markets experienced declines in investment rates
Nor on balance has liberalization of capital flows stabilized consumption
Most intriguingly the countries that have done the best in recent years are those that relied the least on foreign financing
China the world growth superstar has a huge currentaccount surplus which means that it is a net lender to the rest of the world
Among other highgrowth countries Vietnam current account is essentially balanced and India has only a small deficit
Latin America Argentina and Brazil have been running comfortable external surpluses recently
In fact their newfound resilience to capitalmarket shocks is due in no small part to their becoming net lenders to the rest of the world after years as net borrowers
To understand what is going on we need a different explanation of what keeps investment and growth low in most poor nations
Whereas the standard story  the one that motivated the drive to liberalize capital flows  is that developing countries are savingconstrained the fact that capital is moving outward rather than inward in the most successful developing countries suggests that the constraint lies elsewhere
Most likely the real constraint lies on the investment side
The main problem seems to be the paucity of entrepreneurship and low propensity to invest in plant and equipment  what Keynes called ow animal spirits  especially to raise output of products that can be traded on world markets
Behind this shortcoming lay various institutional and market distortions associated with industrial and other modernsector activities in lowincome environments
When countries suffer from low investment demand freeing up capital inflows does not do much good
What businesses in these countries need is not necessarily more finance but the expectation of larger profits for their owners
In fact capital inflows can make things worse because they tend to appreciate the domestic currency and make production in export activities less profitable further weakening the incentive to invest
Thus the pattern in emerging market economies that liberalized capital inflows has been lower investment in the modern sectors of the economy and eventually slower economic growth once the consumption boom associated with the capital inflows plays out
By contrast countries like China and India which avoided a surge of capital inflows managed to maintain highly competitive domestic currencies and thereby kept profitability and investment high
The lesson for countries that have not yet made the leap to financial globalization is clear beware
Nothing can kill growth more effectively than an uncompetitive currency and there is no faster route to currency appreciation than a surge in capital inflows
For those countries that have already made the leap the choices are more difficult
Managing the exchange rate becomes much more difficult when capital is free to come and go as it pleases
But it is not impossible  as long as policymakers understand the critical role played by the exchange rate and the need to subordinate capital flows to the requirements of competitiveness
Given all the effort that the world merging markets have devoted to shielding themselves from financial volatility they have reason to ask where in the world is the upside of financial liberalization
That is a question all of us should consider
The False Promise of Global Governance Standards
Cambridge  In the wake of last year global financial meltdown there is now widespread recognition that inadequate investor protection can significantly affect how stock markets and economies develop as well as how individual firms perform
The increased focus on improving corporate governance has produced a demand for reliable standards for evaluating governance in publicly traded companies worldwide
World Bank officials shareholder advisers and financial economists have all made considerable efforts to develop such standards
The notion of a single set of criteria to evaluate the governance of publicly traded firms worldwide is undoubtedly appealing
Both investors and publicly traded firms are operating in increasingly integrated global capital markets
But the quest for a single set of global governance standards is misguided
Yes over the last decade there has been growing use of global governance standards largely developed in the United States to assess how countries and companies around the world protect minority investors
But these efforts have overlooked fundamental differences between controlled companies which have a controlling shareholder and widely held firms that lack such a controller
While widely held firms dominate the capital markets of the US and the UK controlled companies dominate in most other countries
Widely held and controlled companies differ considerably in the governance problems their investors face
In widely held firms the concern is about opportunism by managers who exercise de facto control in controlled firms the concern is about opportunism by the controlling shareholder at the expense of minority shareholders
Because the basic governance problems in the two types of firms are considerably different arrangements that benefit investors in widely held firms might be irrelevant or even counterproductive in controlled firms and vice versa
As a result applying a single standard for assessing investor protection worldwide is bound to miss the mark with respect to widely held firms controlled firms or both
Consider for example the Corporate Governance Quotient system developed by the US firm RiskMetrics the world dominant shareholder advisory firm
RiskMetrics system which is used by institutional investors around the world attaches considerable weight to the arrangements governing contests for control
These arrangements are indeed important for investors in widely held firms
When a company has a controlling shareholder however control contests are not possible and the arrangements governing such contests are thus irrelevant
Investors and public officials in countries where controlled companies dominate should stop using global governance standards based on the designers experience with widely held firms in the US
Rather they should strive to develop standards appropriate for controlled firms
Most obviously assessments of controlled companies should not give significant weight to arrangements governing contests for corporate control
Similarly arrangements that make the firm board of directors more responsive to the wishes of a majority of shareholders such as making it easier for shareholders to replace directors can serve the interests of investors in widely held firms but are counterproductive for investors in controlled firms
In controlled firms where the concern is diversion from minority shareholders making directors even more responsive to the controller will likely make minority investors still more vulnerable
Moreover in countries that have many controlled firms close attention should be paid to relatedparty transactions and to the taking of corporate opportunities  the main ways in which value may be diverted from minority investors in such firms
To address such problems arrangements that enable a minority of shareholders to veto related party transactions  arrangements which are not warranted in widely held firms  could well be valuable
Finally when assessing controlled companies the independence of directors should not be judged largely by looking at the extent to which they are independent of the company on whose board they serve
Rather considerable attention should be given to their independence from the controlling shareholder
To improve corporate governance and investor protection public officials and investors in countries whose capital markets are dominated by controlled companies should be wary of global governance standards developed for US companies
They should focus on the special problems of controlled companies and on the rules that would work best for protecting smaller investors in such companies
The False Promise of Green Jobs
COPENHAGEN  Political rhetoric has shifted away from the need to respond to the enerational challenge of climate change
Investment in alternative energy technologies like solar and wind is no longer peddled on environmental grounds
Instead we are being told of the purported economic payoffs above all the promise of socalled reen jobs
Unfortunately that does not measure up to economic reality
The Copenhagen Consensus Center asked Grcan Glen a senior energy economist at the Center for Energy Economics Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin to assess the tate of the science in defining measuring and predicting the creation of green jobs
Glen concluded that job creation annot be defended as another benefit of wellmeaning green policies
In fact the number of jobs that these policies create is likely to be offset  or worse  by the number of jobs that they destroy
On the face of it greenjob creation seems straightforward
Deploying more wind turbines and solar panels creates a need for more builders technicians tradespeople and specialist employees
Voil simply by investing in green policies we have not only helped the climate but also lowered unemployment
Indeed this is the essence of many studies that politicians are eagerly citing
So what did those analyses get wrong
In some cases Glen finds that proponents of green jobs have not distinguished between construction jobs building the wind turbines which are temporary and longerterm operational jobs keeping the wind turbines going which are more permanent
Moreover sometimes advocates have assumed without justification that the new jobs would pay more than careers in conventional energy
In other cases the definition of a reen job is so fuzzy that it becomes virtually useless
If a sustainability adviser quits a concrete factory and goes to work instead for a renewable energy project can we really conclude that the number of green jobs has actually increased
More disturbing is Glen finding that some claims of job creation have rested on assumptions of greenenergy production that go far beyond reputable estimates
Of course if you assume that vast swaths of the countryside will be covered in wind turbines and solar panels you will inevitably predict that a large number of construction jobs will be required
But the biggest problem in these analyses is that they often fail to recognize the higher costs or job losses that these policies will cause
Alternative energy sources such as solar and wind create significantly more expensive fuel and electricity than traditional energy sources
Increasing the cost of electricity and fuel will hurt productivity reduce overall employment and cut the amount of disposable income that people have
Yet many studies used by advocates of green jobs have not addressed these costs at all  overlooking both the cost of investment and the price hikes to be faced by end users
The companies calling for political intervention to create green jobs tend to be those that stand to gain from subsidies and tariffs
But because these policies increase the cost of fuel and electricity they imply layoffs elsewhere across many different economic sectors
Once these effects are taken into account the purported increase in jobs is typically wiped out and some economic models show lower overall employment
Despite a significant outlay government efforts to create green jobs could end up resulting in net job losses
Even if that is true proponents might argue investment in green jobs is nonetheless a good way to stimulate a sluggish economy
But Glen shows that there are many other economic sectors such as healthcare that could actually create more jobs for the same amount of government investment
In addition to job creation some researchers have blithely claimed that all sorts of other economic benefits will accrue from investment in alternative energy including increased productivity higher disposable incomes and lower operating costs for businesses
Here too Glen concludes that the assertions are ot backed up by any evidence and are inconsistent with the realities of green technologies and energy markets
The fundamental problem is that greenenergy technologies are still very inefficient and expensive compared to fossil fuels
Deploying less efficient more expensive alternativeenergy sources will hurt businesses and consumers not help them
In order for the whole planet to make a sustainable shift away from fossil fuels we need to make lowcarbon energy both cheaper and more efficient
That requires a substantial increase in research and development into nextgeneration greenenergy alternatives
Today research budgets are tiny and that desperately needs to change
In the meantime the public should be cautious of politicians claims that deploying today inefficient expensive technology will result in windfall benefits at no cost
The False Promise of Later Retirement
EU Economics Commissioner Pedro Solbes warns that Europes shrinking population will soon hit the Continents economies hard
Reforms to defuse the crisis are needed
Alain Jousten examines one alluring but false reform that is often discussed
Social welfare systems are shaking as never before
Not only in Europe but in parts of North and South America and Asia as well
A collapse in fertility rates coupled with longer life expectancy is driving a rapid and pronounced aging of populations
Worse still the demographic threat is being heightened by the way most countries finance their public pension schemes 
Many retirement systems rely heavily on a payasyougo PAYG philosophy
Rather than forcing each generation to pay for its own retirement benefits paid to todays pensioners are financed by contributions from the young 
Intergenerational solidarity however is only as strong as the number of entrants into the labor force
When this number falls as a result of lower fertility rates and when higher life expectancy swells the ranks of pensioners the only way to sustain PAYG systems is to decrease the level of benefits relative to contributions 
The technical remedies for restoring financial balance are rather straightforward and entail either explicit or implicit measures
An explicit remedy is to raise revenues through higher contributions increased labor force participation stronger productivity growth or larger transfers from general tax revenue
Alternatively the number of working years required to qualify for a full retirement benefit can be increased 
What is the most effective method
Many experts advocate raising the official retirement age as an efficient tool because it wouldin theory at leastincrease the pool of contributors while shrinking the pool of benefit recipients
Unfortunately this intuitively simple expectation does not fit with what actually happens in most industrialized countries 
What actually happens is that the average retirement age is sometimes noticeably lower than the earliest eligible age for the normal retirement system
The period between departure from paid employment and entry into PAYG programs is bridged on a countryspecific basis by a plethora of public private or mixed earlyretirement benefit arrangements such as unemployment insurance disability insurance or some form of severance pay 
Besides the generosity of benefits there is the issue of when one can first claim them
Individuals respond to the incentives created by the variety of earlyretirement and retirement programs
The accessibility of early retirement varies widely across different countries and different sectors
While paths to retirement as early as age  exist in some countries in others the lowest eligible age is much higher 
Recent studies show that financial incentives to promote earlier retirement are sometimes powerful so much so that continuing to work becomes a prohibitively expensive
The implicit tax from working another year and forgoing pension benefits can sometimes be close to a persons net earnings during that year
This type of extreme financial incentive is particularly true in some countries like Belgium or the Netherlands with easily accessible early retirement schemes  schemes which to boot often fail to adjust benefit levels to offset their longer duration 
It is argued that early retirement systems cater to needs that are different from those addressed by traditional PAYG schemes
Many European governments used compulsory early retirement to push down the unemployment rate effectively reducing the number of applicants for any given job by ridding the labor market of older more expensive workers
Such policies also facilitated structural change as older workers often lack the skills required in emerging economic sectors 
However early retirement schemes also imply tremendousand often neglectedcosts for government budgets and the pension systems by increasing benefit payments while reducing contributions
But even leaving aside the fiscal implications many labor economists now believe that early retirement has failed to open up jobs for young people and reduce unemployment rates 
Early retirement policies everywhere stand in clear need of reform
It is illogical to continue subsidizing a compulsory exit from the labor force while simultaneously trying to safeguard public retirement systems in the face of tremendous demographic challenges
It is all the more irrational in view of the rather modest effects early retirement plans have on unemployment in general and on youth unemployment in particular 
But reform should not be confined to public retirement systems
Instead change must be comprehensive and include an overhaul of the myriad pathways to early retirement
An increase in the official retirement age  currently close to  in most countries  is pointless to the extent that many people no longer exit the labor force directly into official retirement systems
In Belgium for example only onethird of men exit the labor force directly to one of the public retirement systems
The rest pass through some type of early retirement scheme 
Tightening the rules governing accessibility to different early retirement systems is more likely to be effective than raising the official retirement age
But reform of early retirement rules should not completely cut off access to social insurance programs before say age 
There is a considerable degree of heterogeneity in any population so it is neither fair nor desirable that everyone should be forced to retire at the same age 
The False Promise of Private Pensions
One of the strangest claims made in the debates about social insurance now roiling the world richest countries is the that governmentfunded definedbenefit pension programs such as America Social Security system are outmoded
These programs were fine the argument goes for the industrial economy of the Great Depression and the postWorld War II generation but they have become obsolete in today hightech networked postindustrial economy
Advocates of this argument propose a different model
Just as corporations today are much happier supporting workers pensions by contributing to employees private accounts so governments today should offer or require contributions to privately owned accounts
The value of these accounts would fluctuate with the market rather than resting on a definedbenefit scheme that guarantees a fixed real sum of resources available upon retirement
This argument is strange because it gets the economics of the situation backward
When there are lots of companies offering workers longterm definedbenefit retirement pensions there are fewer advantages to the government in setting up a parallel definedbenefit scheme and requiring workers to participate in it
After all in such a world workers who set great value on a definedbenefit pension can go to work for firms that offer such pensions
The major benefits that arise from the government requiring that workers also participate in a national Social Security system accrue to those workers who really ought to value a definedbenefit pension highly but have not been able to figure out what their true preferences are
They also accrue to relatively poor workers who lack the bargaining power to induce bosses to offer the pensions they really want  and need
But there aren a lot of companies today that are willing to offer longterm definedbenefit pension schemes
One reason is that companies nowadays are much more aware of their own longrun fragility than they were in the postWorld War II decades
Not even America IBM  which prides itself on stability  wants to take the risk of offering definedbenefit schemes
The risk from definedbenefit pensions used to be offset by two benefits for companies that offered them
First the fact that leaving the company usually meant cashing in one pension at a discount increased worker loyalty
Second complaisant accountants optimistic assumptions about returns on pension reserves together with large firms greater riskbearing capacity brightened the financial picture that companies could report to investors
Today the risks are seen to be much greater and the benefits are seen to be less
As a result an eversmaller slice of employers are offering anything like definedbenefit pensions
This falloff in private definedbenefit pensions all across the rich core of the world economy is a bad thing because the configuration of asset prices suggests that young and middleaged workers value definedbenefit pensions extremely highly
Historically the gap between expected returns on lowrisk assets like government or investmentgrade bonds and highrisk assets like stocks and real estate has been very high
To some degree as economists like Harvard Robert Barro and mathematicians like Benoit Mandelbrot argue this may be because highrisk investments are in reality much more risky than the theories and math of standard finance techniques suggest
In my opinion at least this is partly because the memory of years like  and  when stocks performed very badly occupies too large a place in investors minds
Workers and other asset holders place a very high value on safety security and predictability so a definedbenefit pension plan is extremely valuable
But in today world only national governments are large enough to be able to do so with any assurance that the pension assets will actually be there when workers retire
I am enough of a social democrat to believe that if there is an economic service or benefit that citizens value extremely highly and that only the government can provide then the government should provide it
We economists know that there are many drawbacks to expanding government beyond its basic role of providing true public goods like defense public safety and justice as well as providing citizens with incentives to counterbalance the effects of true market failures
If the private market has the flexibility of two hands government bureaucracy has at best two thumbs
But the collection of payroll taxes from tens of millions of workers and the writing of tens of millions of pension checks is the kind of routine semiautomatic task that government can do well
With private companies backing away from definedbenefit programs it is even more important and valuable that government do it in our postindustrial networkage society than it was in the past
The False Promise of Stability
France Portugal and Germany are all flagrantly flaunting the Stability Pact the agreement among Eurozone members to keep their deficits below a critical threshold  of GDP today but lower supposedly in the future
Frances Prime Minister Pierre Raffarin defends his governments position by saying that France was not prepared to impose austerity on its own people
If France will not other European leaders must wonder why should they
Monsieur Raffarin was right to say that austerity would result if France obeyed the Pacts strictures but in debates over economic policy the truth is seldom appreciated
Telling the truth is something best left to academics whose squabbles make it difficult to discern who is right and who is wrong
A few years ago Alan Blinder then Vice Chairman of Americas Federal Reserve Board was excoriated for stating the obvious that monetary policy should target not only inflation but also unemployment and that at least in the short run there may be a tradeoff between the two
There is a long list of central bankers homilies that are not supposed to be questioned do so and you are exiled from the small circle of those who supposedly know how the world really works
Here are three
An independent central bank is necessary for sound macroeconomic policy The truth countries that do not have an independent central bank like India manage to contain inflation as effectively as those with independent central banks
In Russia an independent central banker Viktor Gerashencko could not be removed for years though he tolerated both inflation and corruption
More generally there is little evidence that countries with independent central banks grow faster have higher wages or generate higher incomesindeed that they perform better in any real sensethan those that do not
Once inflation starts it increases at a faster and faster rate and the costs of reversing it are high The truth there is no evidence of an inflation precipice or that the costs of reversing inflation in terms say of pushing unemployment to high levels are any greater than the benefits from inflation in terms say of allowing unemployment to fall to low levels
Inflation is bad for growth and productivity The truth below a critical thresholda threshold far beyond the levels of inflation that now prevail in Europe and North Americathere is no evidence of significant adverse effects from inflation
On the contrary recent research by Nobel laureate economist George Akerlof and his colleagues suggests that pushing inflation too low may impede growth and that the critical threshold is higher for countries such as the postcommunist transition economies engaged in large structural changes
When an economy faces a downturn one should engage in expansionary fiscal policies
But in a downturn tax revenues fall
Thus debt must increase
But the EUs Stability Pact as commonly interpreted requires either that tax rates be raised always difficult especially in a recession or that expenditures be cut
Either way such policies will exacerbate the downturn
The Stability Pact put into place an automatic economic destabilizer 
But the EUindeed every countryshould seek automatic stabilizers policies that automatically boost the economy in a downturn
The US is facing albeit in somewhat weaker form a similar problem
Most of Americas  states have constitutional amendments that effectively impose a balanced budget
As tax revenues drop due to the economic downturn the states are cutting back on expenditures exacerbating Americas slumpand the worlds
I warned of this problem more than a year ago and I suggested that the Federal government pick up the tab for the shortfall in state tax revenue because the states did not cause the countrys slowdown
At the time there was some disagreement about how long the downturn would last I was a pessimist and unfortunately I have been proved right
But I argued that this was irrelevant making up the states shortfall would cost the government nothing if the optimists turned out to be right but it would be just the right medicine if pessimists like me were correct
Instead the Bush administration pushed ahead with tax cuts for the rich tax cuts that were not designed to stimulate the economy and that no surprise have failed to stimulate the economy
The lesson for Europe is clear the EU should redefine its Stability Pact in terms of the structural or full employment deficitwhat the fiscal deficit would be if the economy were performing at full employment
To do otherwise is irresponsible
There does need to be a commitment to fiscal responsibility
In the long run governments should run balanced budgets with surpluses in good years making up for deficits in bad years
But to insist on an arbitrary budgetary position in an economic downturn is to ignore everything we have learned about economics in the past seventy years risking the well being of millions of workers who are thrown out of employment
The Stability Pact holds another important lesson casting in stone institutional arrangements designed to address the problems of the past is a recipe for failure in the future
In America in the s the Clinton Administration fought demands by Republicans for a balanced budget amendment to the US constitution
US Democrats argued that if America faced an economic downturn the government needed the flexibility to run a deficit
Is there any reason to believe that excessive policy inflexibility works better in Europe
Balancing the Technocrats
ISTANBUL  A simplistic actually naive view of markets is that they exist almost in a tate of nature and that the best of all worlds is one where they are free to operate without government interference
An equally simplistic view of democracy is that it is a political system in which periodic competitive elections give the winner the right to govern without constraint
The reality is far more complex of course
Markets can function only within an institutional and legal framework that includes property rights enforcement of contracts quality and information controls and many other rules to govern transactions
Similarly while competitive elections are essential to any democratic system a innertakeall attitude to electoral outcomes with the victor concentrating power is incompatible with democracy in the long term
Wellfunctioning democracies are embedded in complex constitutional and other laws that separate executive legislative and judicial power and that protect freedom of speech assembly and peaceful dissent by those who lose elections
Regulatory institutions  such as bank supervisory agencies and bodies that oversee the telecommunications food and energy industries  play a vital role by maintaining the alwaysdelicate balance between ree markets and the actions of elected governments and legislatures
The central bank is perhaps the most important of these institutions for it conducts monetary policy and sometimes serves as the financialsector regulator
The policy and regulatory mistakes that contributed to the subprime mortgage crisis  and thus to the US financial system nearmeltdown and the eurozone travails  have brought the issue of optimal economic regulation and its relation to democracy to the fore once again
In the US a significant share of the Republican Party favor abolishing not only the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency but also the Federal Reserve
In their view markets and private initiative require no significant regulation
The role of politics is to elect majorities that can abolish regulations and regulatory bodies
Others around the world similarly oppose regulatory institutions but for very different reasons
They argue that politicians can regulate and supervise without intermediate bodies that have some degree of autonomy
In their minds these bodies merely impede and constrain realization of the people will
If an elected government wants a bank to offer cheap credit to a group of enterprises so that they can hire more people why should a supervisor be able to obstruct this democratic will
If these enterprises are told to hire the governing party supporters as an implicit condition of obtaining subsidized credit that too is the expression of electorally legitimized popular will
At the other end of the spectrum are technocratic superdefenders of regulatory bodies who believe that politicians and electorates are hopelessly confused uneducated and often corrupt
Management of the economy should be entrusted to competent and independent experts a group of latonic Guardians empowered to act in the state higher interests regardless of electoral outcomes or public opinion
The International Monetary Fund the European Commission and the European Central Bank are often viewed as such technocratic institutions  and as supporting the technocratic element within states and societies around the world
At the height of the eurozone crisis the IMF the EC and the ECB not to mention financial markets warmly welcomed the economists Mario Monti and Lucas Papademos as highly respected echnocratic prime ministers for Italy and Greece respectively
Experience in recent decades has shown that a balanced and oderate approach is needed on these matters
Electoral cycles and the accompanying political pressures are such that monetary policy banking and many other areas of policy and economic activity must be overseen by those with professional competence and a much longer time horizon than that of politicians
Daytoday politics cannot dominate the regulation that markets need
The single most important institutional reform underlying price stability throughout the world has been the stronger independence of central banks
But if independent technocrats are allowed to determine longterm policy and set objectives that cannot be influenced by democratic majorities democracy itself is in serious jeopardy
I find it undemocratic for example that the ECB can set the eurozonewide inflation target unilaterally
How much inflation a society finds desirable or tolerable taking into account other important variables such as employment GDP growth or poverty is an inherently political question that should be debated in parliament
The central bank should be consulted but its role should be to implement the objective without political interference independence in terms of policy tools not goals
Globalization and the increasing complexity of financial and other markets make it imperative that the domains of private activity political decisionmaking and regulation be clarified
The challenge is even greater because some regulatory agencies must be multilateral or at least intergovernmental given the global nature of much economic activity
The difference and the distance between markets and politics must be clear and for the sake of both effectiveness and legitimacy it must be based on rules that are well understood and on popular consent
The Transparency Conspiracy
SOFIA  One of the most troubling outcomes of the ongoing financial crisis has been a collapse of trust in democratic institutions and politicians
Indeed in  the global publicrelations firm Edelman rust Barometer survey registered the biggestever decline when it comes to government
Can greater ransparency  the new political mantra of civic activists and an increasing number of democratic governments  reverse this trend
The hope is that a combination of new technologies publicly accessible data and renewed civic engagement can help people control their representatives more effectively
But the idea that transparency will restore public trust in democracy rests on several problematic assumptions primarily the belief that f only people knew everything would be different
Unfortunately matters are not so simple
The end of government secrecy does not mean the birth of the informed citizen nor does more control necessarily suggest more trust in public institutions
For example after American voters learned that President George W Bush had led the United States into a war with Iraq without proof of weapons of mass destruction they reelected him
Likewise Italians kept Silvio Berlusconi in power for more than a decade despite a steady stream of revelations about his wrongdoings
In politics nowing everything still means knowing different things which means that compelling governments to disclose information does not necessarily mean that people learn more or understand better
On the contrary as soon as government information is designed to be immediately open to everybody its value as information declines and its value as an instrument of manipulation increases
Consider how gangsters in crime movies talk when they know that the police are listening
They speak clearly and offer banalities while exchanging notes under the table
That is government in the age of transparency
In his study of truthtelling in ancient Greece the philosopher Michel Foucault pointed out that the act of truthtelling cannot be reduced to citizens learning something that they did not know before
Paradoxically truth in politics is something that everybody knows but that few dare to express
People hardly need additional data to recognize say a rise in inequality or mistreatment of immigrants
The WikiLeaks cables did not teach us anything qualitatively new about America policies
Living in truth cannot be reduced to having access to full information
It is people willingness to take personal risks and confront the powerful by daring to speak the truth not the truth itself that ultimately leads to change
Moreover information never comes without interpretation
Reading the same raw data Republicans and Democrats in the US or secularists and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt will spin it differently because policymaking cannot be divorced from decisionmakers interests and values
As the anthropologists Jean and John Comaroff put it ours s an age in which people almost everywhere seem preoccupied simultaneously with transparency and conspiracy
To see the ambiguity of the politics of trust consider Russia recent experience
In December  the country parliamentary election triggered a civic explosion
Hundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets of Moscow and other big cities to demand a fair vote and real choices in the subsequent presidential election
The escalating crisis of legitimacy forced the government to invent imaginative ways to justify its power
The central proposal was ingenious the Kremlin proposed to guarantee the election fairness by installing webcams at all polling stations every citizen could personally monitor the voting process
As China Xinhua news agency enthusiastically reported rom Kamchatka to Kaliningrad and from Chechnya to Chukotka more than  million net surfers registered to view live streaming from at least  webcams installed in more than  polling stations on Russian territory
In the words of one Finnish observer it was  landmark in the history of democracy and democratic elections
But in a regime like Vladimir Putin where the government decides who may be a candidate the webcams would be farcical were they not also so intimidating
Viewed from the West they were perceived as a tool to keep the government under control by enabling people to watch what it was doing
But from the point of view of a postSoviet voter living in the countryside the webcam sent a different message the government knows how you vote
In a way Putin succeeded twice he looked transparent to the West and menacing to most of his own citizens
The installation of the webcams was an act of simultaneous transparency and conspiracy
The broader issue is transparency advocates insistence that open government can be reconciled with citizens privacy
But might wholly transparent government imply a wholly transparent citizen
As a rule governments monitor people
When that becomes transparent so do those citizens who spoke with or were monitored by the government
Contrary to the expectations of transparency advocates greater disclosure of government information does not make public discourse more rational and less paranoid
If anything it fuels conspiracy theories there is nothing more suspicious than the claim of absolute transparency
Who can honestly say that public debate has become more rational and less paranoid when our governments have become more transparent
Rather than restoring trust in democratic institutions the transparency movement could accelerate the transformation of democratic politics into the management of mistrust
In that case one could imagine the replacement of representative democracy with political regimes that limit citizen control to the executive
None of this is to deny that transparency in government is a worthy goal
But let not fool ourselves by thinking that achieving it will restore citizens faith in their political institutions
The End of Hunger and Malnutrition
ROME  Sometimes something happens that can have a fundamental impact on mankind but passes largely unnoticed at the time
Such an event occurred in December in Rome
The Council of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization decided that the FAO goal should no longer be merely to reduce hunger but to eradicate hunger food insecurity and malnutrition
The next step will be to confirm this change in June  at the FAO Conference in which all FAO member countries participate
To many this small change of wording must seem trivial
Critics will also say that adopting such a goal without setting a target date for achieving it is largely meaningless
Others may claim that even the idea of eradicating hunger is nonsense because we lack the means to do it
For the last  years the Millennium Development Goal of halving hunger by  has been the driving force for hunger reduction
The proportion of hungry people in developing countries has declined significantly  from  in  to  today
However this decrease owes more to a rise in the world population than it does to the slight reduction in the actual number of hungry people from about  million to  million today
A alving goal has only slight political appeal as it implicitly condemns the excluded half to a life on the fringes of society exposed to illness and premature death
Brazil Zero Hunger strategy by contrast has shown that adopting the absolute goal of hunger eradication provides a powerful means of galvanizing government departments into largescale coordinated action and of mobilizing society in a truly national effort to end one of the greatest injustices of our time
To be sure it will be increasingly difficult  though far from impossible  to meet the world growing demand for food and to do this in sustainable ways
Additional food must be produced using technologies that do not damage the natural resources that future generations will need in order to feed themselves that do not fuel climate change which weighs heavily on farmers and that do not accelerate the disintegration of the delicate fabric of rural society
But the challenge may not be as daunting as it seems
The rate of population growth will be much slower than over the past  years and there is much room for reducing the vast quantities of food that are now wasted
Moreover as people incomes rise they might more easily be persuaded to adopt healthier and more environmentally friendly diets than those taken up in the developed world
The double burden of malnutrition  with hunger existing alongside obesity diabetes and other diseases of overconsumption  clearly shows the increasing importance of global dietary rebalancing
There is nothing really new about a commitment to hunger eradication
Indeed the FAO was created in  to bring about a world in which there would be reedom from want which in the words of its founders eans the conquest of hunger and the attainment of the ordinary needs of a decent selfrespecting life
Because of the widespread fear in the postwar years of emerging global food shortages the FAO and the international community as a whole focused mainly on food production  a focus that remained essentially the same in the following decades
Those investments yielded good returns despite staggering global population growth from  billion in  to seven billion today food availability per person has risen by more than 
The problem is that hunger still persists on a vast scale so our focus must now shift to ensuring universal access to adequate food
This should be a top priority for governments and a goal embraced by citizens everywhere
Breaking the vicious cycle of hunger and malnutrition requires complementing the focus on agriculture and rural development more than  of the foodinsecure population lives in rural areas of developing countries with investment in other social and productive programs including modest but predictable financial transfers to the poorest families
With the right policies in place the incremental food demand created by these transfers as well as by school meals programs and nutrition supplements for mothers and infants could create opportunities for smallscale farmers to expand their output and improve their livelihoods
In June UN SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon launched the Zero Hunger Challenge at the Rio Sustainable Development Conference
The FAO has accepted this challenge and is formally setting its sights on hunger eradication
I look forward with confidence to a progressive expansion in the number of member governments that commit themselves to moving as quickly as possible toward ending hunger and malnutrition within their borders  and to helping other countries to achieve the same goal
It is never the wrong moment for the world to set its sights on ending hunger once and for all
Now is the time
The Fatal Myth of a DrugFree World
VIENNA  Negotiations at the United Nations High Level Summit on drugs in Vienna last week fell flat
Although  countries officially stated their support for proven methods such as needle exchange and overdose prevention the summit outcome was a watereddown political declaration that fails to acknowledge crucial lessons that have been learned over the last decade
The refusal to include the words arm reduction seems motivated by ideology rather than science despite clear evidence showing that needle exchange and substitution treatment keep drug users alive and free of deadly infections
Those advocating for harm reduction accept that drugs have always been a part of human history and aim to decrease the damage caused by their production and use
A vocal few disagree with this approach labeling it in the Vatican words ntilife
Those who strive for the futile goal of a rugfree world refuse to recognize the proven benefits of harm reduction
But the evidence against the ar on drugs is overwhelming prisons swelling with nonviolent drug offenders billions of dollars spent on military action to curb production while the availability of illicit drugs increases and prices drop and increasing HIV rates throughout the former Soviet Union and parts of Asia
Elsewhere the stories of futility in the ar on drugs are more brutal capital punishment for drugrelated offenses extrajudicial killings in the name of creating drugfree societies drug users sent to labor camps as a form of reatment and drugusing women handcuffed to beds during childbirth
The list goes on
But there is reason for hope
Since assuming office President Barack Obama has made clear his desire to lift the federal ban on needle exchange in the United States
Indeed while the previous Bush administration led the global opposition to harm reduction the US delegation struck a more conciliatory tone at the Vienna summit indicating what some perceive as a fresh start to drug policy
Ten years ago when a rugfree world became the global drugpolicy mantra no one imagined that in  two million people in the former Soviet Union and over a million in Asia would be infected with HIV through intravenous drug use
Also missing from Vienna was a discussion about increased numbers of destabilized countries becoming narcostates
There is moreover still an important region where drug use has not contributed significantly to HIV infection rates Africa
Sadly when we meet again in ten years this will no longer hold true
Even though no African countries voiced their support in Vienna for harm reduction African leaders should take heed of those countries with pragmatic and humane drug policies
Instead of signaling a new way forward for international drug policy the Vienna declaration represents the same failed politics of the past
Unless that changes quickly the result will be continued suffering and death for millions of people around the world
A Death in Galway
NEW YORK  The case of Savita Halappanavar a yearold dentist from India who had moved with her husband to Ireland continues to reverberate around the world
Halappanavar an expectant mother died after her doctors citing Ireland legal prohibition of abortion refused to remove her weekold fetus despite allegedly acknowledging that the fetus was not viable and placing Halappanavar in an intensivecare unit as her condition deteriorated
Indian activists are outraged
hile there is no single law specific to men that states when where or how medical care should be provided governments enact laws that prescribe confuse and curtail a woman access to safe abortion services Anjali Sen the South Asia director of the International Planned Parenthood Federation pointed out
ight and necessary care could have saved her life
It is inexcusable that doctors instead of undertaking efforts to save her watched her die
Halappanavar suffered extreme pain on October 
She was miscarrying and according to her husband repeatedly asked for a termination after being told that the fetus would not survive
But Halappanavar and her husband were then informed that Ireland is a Catholic country the fetus still had a heartbeat so the procedure was out of the question
Halappanavar died from septicemia which her family is certain would not have developed if the termination had been carried out
Protests in Ireland have put Prime Minister Enda Kenny on the spot with activists there like those in India arguing that Halappanavar died because of a theocratic approach to health care
Irish abortionrights activists point out that legally the life of the fetus does not take precedence over the life of the mother in their country but it does take precedence over the health of the mother  a distinction that American abortion opponents have long sought to replicate in the United States
The Halappanavar case thus reverses the Western stereotype of Eastern societies as preserves of superstition and religious extremism
Halappanavar death resulted from the fanatical atavistic behavior of a Western theocracy while Indian protesters and lawmakers have upheld the scientific rationalist ethos of the Enlightenment
We in the West are so used to ur religious fanatics that we rarely view them as we do the East religious fanatics
But Halappanavar death leaves us with no choice
A nonCatholic slowly being poisoned by a fetus that was no longer viable was asked to accept that care would be withheld from her because the Pope acting on the orders of St Paul was staying the hand of her doctors
One can imagine the furor if a Western nonMuslim woman had died because an Imam had refused her medical care for religious reasons
The fact that the uproar has extended to India illuminates the many ways in which one can view abortion  even from a religious perspective
As I noted almost  years ago the Western ChristianCatholic view of abortion is not the only religious interpretation of the issue
In Hinduism abortion is considered bad karma but that is not the same as the Manichean view defended by fundamentalist Christians and the Catholic Church
Hindu medical ethics calls for ahimsa or onharming that is a doctor duty is to do the least harm possible in the situation
So a Hindu perspective on the Halappanavar case would dictate saving the mother life if the fetus were endangering it
In this respect Hinduism resembles Judaism even Orthodox Judaism in which he mother life is more important than that of the fetus
Abortion while seen in a negative light is not illegal in India probably because it is viewed as an issue of personal morality  one karma shouldering the burden of what we in the West would call hoice
Indeed the abortion problem in India lies at the other end of the spectrum pervasive termination of female fetuses owing to a cultural preference for sons a situation that I would argue inflicts violence against mothers as well
The cultural battle over Halappanavar death is far from settled
Irish women are certainly right to wonder anew if next time it will be they who are endangered by a religious viewpoint that has nothing to do with their medical needs
But it is the outcry in India where protesters are demanding that abortion in Ireland be treated as a private medical decision between a woman and her healthcare providers that may point the way ahead  to a global dialogue about the universal right of women to reproductive health and freedom
Such a global dialogue initiated in he East would not be unique
The growing international demand for the rule of law and human rights was on display recently when Afghan lawmakers tried  futilely but honorably  to explain the principles of the US Constitution to occupying Americans who had sought to establish a system of detention without due process
It is healthy when the West is asked to live up to its own selfimage as the bastion of reason and human liberty
Facing up to its own lapses into fanaticism or barbarity would be a good place to start
The Vision and the Fantasy
JERUSALEM  Israel an audacious vision that came true is now celebrating its th anniversary with a sense of welldeserved satisfaction at its extraordinary domestic achievements
In its relations with the outside world however the Jewish state still has a long way to go
Historically the Jewish experience in international relations has not been particularly edifying
A Jewish state has existed for only short periods in Judaism history and it twice committed political suicide
The reasons were always the same politicoreligious fanaticism and the blunder of challenging the prevailing world powers  hence modern Zionism obsessive quest for a binding alliance with a superpower
Ethnocentrism is bound to distort a people relations with the rest of the world and Israel doctrine of power was drawn from the depths of Jewish experience particularly the eternal unforgiving hostility of a Gentile world
The role of the Holocaust as the constituent myth of the Zionist metanarrative reinforced Israel tendency to face he world an amorphous but imposing construct with which the Jews wage a dispute that cannot be resolved through the traditional tools of international relations
It was through Zionism an essentially secular nationalist movement that the Jews were returned to political action and developed the necessary diplomatic tools
But while early Zionism was blessed with pragmatism and diplomatic savoirfaire the preponderance of the military ethos of the nation in arms has relegated Zionism extraordinary foreignpolicy achievements to a remote corner of Israelis collective memory
A crucial moment in the history of Israel oscillation between diplomatic and military ctivism took place on the eve of the  war
That crossroads exposed a deep cleavage between the young selfconfident Israeliborn generals who were spiteful of the older generation ubmissive attitude and the Diasporaborn politicians who haunted by Holocaust memories and existentially fearful of international isolation resisted making a break with the old politics of diplomatic Zionism
The pragmatic wisdom of early Zionism is easily explained in contrast to the antiSemitic clich about ewish power Zionism was the national movement of a weak people decimated by oppression and genocide  a people that might face annihilation if it made the wrong choice at a moment of decision
Admittedly the Zionist leaders never really abandoned wider territorial dreams but they would never have considered delaying the establishment of the Jewish state for the sole reason that it would not have access to the Western Wall or the Temple Mount
The positive ethos of building a new society was supposed to compensate for the poverty of the territorial solution
The  war however represented an ominous watershed
Israel lightning victory recalls Hegel dictum about he impotence of the winners
Military victories are never final and definitive
In  in a famous open letter entitled he Homeland Is in Danger the historian Jacob Talmon tried to share this simple lesson with Prime Minister Menachem Begin
Talmon criticized the Israeli right belief that one major ventould radically and permanently change the situation in Israel favor and he repudiated the eligious sanction used to justify unrealistic policies in the Occupied Territories
He explained the Messianic illusions that were reborn with the SixDay War as false compensation for the martyrdom of the Shoah
There was nothing mysterious about Israel victory he claimed it was the result of a simple concatenation of circumstances
A small country like Israel lacking a serious demographic foundation or favorable geopolitical conditions could never perpetuate its presence in occupied territories Talmon argued
Hence the danger to Israel lay in the Sisyphean effort to subjugate the Palestinians
lind is the leader who does not see that a war of races is what lies ahead he wrote
Israel annexationist right would dismiss its efeatist detractors with the claim that the entire Zionist enterprise was an unrealistic dream that miraculously came true
In fact Israel materialized because historical and political conditions favored it and because Zionist diplomacy successfully navigated the internationalrelations challenges that it encountered
But the victory of June  was not a license for Israel to set utterly unrealistic objectives for itself
Not every fantasy is a vision
The ethos of Israel far right consists in its insistence on blurring this distinction
The right fatalism about the chances of peace is a useless adviser in foreign policy
Political positions are not eternal they are always susceptible to change
Nor is it true that nothing can sway the Arab world from its hostility to Israel
The Arabs might never accept the moral justice of Zionism but as the Arab Peace Initiative indicates they would consider accepting the political legitimacy of a Jewish state
Not even Israel staunchest allies will risk an indefinite confrontation with the entire international community by supporting Israel territorial ambitions
Reasonable border modifications are one thing legitimizing a Jewish empire is quite another
Indeed international acquiescence to the situation created by Israel victory in  proved to be extremely shortlived
When a war of salvation and survival turned into a war of conquest occupation and annexation the international community recoiled and Israel went on the defensive
It has remained there ever since
The Fear Factor in USChina Relations
Opinion polls indicate that onethird of Americans believe that China will oon dominate the world while nearly half view China emergence as a hreat to world peace
In turn many Chinese fear that the United States will not accept their eaceful rise
Americans and Chinese must avoid such exaggerated fears
Maintaining good USChina relations will be a key determinant of global stability in this century
Perhaps the greatest threat to the bilateral relationship is the belief that conflict is inevitable
Throughout history whenever a rising power creates fear among its neighbors and other great powers that fear becomes a cause of conflict
In such circumstances seemingly small events can trigger an unforeseen and disastrous chain reaction
Today the greatest prospect of a destabilizing incident lies in the complex relationships across the Taiwan Strait
China which regards Taiwan as an integral part of its territory that has sheltered behind the US navy since the days of the Chinese civil war vows that any Taiwanese declaration of independence will be met by force
The US does not challenge China sovereignty but it wants a peaceful settlement that will maintain Taiwan democratic institutions
In Taiwan itself there is a growing sense of national identity but a sharp division between pragmatists of the anblue alliance who realize that geography will require them to find a compromise with the mainland and the ruling angreen alliance which aspires in varying degrees to achieve independence
The two sides in Taiwan will face off in a presidential election on March 
Current polls suggest that former Taipei Mayor Ma Yingjeou of the Kuomintang KMT leads Frank Hsieh of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party DPP
But some observers fear that the incumbent DPP President Chen Shuibian will seek a pretext to prevent a defeat for the prosovereignty camp
He is currently advocating a referendum on whether Taiwan should join the United Nations which China views as provocative
Chen replies that it is China hat is acting provocatively today
America is clearly concerned
Recently US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told a news conference that e think that Taiwan referendum to apply to the UN under the name aiwan is a provocative policy
It unnecessarily raises tensions in the Taiwan Strait and it promises no real benefits for the people of Taiwan on the international stage
She also reiterated the administration policy opposing nilateral threat by either side to change the status quo
The same day Secretary of Defense Robert Gates criticized China for unexpectedly curtailing American ship visits to Chinese ports because of American arms sales to Taiwan
According to Gates he had told Chinese officials that American arms sales were consistent with past policy and that s long as they continued to build up their forces on their side of the Taiwan Strait we would continue to give Taiwan the resources necessary to defend itself
Gates added however that despite China rising defense budget  don consider China an enemy and I think there are opportunities for continued cooperation in a number of areas
In principle the Taiwan issue need not lead to conflict
With increasing change in China and growing economic and social contacts across the strait it should be possible to find a formula that allows the Taiwanese to maintain their market economy and democratic system without a placard at the UN
Thus far the US has tried to allow for this evolution by stressing two bright lines no independence for Taiwan and no use of force by China
But given the danger of incidents that could grow out of political competition in Taiwan or growing impatience in the Peoples Liberation Army on the mainland the US would be wise to encourage more active contacts and negotiations by the two sides
The US has a broad national interest in maintaining good relations with China as well as a specific human rights interest in protecting Taiwan democracy
The US does not have a national interest in helping Taiwan become a sovereign country with a seat at the UN and efforts by some Taiwanese to do so present the greatest danger of a miscalculation that could create enmity between the US and China
Already some Chinese suspect the US of seeking an independent Taiwan as an nsinkable aircraft carrier for use against a future Chinese enemy
They are wrong but such suspicions can feed a climate of enmity
If America treats China as an enemy today it will ensure future enmity
While we cannot be sure how China will evolve it makes no sense to foreclose the prospect of a better future
America current policy combines economic integration with a hedge against future uncertainty
The USJapan security alliance means China cannot play a apan card
But while such hedging is natural in world politics modesty is important for both sides
If the overall climate is one of distrust what looks like a hedge to one side can look like a threat to the other
There is no need for the US and China to go to war in this century
Both sides must take care that an incident concerning Taiwan does not lead in that direction
Americans and Chinese must avoid letting exaggerated fears create a selffulfilling prophecy
The Fear Factor
LOS ANGELES  The debate over fiscal expansion versus consolidation continues to divide the developed world
In response to the global recession of  the United Kingdom embarked on an austerity program while the United States enacted an  billion fiscal stimulus
Despite a softening economy British Prime Minister David Cameron is promising to stay the austerity course
Obama too is sticking to his guns with his recent proposal for an additional  billion of government expenditure and tax cuts to help boost employment
Unemployment in the US has remained above  for  of the last  months
While some are supporting additional stimulus others are calling for UKstyle austerity
But would either of these approaches reduce unemployment most effectively or would a new round of uantitative easing an unconventional form of economic stimulus by which the central bank purchases financial assets work better
With Nobel prizewinning economists on both sides of the current debate about how to solve the unemployment problem the public is rightly confused
Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz are calling for an even larger fiscal stimulus to target government spending on education and infrastructure investment
On the other side Robert Mundell Myron Scholes and Reinhard Selten have called for raconian measures to tame debt levels
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ARRA that Obama passed barely three weeks after his inauguration was disappointing
An  billion stimulus did not have the effect for which its proponents hoped largely because it was accompanied by a big increase in private savings
Backers of the stimulus plan now claim that things would have been much worse without ARRA
I am skeptical
A better approach to reducing unemployment would be a new and expanded round of quantitative easing
I am heartened by calls for this in the UK and that the talk is now turning to the purchase of risky assets such as corporate bonds or bundles of loans to the private sector as opposed to longterm government securities
This is a step in the right direction that I have been advocating for the past three years
But I would go even further
My work provides a new and coherent approach to macroeconomics that explains how a lack of confidence can lead to persistent unemployment
It supports the purchase of equities by central banks to reduce assetprice volatility restore the value of wealth and prevent a future market crash
When businessmen and women are afraid they stop investing in real assets
Lack of confidence is reflected in low and volatile asset values
The environment of fear that arises has little to do with bad government policies although bad policy may exacerbate the situation
Businessmen and women become afraid that stocks and the values of the machines and factories that back those stocks may fall further
Fear feeds on itself and the prediction that stocks will lose value becomes selffulfilling
The  recession was triggered by the collapse of a realestate bubble
Housing wealth in the US has fallen by  since its peak in  and is still declining
The stock market fell by almost  from its  peak and remains down by nearly a third
This enormous loss of wealth caused a large and persistent drop in consumption demand which has led to an increase in unemployment
Until we are willing to explore new solutions the misery experienced by millions of unemployed workers will continue
A quantitativeeasing policy in which a central bank buys risky assets can prevent price fluctuations and restore the value of financial wealth
These purchases would need Treasury support since this tactic is in effect a fiscal policy not a monetary policy
And by involving the Treasury the purchase of risky assets could be financed by issuing debt rather than by printing more money thereby attenuating inflationary fears
The Great Recession did not turn into Great Depression II because of coordinated action by governments around the world
Although fiscal expansion may have played a role in this success central bank intervention was the most important component by far
Quantitative easing works by increasing the value of wealth
In both the US and the UK it reduced the real expected return on longterm government bonds which in turn nurtured a recovery in the stock market
We need not tolerate  unemployment as the new normal
Confidence is a selffulfilling prophecy and we can and should manage it by direct intervention in asset markets
The way ahead leads through science not ideology dogma or failed theories
The Fear Profiteers
OXFORD  Just when it seemed that America omeland Security state could not get more surreal the United States Transportation Security Administration has rolled out a costly Scylla and Charybdis at major airports either you accept dangerous doses of radiation and highresolution imaging of your naked body or worried about the health risks of cumulative radiation you opt out of the new fullbody xray machines rapidly dubbed ornoscanners
But if you opt out you are now subjected as I was last week to an extraordinarily sexualized and invasive atdown by TSA officials
 will now touch your private parts a very uncomfortable female TSA official said to me when I flew out of New York Kennedy Airport
And sure enough I experienced the invasive touching of genitals and breasts that is now standard policy for US travelers
Men report handling of their testicles and penises TSA officials are instructed to open and peer down waistbands and YouTube is now rife with videos of frightened children being  to describe it accurately  sexually molested though this is the last thing most TSA officials wish to do
Are we free not to be radiated or groped
We are not
Passengers who have refused to be patted down on their genitals have been handcuffed to chairs
Each new terror alert or hightech innovation it seems makes new demands on our liberty in the name of security
But travelers recent experiences in the US should give security officials elsewhere good reason to avoid implementing similar policies
In fact America bizarre new policy is likely to remain unique among airports in the industrialized countries if not the entire world
Israeli security officials for example scoff at genital patdowns which they say accomplish nothing
That is not exactly true
Twentyfour per cent of women have been sexually assaulted or molested by a trusted adult in childhood or adolescence  as have  of men
Many of these survivors willbe retraumatized when strangers grope their genitals
And children will be placed most at risk of profound negative effects
Years of sensitive educational outreach have finally made it the norm for American children to understand that their bodies are their own that adults should not touch them intimately or in ways that make them uncomfortable and that they can expect to be protected from such violation
By desensitizing children to sexually inappropriate touching the patdowns are destroying those hardwon gains
It gets worse
TSA officials have been advised to tell small children that the sexual patdowns are a game
To anyone who has ever counseled survivors of childhood sexual abuse this should set off alarm bellsthe most common ploy of sexual predators is to portray the abuse as a ame
As Ken Wooden of the organization Child Lures Prevention puts it the TSA ncredibly misinformed and misguided advice s completely contrary to what we in the sexualabuse prevention field have been trying to accomplish for the past  years
Americans for once are fighting back against this latest violation of their rights
Two states New Jersey and Idaho recently introduced legislation to seek to opt out of the new policy
Questions about the change in practice have reached US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton  who admitted that she herself would resist a sexual patdown  and President Barack Obama
So what led to a policy that is appalling to citizens damaging to children and ineffective for improving our security
Welcome to America current reality in which threats are hyped so that a handful of insiders can make a killing
Shortly after former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff made the rounds of TV shows arguing in favor of such measures to thwart ad guys one of his consulting firm clients Rapiscan won the  million contract to provide the fullbody xray machines
As one TSA supervisor said to me after my own sexualized patdown his is about bureaucracy  people trying to cover their asses  and there is a ton of money involved as well
Meanwhile the supervisor confirmed  as has online discussion by TSA employees  that workers ordered to molest travelers are traumatized too
One army veteran said that he cries every day from the resistance and outcry he now faces from passengers and that the stress is worse than being on active military deployment
Others say they feel degraded and ashamed
Indeed TSA workers are now working in a sexually hostile environment which is illegal
Finally one must ask is there a psychological element to the US requirement of submission to genital groping by uniformed officials
It is impossible to forget the many strange sexual twists of Bush administration policies from forced nudity of prisoners  which postAbu Ghraib records show was systemic not an aberration  to the sexual threats and sexual assaults against such prisoners the sexualized hazing rituals and accounts of rape practiced with impunity by contractors and so on
I am not suggesting that sexually degrading practices are a conscious part of the TSA new policy
But the history of closing societies shows that nudity and forced or degrading sexualized practices become consciously or unconsciously part of the states consolidation of power
It is not too extreme to put this into context billions of dollars in profit now depend on insiders like Chertoff maintaining US society in a state of overhyped alert that demands increasingly costly technology
Maintaining these profits requires a population conditioned by this theater of fear to submit to anything  even the sexual quasiabuse of themselves and their children
The Triumph of Fear
PARIS  In May  Pope John Paul II survived an assassination attempt
Thirty years later Osama bin Laden was killed by United States Special Forces
But looking at the world now one could easily conclude that the inspirational leader whose credo was Franklin Roosevelt injunction to fear only ear itself has lost and that the fanatic who wanted fear to dominate the world of the nfidels has prevailed
Today fear is ubiquitous and the bombings at the Boston Marathon must be understood in that context for the attack both highlights and deepens our pervasive sense of insecurity
The scale of the Boston attack was of course much smaller than that of September  
But Americans will remember this homegrown plot as a highly symbolic moment an attack on a venerable international sporting event on Patriots Day
The marathon is a cherished event for it reflects the peaceful values of a democratic society that seeks to transcend its challenges through sheer endurance
Will an attack on such a symbol reinforce the prevalence of fear in an American society that was once defined by hope
Fear of terrorism is only one segment of what might best be described as a multilevel structure of dread
Domestically there is fear of pontaneous massacres like the slaughter in December of schoolchildren in Newtown Connecticut
Internationally there is fear of civil wars in the Arab world of social unrest in crisisridden Europe and of war in Asia resulting from North Korea brinkmanship or the irresponsible escalation of territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas
And then there are global fears linked to climate change epidemics cyber wars and more
The list seems endless
Revisiting my  book The Geopolitics of Emotion How Cultures of Fear Humiliation and Hope are reshaping the World it seems clear that fear has gained the upper hand
Does this mean that a fearful West has prevailed once again
And is fear in the rest of the world a response to the West strength or to its new weakness
Either way the West has now spread its negative emotions after having once imposed its mostly materialist values on the rest of the world
It is of course too early to say whether this is a sign of deep change or merely a passing trend and reality is no doubt much less simple
But to distill the essence of today mood one could say that fear is the direct result of the process of globalization the world is not necessarily flat but it definitely feels smaller and thers appear more menacing than ever
In the aftermath of World War II a group of idealistic Frenchmen bent on reconciliation with their former enemy declared that France would have he Germany she deserved
That is German behavior would be a function of how France behaved toward its defeated neighbor
In the same vein we will have the ther we deserve
If our behavior is based on fear we will look with suspicion on all those who are different from us deepening the alienation of the millions inside and outside our countries who believe that they cannot integrate into even the most open societies
Their response could in turn call into question that very openness
Of course in today interdependent and transparent world no society can protect itself fully
There is no isolation from globalized markets your neighbors identity crises or the humiliation felt by those you have tried with so much at times misguided energy to integrate
The simultaneity of unmanageable uncertainties  the crux of globalization itself  may lure some into seeking to reverse a process that has become inescapable and over which no one has control
Given that all alternatives to globalization are unrealistic frightening or both how can we sublimate transcend or at least channel our fears
Can Western societies remain what they are or at least should be  open tolerant and respectful of difference  while responding to demands for greater protection against the multifaceted threats whether imagined or real that we face
How we answer these questions will in large part determine whether in a relentlessly globalizing world fear has the last word
The Fed Scylla and Charybdis
TILBURG  While the advanced economies have been struggling through the worst economic crisis in decades their central banks have had it easy
After all when faced with falling GDP growth a financial system on the verge of collapse plummeting realestate prices and a lack of consumer confidence the needed monetarypolicy response is clear keep lowering nominal interest rates until they reach the zero bound then pull out the big unconventional guns
But for the US Federal Reserve the easy part is over
When the Fed launched its first round of quantitative easing QE  largescale purchases of longterm financial assets  in  policymakers declared that the goal was to kickstart the US economy
Once that was achieved the Fed vowed it would terminate the scheme
Now with the US economy growing at a steady annual rate of roughly  realestate prices rising consumer confidence at a sixyear high and gradual recovery in the labor market the time has come for the Fed to follow through on its promise
To be sure the US economy is not performing at precrisis levels
But recent developments herald the ostcrisis era  and that means that QE objective has been fulfilled
To use former Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin metaphor the party has gotten going again so the Fed must take away the punch bowl
But this is easier said than done given that America government financial markets and consumers have become addicted to rockbottom interest rates
As a result just as Odysseus was forced to choose between facing Scylla a sixheaded monster and Charybdis a deadly whirlpool in Homer Odyssey the Fed must take action knowing that whichever course it chooses could have serious adverse consequences  and thus will probably be considered the wrong move
If the Fed keeps its word and begins to formulate an exit strategy it risks derailing the recovery
The normalization of monetary policy will lead to the normalization of longterm interest rates bringing the nominal interest rate on US tenyear government bonds to at least 
Given this as soon as the Fed begins to withdraw from QE it can expect pressure from Congress the White House consumers and companies to intensify considerably
Worse financial markets anticipating that a slower recovery will impair America ability to finance its budget deficit could demand a risk premium on US government debt forcing policymakers to revive the contentious debtceiling debate
This is the Fed Scylla
The alternative would be for the Fed to decide  whether on its own or in response to external pressure  that it is too soon to initiate an exit from QE
But more QE would fuel inflation expectations pushing up longterm interest rates
Meet the Fed Charybdis
In theory the Fed could try to navigate between the two hazards by using orward guidance  that is by signaling to financial markets well in advance how and when it will initiate its policy change
But this route is likely to be too narrow to avoid both threats successfully especially given the complex nature of a QE exit
Indeed forward guidance works well in areas  like inflation targeting  that depend on only one indicator
By contrast an exit from QE must account for many factors including GDP growth inflation and unemployment
As a result the time frame and exit route would be subject to change with each new set of macroeconomic data  rendering the very concept of forward guidance useless
In fact the approach could even exacerbate market uncertainty 
The Fed has a difficult decision to make  one that involves significant risk
And sooner or later other advancedcountry central banks will face a similar dilemma
Far from being over the crisis is entering a new and dangerous phase
The Fed vs the Financiers
In his August  address to the world most influential annual monetary policy conference in Jackson Hole Wyoming United States Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke coolly explained why the Fed is determined to resist pressure to stabilize swooning equity and housing prices
Bernanke principled position  echoed by European Central Bank head Jean Claude Trichet and Bank of England head Mervyn King  has set off a storm in markets accustomed to the attentive pampering lavished on them by Bernanke predecessor Alan Greenspan
This is certainly highstakes poker with huge sums hanging in the balance in the  trillion global financial market
Investors who viewed Greenspan as a warm security blanket now lavish him with fat sixfigure speaking fees
But who is right Bernanke or Greenspan
Central bankers or markets
A bit of intellectual history is helpful in putting today debate in context
Bernanke who took over at the Fed in  launched his policy career in  with a brilliant paper presented to the same Jackson Hole conference
As an academic Bernanke argued that central banks should be wary of secondguessing massive global securities markets
They should ignore fluctuations in equity and housing prices unless there is clear and compelling evidence of dangerous feedback into output and inflation
Greenspan listened patiently and quietly to Bernanke logic
But Greenspan memoirs to be published later this month will no doubt strongly defend his famous decisions to bail out financial markets with sharp interest rate cuts in   and  arguing that the world might have fallen apart otherwise
On the surface Bernanke view seems intellectually unassailable
Central bankers cannot explain equity or housing prices and their movements any better than investors can
And Bernanke knows as well as anyone that none of the vast academic literature suggests a large role for asset prices in setting monetary policy except in the face of extraordinary shocks that influence output and inflation such as the Great Depression of the 
In short no central banker can be the Oracle of Delphi
Indeed many academic economists believe that central bankers could perfectly well be replaced with a computer programmed to implement a simple rule that adjusts interest rates mechanically in response to output and inflation
But while Bernanke view is theoretically rigorous reality is not
One problem is that academic models assume that central banks actually know what output and inflation are in real time
In fact central banks typically only have very fuzzy measures
Just a month ago for example the US statistical authorities significantly downgraded their estimate of national output for 
The problem is worse in most other countries
Brazil for example uses visits to doctors to measure healthsector output regardless of what happens to the patient
China statistical agency is still mired in communist inputoutput accounting
Even inflation can be very hard to measure precisely
What can price stability possibly mean in an era when new goods and services are constantly being introduced and at a faster rate than ever before
US statisticians have tried to ix the consumer price index to account for new products but many experts believe that measured US inflation is still at least one percentage point too high and the margin of error can be more volatile than conventional CPI inflation itself
So while monetary policy can in theory be automated as computer programmers say arbage in garbage out
Stock and housing prices may be volatile but the data are much cleaner and timelier than anything available for output and inflation
This is why central bankers must think about the information embedded in asset prices
In fact this summer asset price correction reinforced a view many of us already had that the US economy was slowing led by sagging productivity and a deteriorating housing market
I foresee a series of interest rate cuts by the Fed which should not be viewed as a concession to asset markets but rather as recognition that the real economy needs help
In a sense a central bank relationship with asset markets is like that of a man who claims he is going to the ballet to make himself happy not to make his wife happy
But then he sheepishly adds that if his wife is not happy he cannot be happy
Perhaps Bernanke will soon come to feel the same way now that his honeymoon as Fed chairman is over
The Federal Government Races to the Cliff
In the  movie Rebel Without a Cause James Dean and a teenage rival race two cars to the edge of a cliff in a game of chicken Both intend to jump out at the last moment But the other guy miscalculates and goes over the cliff with the car
This is the game that is being played out in Washington this month over the debt ceiling The chance is at least  that the result will be similarly disastrous
It is amazing that the financial markets continue to view the standoff with equanimity Interest rates on US treasury bonds remain very low  at the tenyear maturity Evidently it is still considered a sign of sophistication to say his is just politics as usual They will come to an agreement in the end
Probably they will But maybe not
I put a  probability on an agreement that raises the debt limit but just muddles through in terms of the genuine long term fiscal problem That leaves at most a  probability of a genuine longterm solution of the sort that President Obama apparently proposed last week  described as worth  trillion over ten years
My advice to investors is to shift immediately out of US treasuries and into highrated corporate bonds If the worst happens you will probably save yourself from a big capital loss within the next month If not there is no harm done
The game is not symmetric The Republicans are the ones who are miscalculating Evidently they are confident of prevailing they rejected the President offer even though he was willing to cut entitlement programs
The situation is complicated because there are a number of different people crammed into the Republican car There is one guy who is obsessed with the theory that come August  the federal government could retain its top credit rating if it continued to service its debt by ceasing payment on its other bills But this would mean failing to honor legal obligations that have already been incurred paying suppliers for paper clips that have already been bought paying soldiers their wages for last month service sending social security recipients their checks etc This is like observing that the cliff is not a  degree dropoff but only  degrees It doesn matter the car would still go crashing into the ocean far below The government credit would still be downgraded and global investors would still demand higher interest rates to hold US treasuries probably on a longterm basis
There are other guys and gals in the car who are even more delusional They are dead set on a policy of immediately eliminating the budget deficit eg those opposed to raising the debt ceiling no matter what or those campaigning for a balanced budget amendment and doing it primarily by cutting nondefense discretionary spending This is literally impossible arithmetically But they honestly don know this It is as if they were insisting that the car can fly Sometimes it can be a good bargaining position to adopt a very extreme position But if you are demanding that the car flies you are not going to get your way no matter how determined you are
It seems likely that the man in the driver seat  House Speaker John Boehner  does realize that his fellow passengers don have the facts quite right But there is also a game of chicken going on within the Republican car The crazies have said they will oppose in the next Republican primary election any congressman who votes to raise the debt ceiling or to raise tax revenues
Yes they think they would support someone who would eliminate the budget deficit primarily by cutting nondefense discretionary spending but remember this is arithmetically impossible
The guy who is riding shotgun in the car  the one who believes the car can fly  is trying to put his foot on top of Boehner on the accelerator pedal
It seems to me that Boehner too is miscalculating Given that the car can fly the crazy guy is probably going to oppose him in the primaries no matter what he does So I don see what his plan is But whatever it is he has made it clear that he doesn plan to agree to any increase in tax revenues
As a result the Republican leadership is in the remarkable situation of refusing to agree to Obama offer to solve the problem so long as the solution includes raising tax revenue even if it is via such measures as ending distortionary subsidies for ethanol oil companies and corporate jets
If I had to guess The financial markets will wake up just before August  US bond prices will finally fall The market reaction will shock the Republican leadership into action
Precedents include the delayed congressional passage of the unpopular TARP legislation in the fall of  and the delayed passage of an unpopular IMF quota increase  years earlier
They will finally make the small but necessary concessions on tax revenues But by then it might be too late
The Federal Reserve Diet
LONDON  Markets around the world were relieved by the US Senate confirmation of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke reappointment
It was the right decision from the perspective of financial stability change at the top would have thrown in doubt the Fed determination to respond decisively to the crisis  and indeed its longterm commitment to low inflation
Bernanke performance over the last two years has won high praise and an extended political fight over control of US monetary policy was the last thing the world needed at what is still a very delicate moment for the global economy
Nevertheless  senators voted against Bernanke
This may in part have just been partisan politics but Bernanke was appointed by President George W Bush and there were other voices both Democrat and independent raised against his reappointment
The case against Bernanke rested partly on his performance before the crisis
Was he not a hardcore member of the reenspan consensus which held that it was not the Fed responsibility to look out for bubbles whether of asset prices or credit and that it should limit itself to mopping up after the event
Bernanke had also supported the lowinterestrate policy implemented after the dotcom collapse which in the view of many economists was maintained for too long fueling the boom and contributing to the bust
Indeed just recently he defended that policy whereas many other central bankers have tacitly or explicitly accepted that they need a new approach to credit and asset prices
That was I think part of the reason for many commentators doubts about Bernanke continued suitability
But these arguments became tangled up in a broader critique of the Fed actions
Should it have been allowed to rescue the insurance giant AIG so expensively without approval by the US Congress
How is it that the Fed balance sheet can expand so dramatically potentially committing large sums of taxpayer dollars without Congress having a purchase on its decisions except well after the event
These questions have led to pressure for audits of the Fed actions and for greater political control over its decisionmaking
Congressman Ron Paul has been leading the pack hunting the Fed but he is by no means as isolated a voice as he was two years ago
This is dangerous territory
Any suggestion that monetarypolicy decisions would in future be subject to political override would to use a nontechnical term spook the markets
Most developed countries have concluded that centralbank independence makes good sense
Politicians acknowledge in their more rational moments yes they have them that they can be trusted with the interestrate weapon especially as an election approaches
So they have handed it over to technocrats in the hope that they make rational choices that benefit everyone
I share this consensus view
But there is a problem and the crisis has highlighted it
The arguments that apply strongly in the case of interest rates are less clear when it comes to other functions that central banks may carry
If a central bank is committing public funds in support of individual firms even with a systemic justification do not different accountability considerations apply
And if it is a direct institutional supervisor as well as being the lender of last resort there are different considerations again
Supervisors make decisions that in effect have an impact on private financial returns and property rights
They must operate within tight legal constraints and with rigorous accountability frameworks involving the government and the legislature
In its proposed reforms of the regulatory system the Obama administration plans to give the Fed more of these powers
That has inevitably strengthened the hands of those who argue that more power requires more accountability
The problem is how to establish two different types of accountability for two different functions
Is it possible to maintain a rigorously independent chairman when it comes to interest rates and a tightly accountable chairman when he is making supervisory decisions
Only with great difficulty is my answer
It is very hard to make legislators understand these delicate distinctions
There is bound to be some contagion from one function to another
So the proposals to strengthen the Fed regulatory role carry great risks
It would be far better in my view to leave the Fed with an overall systemic role which raises fewer new accountability issues
Below it there is the opportunity to create a single banking supervisor combining the functions of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency the Office of Thrift Supervision and the regulatory functions of the regional Feds
In a perfect world one would add in the state banking regulators but I recognize that at this point I have begun to trample on cherished features of the US Constitution
This regulatory architecture would leave the Fed free to speak openly about the development of the financial system as a whole without worrying about the implications for individual institutions in its care
The crisis has demonstrated that we need this plain speaking
Moreover such a solution would protect the Fed crucial independence in its monetarypolicy role
President Obama should not draw the conclusion that arguments about the Fed accountability have gone away with Bernanke confirmation
If he proceeds with plans to give it more functions they will persist
To protect the Fed independence which is a global public good of the highest importance he should cut back the Fed authority to its core role
The Greenspan Temptation
WASHINGTON DC  The drafters of the United States Constitution had to make a fundamental choice Should they concentrate power in the hands of one man or devise a political system in which decisionmaking influence would be more diffuse
A similar choice now faces US President Barack Obama as he considers who should succeed Ben Bernanke as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
Bernanke legacy is decidedly mixed but its most appealing feature is the ethos of collegiality and shared responsibility that he encouraged at the Fed
Indeed a key goal for his successor should be to cement this approach as a new institutional tradition
Yet a strong inclination toward an allpowerful Fed chairman is apparent both from history and from trial balloons recently floated by the Obama administration
The Federal Reserve Board comprises seven governors but for most of its history the Board has operated in the shadow of its chairmen three of whom Marriner Eccles William McChesney Martin and most recently Alan Greenspan served for nearly  years
Monetary policy is in principle decided by the Federal Open Market Committee which includes  voting members the seven Fed governors the president of the New York Fed and four presidents of the other  regional Federal Reserve Banks who serve on a oneyear rotating basis
In practice however Greenspan and many of his predecessors came to dominate the FOMC
What wrong with an omnipotent Fed chairman
Start by considering the lasting impact of Greenspan who believed deeply that financial deregulation would contribute to more stable economic growth
As he put it in  s we move into a new century the marketstabilizing private regulatory forces should gradually displace many cumbersome increasingly ineffective government structures
Greenspan left office in  but the crisis that soon followed can be attributed in large part to the kind of financial innovation that he encouraged
By  in congressional testimony Greenspan was willing to concede a fatal flaw in his thinking  deregulated financial markets can indeed go badly wrong
In a situation that demands fast and bold decisionmaking someone has to be in charge
The Continental Congress did well when in  it asked George Washington to lead the forces then gathering in rebellion against the British
But Washington in turn was wise to decline authoritarian powers following independence  and again when he resigned after eight years as the new country first president
The modern financial world is fastmoving and complex
The next chairman will have to move decisively to persuade colleagues when needed but first and foremost he or she will need a heavy dose of humility and respect for the views of his or her peers
Monetary policy involves a significant amount of art as well as some science
And our understanding of acroprudential regulation and how that affects financial stability is still at a very early stage
The consequences of poorly understood interconnections among countries have repeatedly blindsided the world major central banks  consider the euro crisis or European banks heavy reliance on financing from USbased moneymarket funds
The next Fed chairman should be someone with an open mind a willingness to engage the staff and a desire to cultivate expertise throughout the Federal Reserve System
The worst possible outcome would be to pick someone who shares Greenspan inclinations  holding data tightly monopolizing decisionmaking and attempting to overawe colleagues
A year tenure for such a person would be a recipe for economic disaster which would no doubt begin with some form of financial crisis
But that would not be the worst of the danger
There would also be insistent calls for curtailing the Federal Reserve powers or limiting its independence from Congress
Countries have experimented with allowing politicians to control monetary policy on a daytoday basis
It never ends well  politicians simply find it too tempting to juice the economy in the runup to an election or at other politically important moments
Rather than playing with fire by proposing a Fed chairman who would aspire to become a dominant figure perhaps the Obama administration should consider a term limit on the Fed chairman say eight years
Term limits improve governance in some other official US agencies and elsewhere
The problem is that once reform of the Fed is on the table all kinds of other ideas will surface
The randomness of the political process could easily produce outcomes that reduce its independence
That is why the Fed chairman leadership style is so important
Ben Bernanke made mistakes  including thinking too much like Greenspan in the runup to the catastrophe of 
But he also established the rudiments of a more collegial and balanced decisionmaking process within the Fed
His successor should be chosen with the goal of building on this achievement

The Trapdoors at the Fed Exit
MUMBAI  The ongoing weakness of America economy  where deleveraging in the private and public sectors continues apace  has led to stubbornly high unemployment and subpar growth
The effects of fiscal austerity  a sharp rise in taxes and a sharp fall in government spending since the beginning of the year  are undermining economic performance even more
Indeed recent data have effectively silenced hints by some Federal Reserve officials that the Fed should begin exiting from its current third and indefinite round of quantitative easing QE
Given slow growth high unemployment which has fallen only because discouraged workers are leaving the labor force and inflation well below the Fed target this is no time to start constraining liquidity
The problem is that the Fed liquidity injections are not creating credit for the real economy but rather boosting leverage and risktaking in financial markets
The issuance of risky junk bonds under loose covenants and with excessively low interest rates is increasing the stock market is reaching new highs despite the growth slowdown and money is flowing to highyielding emerging markets
Even the periphery of the eurozone is benefiting from the wall of liquidity unleashed by the Fed the Bank of Japan and other major central banks
With interest rates on government bonds in the US Japan the United Kingdom Germany and Switzerland at ridiculously low levels investors are on a global quest for yield
It may be too soon to say that many risky assets have reached bubble levels and that leverage and risktaking in financial markets is becoming excessive
But the reality is that credit and assetequity bubbles are likely to form in the next two years owing to loose US monetary policy
The Fed has signaled that QE will continue until the labor market has improved sufficiently likely in early  with the interest rate at  until unemployment has fallen at least to  most likely no earlier than the beginning of 
Even when the Fed starts to raise interest rates some time in  it will proceed slowly
In the previous tightening cycle which began in  it took the Fed two years to normalize the policy rate
This time the unemployment rate and household and government debt are much higher
Rapid normalization  like that undertaken in the space of a year in   would crash asset markets and risk leading to a hard economic landing
But if financial markets are already frothy now consider how frothy they will be in  when the Fed starts tightening and in  if not later when the Fed finishes tightening
Last time interest rates were too low for too long  and the subsequent rate normalization was too slow inflating huge bubbles in credit housing and equity markets
We know how that movie ended and we may be poised for a sequel
The weak real economy and job market together with high debt ratios suggest the need to exit monetary stimulus slowly
But a slow exit risks creating a credit and asset bubble as large as the previous one if not larger
Pursuing real economic stability it seems may lead again to financial instability
Some at the Fed  Chairman Ben Bernanke and Vice Chair Janet Yellen  argue that policymakers can pursue both goals the Fed will raise interest rates slowly to provide economic stability strong income and employment growth and low inflation while preventing financial instability credit and asset bubbles stemming from high liquidity and low interest rates by using macroprudential supervision and regulation of the financial system
In other words the Fed will use regulatory instruments to control credit growth risktaking and leverage
But another Fed faction  led by Governors Jeremy Stein and Daniel Tarullo  argues that macroprudential tools are untested and that limiting leverage in one part of the financial market simply drives liquidity elsewhere
Indeed the Fed regulates only banks so liquidity and leverage will migrate to the shadow banking system if banks are regulated more tightly
As a result only the Fed interestrate instrument Stein and Tarullo argue can get into all of the financial system cracks
But if the Fed has only one effective instrument  interest rates  its two goals of economic and financial stability cannot be pursued simultaneously
Either the Fed pursues the first goal by keeping rates low for longer and normalizing them very slowly in which case a huge credit and asset bubble would emerge in due course or the Fed focuses on preventing financial instability and increases the policy rate much faster than weak growth and high unemployment would otherwise warrant thereby halting an alreadysluggish recovery
The exit from the Fed QE and zerointerestrate policies will be treacherous Exiting too fast will crash the real economy while exiting too slowly will first create a huge bubble and then crash the financial system
If the exit cannot be navigated successfully a dovish Fed is more likely to blow bubbles
The Federal Reserve Relevance Test
NEW YORK  With interest rates near zero the US Federal Reserve and other central banks are struggling to remain relevant
The last arrow in their quiver is called quantitative easing QE and it is likely to be almost as ineffective in reviving the US economy as anything else the Fed has tried in recent years
Worse QE is likely to cost taxpayers a bundle while impairing the Fed effectiveness for years to come
John Maynard Keynes argued that monetary policy was ineffective during the Great Depression
Central banks are better at restraining markets irrational exuberance in a bubble  restricting the availability of credit or raising interest rates to rein in the economy  than at promoting investment in a recession
That is why good monetary policy aims to prevent bubbles from arising
But the Fed captured for more than two decades by market fundamentalists and Wall Street interests not only failed to impose restraints but acted as cheerleaders
And having played a central role in creating the current mess it is now trying to regain facenbsp
In  lowering interest rates seemed to work but not the way it was supposed to
Rather than spurring investment in plant and equipment low interest rates inflated a realestate bubble
This enabled a consumption binge which meant that debt was created without a corresponding asset and encouraged excessive investment in real estate resulting in excess capacity that will take years to eliminate
The best that can be said for monetary policy over the last few years is that it prevented the direst outcomes that could have followed Lehman Brothers collapse
But no one would claim that lowering shortterm interest rates spurred investment
Indeed business lending  particularly to small businesses  in both the US and Europe remains markedly below precrisis levels
The Fed and the European Central Bank have done nothing about this
They still seem enamored of the standard monetarypolicy models in which all central banks have to do to get the economy going is reduce interest rates
The standard models failed to predict the crisis but bad ideas die a slow death
So while bringing down shortterm Tbill rates to near zero has failed the hope is that bringing down longerterm interest rates will spur the economy
The chances of success are near zero
Large firms are awash with cash and lowering interest rates slightly won make much difference to them
And lowering the rates that government pays has not translated into correspondingly lower interest rates for the many small firms struggling for financing
More relevant is the availability of loans
With so many banks in the US fragile lending is likely to remain constrained
Moreover most smallbusiness loans are collateralbased but the value of the most common form of collateral real estate has plummeted
The Obama administration efforts to deal with the realestate market have been a dismal failure perhaps succeeding only in postponing further declines
But even optimists don believe that realestate prices will increase substantially any time soon
In short QE  lowering longterm interest rates by buying longterm bonds and mortgages  won do much to stimulate business directly
It may help though in two ways
One way is as part of America strategy of competitive devaluation
Officially America still talks about the virtues of a strong dollar but lowering interest rates weakens the exchange rate
Whether one views this as currency manipulation or as an accidental byproduct of lower interest rates is irrelevant
The fact is that a weaker dollar resulting from lower interest rates gives the US a slight competitive advantage in trade
Meanwhile as investors look outside the US for higher yield the flood of money out of the dollar has bid up exchange rates in emerging markets around the world
Emerging markets know this and are upset  Brazil has vehemently expressed its concerns  not only about the increased value of their currency but that the influx of money risks fueling asset bubbles or triggering inflation
The normal response of emergingmarket central banks to bubbles or inflation would be to raise interest rates  thereby increasing their currencies value still more
US policy is thus delivering a double whammy on competitive devaluation  weakening the dollar and forcing competitors to strengthen their currencies though some are taking countermeasures erecting barriers to shortterm inflows and intervening more directly in foreignexchange marketsnbsp
The second way that QE might have a slight effect is by lowering mortgage rates which would help to sustain realestate prices
So QE would produce some  probably weak  balancesheet effects
But potentially significant costs offset these small benefits
The Fed has bought more than  trillion of mortgages the value of which will fall when the economy recovers  which is precisely why no one in the private sector wants to buy them
The government may pretend that it has not experienced a capital loss because unlike banks it is not required to use marktomarket accounting
But no one should be fooled even if the Fed holds the bonds to maturity
The attempt to ensure that the losses are not recognized might tempt the Fed to rely excessively on untested uncertain and costly monetarypolicy tools  like paying high interest rates on reserves to induce banks not to lend
It is good that the Fed is trying to make amends for its dismal precrisis performance
Regrettably it is far from clear that it has changed its thinking and models which failed to maintain the economy on an even keel before  and are certain to fail again
The Fed previous mistakes proved extraordinarily costly
So will the new mistakes even if the Fed strives to hide the price tag
The Economist Stone
CAMBRIDGE  This year marks the th anniversaries of two distinct institutional innovations in American economic policy the introduction of the federal income tax and the establishment of the Federal Reserve
They are worth commemorating if only because we are at risk of forgetting what we have learned since then
Initially neither the income tax nor the Fed was associated with the explicit concepts of fiscal and monetary policy
Indeed it wasn until after the experience of the  that they came to be viewed as potential instruments for macroeconomic management
John Maynard Keynes pointed out the advantages of fiscal stimulus in circumstances like the Great Depression
Milton Friedman blamed the Depression on the Fed for allowing the money supply to fall
Keynes is associated with a belief in activist economic policy aimed at ensuring countercyclical responses to economic fluctuations  expansionary policies during recessions and policy tightening during upswings
Friedman by contrast opposed discretionary policymaking believing that government institutions lacked the ability to get the timing right
But both opposed procyclical policy such as the misguided US fiscal and monetary tightening of  before the economy had fully recovered President Roosevelt raised taxes and cut spending while the Federal Reserve raised reserve requirements prolonging and worsening the Great Depression
After World War II students and policymakers internalized the lessons of the 
But episodes in recent decades  for example high inflation in the   overwhelmed much of what was learned
As a result many advanced countries today are repeating the mistake of  despite facing similar macroeconomic conditions high unemployment low inflation and nearzero interest rates
The pros and cons of austerity nowadays have been thoroughly debated
Austerity proponents correctly point out that permanently expansionary macroeconomic policies lead to unsustainable deficits debts and inflation
Advocates of stimulus are right to note that in the aftermath of a recession when unemployment is high and inflation is low the immediate consequences of policy contraction are continued unemployment slow growth and rising debtGDP ratios
And procyclicalists both in the US and Europe represent the worst of all worlds by pursuing expansionary policies during booms such as in  and contractionary policies during recessions such as in 
But if countercyclicalists are right to favor moderating rather than exacerbating upswings and downswings in the economy we still need to know what works best
Given recent conditions is monetary or fiscal stimulus the more effective instrument
John Hicks addressed this question clearly in a oncefamous  article called r Keynes and the Classics
Under the conditions that prevailed then and that prevail again now high unemployment low inflation and nearzero interest rates monetary expansion is relatively less effective because it cannot push interest rates below zero
Moreover firms are less likely to respond to easy money by investing in new physical capital and labor if they cannot sell what they already produce in the factories they already have with the workers they already employ
Fiscal stimulus is relatively more effective in these conditions because it creates demand for goods without driving up those rockbottom interest rates and crowding out privatesector demand as it would in normal times
None of this should be controversial
Introductory economics used to emphasize the Keynesian multiplier effect recipients of government spending or of consumer spending stimulated by tax cuts or transfers respond to the increase in their incomes by spending more as do the recipients of that spending and so on
Again the multiplier is much more relevant under current conditions because it does not fuel higher inflation and interest rates and thus crowd out private spending
Unfortunately many economists and politicians have forgotten much of what they knew or have been blinded by new theories of policy ineffectiveness
Indeed by the time the  global recession hit even advocates of fiscal stimulus had lowered their estimates of the multiplier
But the continuing severity of recessions in the United Kingdom and other countries pursuing fiscal contraction has suggested that multipliers are not just positive but greater than one  just as the old wisdom had it
The International Monetary Fund has responded by forthrightly confessing that official forecasts including its own had underestimated the multiplier size
Of course the effects of fiscal policy are uncertain
One never knows for example when rising debt levels might alarm international investors who then start demanding sharply higher interest rates as happened to countries on the European periphery in 
We are also uncertain about the magnitude of the negative longterm effects of high tax rates on growth
And monetary policy is much better understood than it was in the past
Indeed a muchadmired recent paper characterized monetary policy as science and fiscal policy as alchemy
To be sure the state of knowledge and practice at central banks is close to the best that modern society has to offer whereas fiscal policy is set in a highly political process that is poorly informed by economic knowledge and largely motivated by officials desire to be reelected
But the problem with the ancient alchemists and their search for the philosopher stone was not that they were stupid or selfish people
Nor was their problem that political leaders refused to listen to them
Rather the state of knowledge at the time simply fell far short of the modern science of chemistry
In this sense the term alchemy could be applied to preKeynesians like US Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon whose prescription at the start of the Great Depression was to iquidate labor liquidate stocks liquidate farmers and liquidate real estate in order to urge the rottenness out of the system
It could also be applied to those today who favor returning monetary policy to the pre gold standard
This does not mean that either fiscal policy or monetary policy has graduated to the status of a science like chemistry underpinned by natural laws that generate precisely foreseeable outcomes
But surely we have learned since  that fiscal expansion is appropriate under some conditions even if it is inappropriate under others
The Female Economy
WASHINGTON DC  Today women own roughly  of small and mediumsize enterprises in developing countries and make up approximately  of the global workforce
Women consumer spending is projected to reach  trillion globally in 
And women contribute to their societies by investing their earnings in health education and family
Indeed when it comes to women economic value the numbers speak for themselves
And yet recent research by the World Bank Group documented discrepancies between treatment of women and men in  of  countries surveyed  policies and practices that severely limit women economic opportunities
For example in many countries husbands are required to sign off on their wives business transactions
And women in developing countries are more likely to work in an inefficient informal economy to be prevented by discriminatory laws from owning land and to face bias in establishing developing and financing their own businesses
Genderbased barriers to investment not only put women at a disadvantage they also reduce the entire economy growth potential
Indeed eliminating such barriers could raise labor productivity an estimated  in some countries
Moreover the world most competitive industries are those with the narrowest earnings gap between women and men
Three fundamental and interrelated genderspecific challenges must be addressed to make countries investment climate more womanfriendly
First women must have legal status
Second genderneutral laws require supporting institutions that do not drive genderbiased economic outcomes
Finally women must be better represented in networks such as chambers of commerce thereby giving them influence over key decisions affecting their communities
To be sure the investment climate in some countries is slowly becoming more responsive to women entrepreneurs needs
For example in Uganda banks now extend loans to women to buy land women in the Democratic Republic of Congo can officially register their businesses and in Indonesia women can use alternative forms of collateral to obtain loans
But women entrepreneurs need better access to finance
In much of SubSaharan Africa women applications for business loans are rejected
In Latin America women entrepreneurs can sometimes obtain loans though usually less than requested
And in most developing countries banks offer an inferior range of financial services to businesses owned by women
Indeed womenowned businesses unmet financial needs are estimated to total  billion annually with mediumsize businesses most adversely affected
After all microfinance institutions serve small business and traditional banks are more likely to lend to larger businesses  leaving those in the middle to fend for themselves
There is a strong case for offering financial products tailored to women entrepreneurs
DFCU Bank in Uganda for example has built a successful portfolio of business loans leases and mortgages that target women entrepreneurs
Before DFCU got involved women accounted for  of smallbusiness owners but received only  of available credit
Since  the bank has provided nearly  million to womenowned enterprises and in the process has been helping to drive Uganda economic growth
Banks elsewhere should take note genderbiased lending hurts the bottom line because it implies missing out on a massive untapped market
Indeed policymakers and financial institutions alike would do well to recognize that as abundant research and experience have shown sustainable growth cannot be achieved without women active participation
The Feminine Mystique Revisited
OLYMPIA WASHINGTON ampamp This year marks the th anniversary of the publication of Betty Friedan The Feminine Mystique 
Today many social conservatives still blame Friedan and feminism for inducing women to abandon the home for the workplace thus destabilizing families and placing their children at risk
But feminism was always more of a response to women entering the labor force than its cause
In Western Europe and the United States early capitalism drew huge numbers of young single women into industries like textiles
Mill owners often built dormitories to house young female workers
Many of these workers became early supporters of both the antislavery and the women rights movements while middleclass women were energized by and sometimes envious ofworking women vigorousparticipation in the public sphere
By the time Friedan book was published in  capitalism was drawing married women into the expanding service clerical and information sectors
Friedan ideas spoke to a generation of women who were starting to view paid work as something more than a temporary break between adolescence and marriage and were frustrated by society insistence that the only source of meaning in their lives should be their role as housewives
Wherever women enter the labor force in large numbers certain processes unfold
Women begin to marry later and have fewer children especially as they make inroads into higher education or more remunerative careers
They are also more likely to challenge laws and customs that relegate them to secondclass status in the public sphere or mandate their subordination within the family
Often governments and employers then find that it is in their interest to begin to remove barriers to women full participation
The dramatic decrease in laws and customs perpetuating female subordination over the past  years has been closely connected to women expanded participation in paid employment
Societies where women remain substantially underrepresented in the labor market such as in the Middle East remain especially resistant to women rights
Political scientist Michael Ross argues that the extreme gender inequality found in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is not caused by the intractability of Islamic tradition
Rather it is the result of how oil wealth shifted economic development away from manufacturing jobs that have historically pulled women into the labor force while promoting jobs in construction which tend to be dominated by men
Within the Muslim Middle East the oilrich states score much lower on indices of gender equity than oilpoor states such as Morocco Tunisia Lebanon and Syria
Social conservatives are wrong to blame women entry into work on feminism
But women who work are much more likely to adopt feministinspired agendas and to reject traditional ideas about marriageAnd when women gain economic and political clout traditional family life is indeed destabilized
In Western Europe and North America divorce rates soared as married women poured into the workplace in the  and  with women initiating most divorces
Although divorce rates leveled off in the  cohabitation and unwed childbearing have continued to rise
Nevertheless the best hope for improving family life todayis not to roll back women rights but tofurther women economic and political integration
Increases in women power and resources are most threatening to family stability in societies marked by gender inequality where successful women often rebel against marriage
In countries such as Japan Italy and Singapore where the terms of marriage remainfavorable to men and women have a hard time combining work and family working women postpone marriage and motherhood much longer than inthe US leading to declines in birth rates that threaten these societies future
As women gain collective rights and especially as men accept women changed roles many of the disruptive effects of family change are ameliorated
In the US divorce rates for welleducated women are now much lower than for lesseducated women and women with good jobs or who have completed college are more likely than more traditional women to be married at age 
In the past when a stayathome wife went to work the chance that her marriage would dissolve increased
Today going to work decreases the chance of divorce
In families where the wife has been employed longer men tend to do more and better childcare with measurable payoffs in child outcomes
Of course marriage will never again be as stable or predictable as whenwomen lacked alternatives
But even where family change continues apace it has far less negative consequences when women have access to economic rights than when they do not
In the Nordic countries outofwedlock births are much higher than in the US but children of single mothers are much less likely to experience poverty and spend more time on average with both biological parents because cohabitation there is more stable than in many American marriages
In poorer countries women access to paid labor is a better predictor of children wellbeing than the stability of marriage
In parts ofAfrica and Latin America children are better nourished and have more access to education in femaleheaded households where the woman has a job than in twoparent households where the man earns the incomeChildren from femaleheaded households in Kenya Malawi and Jamaica for exampledo as well or better than children from maleheaded households in their longterm nutritional and health status despite lower household income
Far from being a threat to family life the further progress of women rights may be our best hope for wellfunctioning families
The Feminist Curtain
PRAGUE Sometimes I feel like a schizophrenic
When in the West I criticize Western feminist ideas about Central Europe
At home I refrain from such criticisms and go after the potent antifeminist stereotypes of my homeland the Czech Republic
My unpopularity it seems cuts two ways
Thirty years ago I participated in similar EastWest debates
Back then the issue was socialism with Western university students imagining that salvation would somehow be found through street demonstrations and leftwing politics
Having experienced what a real socialism was all about I could only disappoint them shattering their illusions
Today many Western feminists think in similar ways to those leftists of the s
They apply broad generalizations to very different and usually inappropriate situations
Their overall effort may be useful because it injects into Central European debates a diversity of ideas that is essential for people who once lived in the sterile atmosphere of a totalitarian regime and where habits of conformity linger
But the lives of women in Western and Eastern Europe are far too different for Western feminist notions to be imported whole
Many Western feminists cling to the belief that socialisms fall harmed women or at least threw them back into the past
They deemed it a plus of the old regime that more women sat in socialist parliaments that women received free medical care that women held jobs once reserved for men that the social situation of women was more stable
This is also an opinion held by some women in the Czech Republic and even more often among women in those postcommunist societies where living standards nowadays seem lower today than under the Communists
I try of course to convey to my Western colleagues the truths about the situation of women under Areal socialism
When I do however I only succeed as before in destroying illusions ime the naive belief that a solution to the plight of women had been found in the now discarded socialist regimes
Todays uncertainties make the past look rosier than it was
It is the lack of stability that is responsible for so many confused memories about socialism
The totalitarian state limited crime or rather made it less visible
Corruption followed well established patterns and life seemed safer because it was more predictable
In a situation of seemingly ceaseless change and fluidity it is not surprising that women identify stability and social guarantees with an allpowerful government
The truth is that the position of women in the Czech Republic has changed since B for the better and for the worse
The employment rate of women has decreased by about  benefits to single mothers have been lowered it has became more difficult to sue to collect alimony
There are fewer measures that actively promote the equality of women
And there has been a decrease in the number of women in politics
It is easy to forget however that under socialism all political decisions  important or not  were taken in a Politburo packed with old men
Also everyone now knows what free socialist medical care was really like and as for jobs performed by women they were very poorly paid
State paternalism directed not only at women inculcated a helplessness that can be blamed for many of our current difficulties
While many appreciate the new horizons that have opened for them a lingering ambivalence about their relationship to the paternalistic totalitarian state remains
One hears frequent complaints by women that the new democratic authorities are too weak to help or protect them effectively
It seems like a vicious circle
A totalitarian state will never promote the sort of pluralist democratic society that by its nature limits state power
A weak state however can be overrun by special interest groups corruption and crime and so force citizens into selfdefensive withdrawals into the very traditional structures that held women back in the past
Such a state cannot protect those unable to withstand competition and cannot provide for their needs
So the temptation of the weak is to yearn for a strong state
Nevertheless in the Czech Republics parliamentary elections of  the majority of women voted for the ruling rightofcenter parties
Through their ballots they pronounced themselves in favor of continuing the processes of political democratization and the creation of a market economy
They expressed a preference for an efficient rather than a strong state
They seem willing to surrender some social guarantees in exchange for that efficiency and increased personal liberty
It is to this readiness that Westerners feminist or not should pay attention
The decision by the majority of Central European women to decline state protection and accept competition is more important than determining whether or not women are proportionately represented on the boards of large banks or whether they fly in economy or business class
The Fight for Food
GENEVA  Every year  million mothers and children below the age of five die in poor countries because they do not have the nutrition they need to fight common diseases
Threequarters of them could have survived diarrhea or malaria if they had been properly nourished
For those who do survive the future looks grim all studies show that children who are undernourished in the first two years of life suffer health problems and lag in development for the rest of their lives
Insufficient nourishment impedes their capacity to learn fitness to work and ability to develop their talents
Besides the human suffering the economic costs of malnutrition are huge according to the World Bank countries where malnutrition is most prevalent lose on average between  and  of their GDP
The issue is not severe and acute malnutrition which hits populations suddenly usually as a result of conflict
The question is how we attract the attention of the European Union and the G countries to the malnutrition that experts call idden hunger which affects one in every three people worldwide
It is caused by imbalanced nutrition or a lack of vitamins and essential minerals that enable the human body to grow and that maintain its vital functions
For example recent data show that even a moderate deficiency of Vitamin A results in higher mortality
In fact we could avoid the death of at least one million children every year by improving their intake of it
Doing so would not be difficult
Humans have added essential vitamins or minerals to their foods since time immemorial indeed since the beginning of the twentieth century food fortification has been a major government policy in developed countries to reduce nutritional deficiencies and improve public health
All scientific studies of such interventions prove that fortification of basic foodstuffs works
Chile promoted the addition of iron to milk resulting in a  reduction of anemia amongst babies
The fortification of maize meal with folic acid in South Africa  one of the projects supported by the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition GAIN  was followed by a  reduction in spina bifida a serious deformation of the neural tube in newborn babies
Moreover these essential interventions cost little and deliver a lot to enrich cooking oil with Vitamin A costs less than  per liter and fortification in general has a benefittocost ratio of at least eight to one
What is missing is the willingness to act
At GAIN we are convinced that there is an urgent need to fight malnutrition if the world wants to achieve the United Nations Millennium Development Goals which commit the world to halving global poverty and hunger by 
Fighting malnutrition is the first step toward reaching this objective
Science has demonstrated the costeffectiveness of food fortification and the technologies and knowhow are available in the private sector which has the capacity to innovate and deliver products to the poorest
Europe and the G must act
Not only do they need to make the fight against malnutrition a policy priority they also must invest
The equation is straightforward  million for fortification programs could improve the health of one billion people
To put that amount into perspective the regular move of EU institutions between Brussels and Strasbourg costs  million per year
While the latter is an understandable expense historically the time has come for the EU and G to make different political choices that help keep  million mothers and children alive and well
The Fight for Middle Germany
BERLIN  Germany has made its choice
It voted the grand coalition out of office with a bang consigning the Social Democrats to the political abyss Only ruins remain of the onceproud Gerhard Schrder SPD
Despite a clear win for the centerright the Christian Democrats CDU did not escape unscathed
But while their losses were moderate CDU Bavarian sisterparty the CSU experienced a debacle second only to the Social Democrats
So it looks like SPD hit rock bottom CSU is in freefall and CDU the worse for wear
The clear winners are Guido Westerwelle and his Liberal party followed by the Left and the Greens  all three of which got their highest vote count ever
But the reality is a bit more complicated
The clearest winner is Angela Merkel
The chancellor played for high stakes seemingly against the odds and hit the jackpot
Unlike her party she is now stronger than ever
So will we see a new Merkel a chancellor who freed from the restraints of SPD in the governing coalition will be more decisive reformist and willing to take political risks
Don bet on it
Merkel barely avoided political oblivion in the last general election after the CDU had embraced market radicalism and then campaigned on it in 
Her savior came in the unlikely form of the then Social Democratic Chancellor Gerhard Schrder whose wild performance on election night handed her the chancellorship
To be sure fortune and success are inseparable in politics
But Merkel hasn tried to press her luck since then
On the contrary she has unflinchingly steered the CDU towards the left because she learned three things from the CDU election defeat in  and its narrow victory in  Germans don want to go to war don think much of economic reform and are mostly to the left of the CDUCSU
Merkel could attempt this strategy because she knew that her right flank was covered by the FDP which would attract voters dissatisfied with the CDU leftward turn but then join in a CDUled coalition
At the same time by moving to the left Merkel ousted the SPD from the political center  where elections are won and lost in Germany  while still being able to form a workable majority in the new fiveparty system without risking new coalition constellations and fierce internal conflict
In other words the secret of Merkel election victory was to secure a majority for the centerright in order to pursue more or less a centerleft policy agenda
A change of tack by Merkel now would merely reinvigorate the devastated SPD
To be sure the lack and yellow CDUFDP coalition will make some policy corrections  slowing the nuclear phaseout cosmetic changes to the tax system etc  in order not to disappoint parts of their constituency and economic supporters
But there will be no clearcut change in policy direction
That said governing will hardly be a cinch for Merkel
In the coming years she will face the economic crisis increasing unemployment mounting public debt and demographic challenges at home as well as tough foreignpolicy choices in Afghanistan Iran Pakistan and the Middle East
Moreover with the grand coalition gone she will no longer be able to blame SDP obstructionism for her inaction
Indeed Merkel room for maneuver will be reduced
Until now Merkel had to deal with a weak or nonexistent opposition
This will change very quickly particularly given the possibility of NATO troop increases in Afghanistan
From now on she will require a trait that she has lacked so far leadership and decisionmaking skills
The victory of black and yellow has moreover defined the alternative red dark red and green
The political camps of old  left and right  are back for the time being
If this situation prevails beyond  the SPD will face an unenviable challenge
It will have to manage a realignment that includes a possible coalition with the Left at the federal level but without moving too far to the left in policy terms
The SPD together with the Greens will have to take the fight to the political center which precludes competing with the Left for fringe voters
Moreover the Left  a party that is descended from the former East Germany ruling Communists and Social Democratic dissenters  will have to play ball by embracing political realism
The best way to achieve this is through the Left participation in regional  lnder governments
But it is difficult to predict whether such a division of labor with the disenchanted former Social Democrat Oskar Lafontaine will be possible
And the Greens
Their part in such a constellation will be to represent middleclass and ecologically oriented voters
If however a scramble towards the left occurs within the left camp the Greens would stand to lose as would their most likely coalition partners
The Fight for Pakistan Soul
CAMBRIDGE  As its army confronts ever more bloodily the Taliban in the Swat Valley Pakistan is fighting for its very soul
The army appears to be winning this time around in marked contrast to its recent halfhearted confrontations with Taliban forces in neighboring tribal areas
For now the Taliban are on the run some with shaved beards and some in burqas  to avoid being recognized and thrashed
The reason is simple increasingly people across Pakistan support the army action
This support persists despite the terrible humanitarian cost more than  million internal refugees
This round of fighting was preceded by a negotiated calm as the government sought to quell militants in Pakistan tribal areas by striking a deal with the Taliban leader Sufi Mohammad
The deal which instituted a version of Sharia law in the region in exchange for a commitment that militants would lay down their weapons was blessed by the comparatively liberal Awami National Party ANP which governs the NorthWest Frontier Province NWFP where Swat is located
But the Taliban assurances of a lower profile were upended by two incidents that exposed its real face
First private news channels broadcast across the country a video clip recorded on a cell phone of the public flogging of a yearold Swat girl
This gave the public a stark sense of what Taliban justice really meant
Then Mohammad was interviewed on GEO TV where he explained his political views
According to Mohammad democracy is unIslamic as are Pakistan constitution and judiciary and Islam bars women from getting an education or leaving their homes except to perform the Hajj in Mecca
Religious conservatives were stunned
Leaders of the religious parties rushed to denounce Mohammad views
The Pakistani media revisited a famous comment by Mohammad Iqbal the poetphilosopher who devised the idea of an independent Muslim state in Pakistan
he religion of the mullah he said s anarchy in the name of Allah
Still it not over until it over  and in the short term a lot depends on the state capacity to hold the Swat area and reestablish civilian institutions there
And even if the state succeeds reasserting control over Swat will only be the first step
The Taliban is spread throughout the NWFP and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas
unjabi Taliban militants from the fighting in Kashmir against India continue to shuttle between the Punjab heartland and the Northwest Territories posing another serious challenge to government authority
In the longterm however what really matters is whether the Muslims of South Asia will be able to roll back the spread of Talibanization altogether
The answer to that question lies within the various Muslim communities of the region not just in Pakistan
Afghanistan faces an election later this year
A clear and transparent vote will make a real difference in establishing the credibility of the Afghan government
In Pakistan the democratic transition after years of military rule is still not complete
There is much hope though in the vibrancy of the Pakistani media as well as in the energy that the legal community generated last March in restoring deposed Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry to his seat on the Supreme Court
Then there is the Pakistani army the country uper political party
To a large degree Pakistan relations with India Afghanistan and the United States depend on the military
Army commander Ashfaq Kiyani has shown no interest in taking over the state as his predecessor General Pervez Musharraf did
But the army must accept its subservience to Pakistan political leadership
The army command must finally recognize that repeated military interventions have not served the country well
Most significantly in the face of martial law and political assassination Pakistanis have not given up their dream of democracy
A living example of this is Afzal Lala a Pashtun politician associated with the Awami National Party who despite all the threats from the bloodthirsty TehrikeTaliban Pakistan remained in Swat through the recent fighting
Democracy will be decisive because it generates investments in education health and economic empowerment that reward ordinary voters
Talibanization gains ground when people lose faith in the capacity of the modern state to improve their lives
While poor law enforcement needs urgent attention counterterrorism is never solely a military affair
Financial pledges from the US and the riends of Pakistan consortium the European Union China and Japan are important but when it comes to investing wisely in development projects Pakistan track record is nothing to be proud of
Effective oversight from donors and Pakistan private sector will be critical
Only one condition should be imposed on aid for Pakistan the first money should be spent on rebuilding all the bombedout girls schools in Swat
If need be the army should guard these schools around the clock
The Fight for Shareholder Rights in Russia
MOSCOW Abuse of shareholders by managers and majority owners cripples foreign investment in Russia
No surprise then that improving corporate governance and protecting minority shareholders is becoming a concern of the Putin government
Refusing shareholders entry to shareholders meetings or striking their names off share registers  two popular gimmicks of a few years ago  are rarer nowadays
Some ligarchs have undergone Damascene conversions and are trying to improve their image among investors
A few companies such as the oil giant Yukos even appoint independent directors from abroad
These private sector improvements however are nowhere to be seen among large businesses controlled by Government even though many of these firms have a substantial minority of private shareholders who need protection from managerial abuse
Management in these firms indeed has become more arrogant and inventive in violating shareholder rights
As an independent member of the boards of electricity utility RAO UES and the gas giant Gazprom I know directly of their waywardness
United Energy Systems UES is headed by Anatoly Chubais a former deputy prime minister with a reputation as a reformer
At board meetings tame inhouse managers usually outvote me
If UES bosses want to buy a skyscraper despite UES making a  million loss it is fine with them
In November we were asked to approve  without review  huge overpayments on administration
Sometimes we hear that UES has acquired a TV station or finances a political faction in the Duma via a subsidiary
Extracting information on any of these matters is almost impossible
After  years as CEO Chubais decided to estructure UES thinking that glib talk about competition and liberalization will garner him continued support from London and New York
He tried to browbeat investors at a board meeting in the Kremlin where  in good Soviet tradition  everyone was expected to vote unanimously to split the company into small pieces so as to sell them at low prices to cronies political allies and friendly oligarchs
When shareholders balked Chubais sought to neutralize his opponents unilaterally changing the agreement with the Bank of New York to control the votes of most holders of American Depository Rights ADRs
Disgusted many UES shareholders sold their shares
Others are fighting on  calling an extraordinary shareholders meeting complaining to Government possibly suing
What do investors want
To solve the issue of government set electricity rates to stop theft and mismanagement to put the company house in order before any estructuring
No investor believes that current management will sell UES assets at fair prices
Similar misdeeds with added twists exist in the energy giant Gazprom where oldstyle Soviet managers misrule
The issue again is shareholder value with shareholders worrying that billions of dollars are disappearing from the company
These suspicions are bolstered by the fact that Gazprom shares have underperformed the market for years and the fact that the company does not pay proper dividends
Shareholders know of hundreds of agricultural enterprises hotels luxury villas banks investment companies and corporate jets owned by Gazprom
These have little to do with Gazprom main business are lossmaking and are probably used to channel company money to managers
Indeed subsidiaries where managers hold shares through their children and other relatives  say the huge construction company Stroitransgaz which has billiondollar contracts with Gazprom  are created regularly and shareholders seem powerless to stop such practices
Shareholders also hear of Gazprom providing financial guarantees to parties which  officially at least  have nothing to do with its business
One example is the MediaMost group which for reasons unknown was financed by Gazprom to the tune of more than half a billion dollars
It is even said in Moscow that a reason behind the recent arrest of MediaMost owner Vladimir Gusinsky in Spain on an Interpol warrant is the desire by Moscow prosecutors to discover everything Gusinsky knows about Gazprom inner workings
But secret deals with MediaMost are but the tip of the iceberg
Creating boundless suspicions are Gazprom links to the Floridabased company ITERA which grew into a multibillion enterprise on par with Gazprom in only a few years
Investors suspect such phenomenal growth was achieved at Gazprom expense
In Ukraine for example billions of dollars of Russian gas supplies go unpaid every year
Russia Government talks with Ukraine government
To no avail
Suddenly we discover that onethird of Ukraine gas supplies are controlled by ITERA and wonder why this is so and where the money is going
Because the Government has not sufficiently liberalized domestic gas prices manipulation is easy
Gazprom sales in Russia are often disguised as murky barter deals
Despite this Gazprom holding company appears to be rolling in cash while its production subsidiaries mostly appear bankrupt and never pay their taxes in full
As a minister I once put pressure on Gazprom over taxes and was summoned to parliament by indignant deputies
Many Duma members and local governors owe their jobs to Gazprom
Managers of Governmentcontrolled companies like Gazprom and UES live in a style befitting oligarchs create nest eggs for themselves and play around in politics
Why are clear suspicions of corruption assetstripping and outright theft not investigated and punished even though both companies are majorityowned by the Government and most of the board membership is state appointed
Putin inaction looks like weakness and these scandals discourage foreign investment
President Putin silence here is surprising
To make progress in corporate governance at statecontrolled companies Putin does not need new laws or IMF loans
He should pick up the phone and fire managers who compromise Russia
This would be the clearest sign of his intention to put reform on the right track
Private investors  indeed all Russia citizens  are watching and waiting
The Final Decline of the West
PARIS  In  will demographers speak of he white man loneliness in the way historians once referred to he white man burden to describe the socalled mperial responsibilities of some European nations
Demography is not an exact science
Countless dire predictions from that of Malthus to that of the Club of Rome have been proven wrong
But according to a recent and very convincing essay published in the magazine Foreign Affairs  a dual demographic and economic trend is taking place that will result in spectacular shifts by the middle of this century
The Western world will represent only  of the world population with Europeans reduced to 
In  a year before the outbreak of World War I Europe was slightly more populated than China
Economically the West will account for around  of global output  a level that corresponds to Europe share in the eighteenth century and down from  in 
What we are witnessing can be seen is a return to the past with the West returning to its old place in the world before the start of China long process of historical decline at the beginning of the nineteenth century
The West long period of global dominance is ending encouraged and accelerated by its own mistakes and irresponsible behavior
We are entering a new historical cycle in which there will be proportionally fewer Westerners more Africans and Middle Easterners and  with greater relevance economically and strategically  many more Asians
It is with these figures in mind that one must consider Barack Obama decision not to attend the next EuropeanAmerican summit that was due to take place in Madrid in May
It would be tempting to use a formula coined during the Cold War to describe the comparative evolution of the United States and the Soviet Union and to apply the notion of ompetitive decline to the relationship between the US and Europe
An America that may be undergoing a process of relative if not absolute decline chooses to ignore a Europe that in US eyes is no longer a problem compared with Asia or the Middle East and that offers little help in finding solutions to the problems that most vex Americans
In a hasty and excessively provocative manner some in the American media are starting to speak of Obama as  second Jimmy Carter and predict that he will serve only one term
What is more serious is the impression that the American political system with its inability to transcend party divisions and forge national consensus is increasingly sclerotic
Americas political institutions have aged like the country infrastructure
They were devised more than two centuries ago for a mostly agrarian world
Today they need to be amended and rejuvenated
But that may not be possible given the sacrosanctity with which many Americans regard the US Constitution
As for the European Union the problem is not what will not happen in Madrid
The EU problem is much more what happened in Copenhagen last December at the summit to ave the planet or what is taking place before our eyes with the challenge to the euro posed by the weakness of some of its member states most prominently Greece
In Copenhagen Europe came with a common and responsible position
The EU was howing the way to other great actors and behaved as the ood pupil of the world class
The Union was ignored with the US and China choosing to disagree over its head
Europe must realize that it cannot be seen as a model for anyone if no one any longer takes it seriously as a global actor
But how can you be taken seriously by others if you do not take yourself seriously
The EU new High Representative for external affairs Baroness Catherine Ashton tried to justify her failure to go to Haiti in the immediate aftermath of its terrible earthquake by saying  am neither a nurse nor a fire person
Lack of such skills did not keep US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from traveling to the scene of the devastation to show here support and concern
Confronted with revolutionary demographic and economic transformations Americans and Europeans should behave in a much more responsible manner
Instead of ignoring the other the American way or lamenting a wounded ego the European way they should confront the common challenges they face as a result of a globalization process that they are no longer able to master
The Final Defeat of Thomas Malthus
The UN recently revised its population projections
Some  billion people now live on Earth
If fertility rates in relatively poor countries continue to follow the trends set by todays relatively rich countries we are within shouting distance of the worlds maximum population billionto be reached in 
But population may well decline thereafter
Literate welleducated women with many social and economic options in todays rich countries have pulled fertility below the natural replacement rate
The problem is not that such women on average want fewer than two children in fact on average they wish to have a bit more than two
But because many of them delay childbearing until their thirties actual fertility falls short of what they desire
A world population that peaks at  billion is not one in which we have to worry about Parson Malthus the English th century economist who prophesied a future in which people multiply faster than the resources needed to sustain them and hence starve to death by the millions
Indeed it comes as somewhat of a shock to realize that the age of the population explosion may be coming to an end
Just thirty years ago people like Stanford Universitys Paul Ehrlich were telling us that the Malthusian Angel of Death was at the door
They assured us that it was too late to stop the famines that would kill hundreds of millions in the Indian subcontinent and that humanitys destiny in the st century was one of war and struggle for the resources to feed national populations an extra crust of bread
Today however the political flashpoint over food is not that there is too little but that there is too much
Developingcountry politicians and populations complain bitterly that the rich industrial countries are growing too much food
Exporting food is one of the few ways we can earn the foreign exchange we need to buy modern industrial technology they say
But your agricultural subsidy programs block us from establishing any sort of comparative advantage in most agricultural products
You say free trade is good in those manufactures that you exportyou say that enforcing property rights is critically important for your investorsbut somehow you go deaf when the topic turns to a level playing field in agricultural trade
They are right
Not every developing country can grow rich by making and exporting computer chips or plastic toys or bananas
Some need to export steel
Others will have to export furniture or textiles
Still others will have to export citrus grains processed foods etc
Yet there has been little forward motion in opening up world trade for nearly a decade
Given the complexion of the US Democratic Partys key constituencies this is not surprising
On the contrary what is surprising is that President Clinton was so willing to swim against the tide generated by his own laborprotectionist base in  and  and establish NAFTA and the WTO
It is also very surprising that the post Republican administration of George W Bush has been so hostile to freer trade
Indeed Bush has backed several major antiliberal initiatives a steel tariff the expansion of agricultural subsidies and a declaration that FTAA Free Trade Agreement of the Americas negotiations cannot even consider the impact of US agricultural subsidy programs on trade
Blockages to world trade jeopardize global economic development
Technology transfer is incredibly difficult
It may well turn out that  worth of aid are a poor substitute for even  worth of exports because there are few better schools in which to internalize the organizational forms and technologies built since the start of the Industrial Revolution than the school of exporting
If global development is at risk then so is the final defeat of Malthus
If the poorest countries stay poor their rates of population growth might fall much more slowly than the United Nations predicts
Falling birthrates depend on a rise in the status of women confidence in public health growing prosperity and strong cultural cues to convince people that there are other better indicators of success than a large family
The fact that most countries are completing the demographic transition does not guarantee that all will
Perhaps Malthus will rule again in geographically small but densely populated and immensely poor parts of the globe
The worlds high and middleincome countries should not imagine that the relatively rich can fence themselves off indefinitely from poverty and misery in the poorest countries
Nationalism has long been a powerful cause of political violence
Nothing is more likely to strengthen nationalism and turn it to violence than a sense that ones own homeland is being exploitedkept poor and powerlessby other nations to satisfy their own selfish interests
The world today is too small for any of us to be able to afford for any corner of it to be left out of the conquest of Malthusianism
The Financial Crisis One Year After
NEW YORK  It is now almost a year since the world economy teetered on the edge of calamity
In the span of three days September   Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy the megainsurance company AIG was taken over by the United States government and the failing Wall Street icon Merrill Lynch was absorbed by Bank of America in a deal brokered and financed by the US government
Panic ensued and credit stopped circulating
Nonfinancial companies could not get working capital much less funding for longterm investments
A depression seemed possible
Today the storm has broken
Months of emergency action by the world leading central banks prevented financial markets from crashing
When banks stopped providing shortterm liquidity to other banks and industrial companies central banks filled the gap
As a result the major economies avoided a collapse of credit and production
The sense of panic has subsided
Banks are once again lending to each other
Although the worst was avoided much pain remains
The crisis culminated in a collapse of asset prices at the end of 
Middleclass and wealthy households around the world felt poorer and therefore cut their spending sharply
Skyhigh oil and food prices added to the pain and thus to the downturn
Enterprises could not sell their output leading to production cuts and layoffs
Rising unemployment compounded the loss of household wealth throwing families into deep economic peril and leading to further cutbacks in consumer spending
The big problem now is that unemployment continues to rise in the US and Europe because growth is too slow to create enough new jobs
Dislocations are still being felt around the world
A huge debate has ensued around the socalled timulus spending in the US Europe and China
Stimulus spending aims to use higher government outlays or tax incentives to offset the decline in household consumption and business investment
In the US for example roughly onethird of the billion twoyear stimulus package comprises tax cuts to stimulate consumer spending onethird is public outlays on roads schools power and other infrastructure and onethird takes the forms of federal transfers to state and local governments for health care unemployment insurance school salaries and the like
Stimulus packages are controversial because they increase budget deficits and thus imply the need to cut spending or raise taxes sometime in the near future
The question is whether they successfully boost output and jobs in the short term and if so whether they do enough to compensate for the inevitable budget problems down the road
The true effectiveness of these packages is not clear
Suppose that the government gives a tax cut in order to increase consumers takehome pay
If consumers expect that their taxes will rise in the future they may decide to save the tax cut rather than boost consumption
In that case the stimulus will have little positive effect on household spending but will worsen the budget deficit
An early assessment of the stimulus packages suggests that China program has worked well
The sharp fall in China exports to the US has been compensated by a sharp rise in the Chinese government spending on infrastructure  say on subway construction in China biggest cities
In the US the verdict is less clear
The tax cut has probably been saved rather than spent
The infrastructure component has not yet been spent because of long lags in turning the US stimulus package into real construction projects
The third part  the transfer to state and local governments  almost surely has been successful in maintaining spending on schools health and the unemployed
In short the US stimulus effects on spending have probably been positive but small and without a decisive effect on the economy
Moreover concerns about the enormous US budget deficit now running at  trillion  of GNP per year are bound to increase not only creating enormous uncertainties in politics and financial markets but also dimming consumer confidence as households focus their attention on potential future budget cuts and tax increases
The US has reached the practical limits of reliance on shortterm stimulus spending and will need to start cutting the budget deficit and fostering alternative pathways to growth
When the crisis deepened a year ago Barack Obama introduced into the presidential campaign the theme of a reen recovery based on a surge of investment in renewable energies new electric vehicles environmentally efficient reen buildings and ecologically sound agriculture
In the heat of the battle against financial panic policy attention turned away from that green recovery
Now the US needs to return to this important idea
Debtburdened consumers in the US and Europe will limit their spending for years to come as they rebuild their wealth and pension assets
But the resulting economic slack gives us the historic opportunity  and need  to compensate for low consumer spending with increased investment spending on sustainable technologies
Government policies in the US and other rich countries should stimulate those investments through special incentives
These include a capandtrade system for greenhousegas emissions subsidies for research and development on sustainable technologies feedin tariffs and regulatory incentives for renewable energy consumer subsidies and other inducements for the uptake of new reen technologies and implementation of reen infrastructure programs such as mass transit
The rich world should also provide the poorest countries with grants and lowinterest loans to buy sustainable energy technologies such as solar and geothermal power
Doing so would add to the global recovery improve longterm environmental sustainability and accelerate economic development
The crisis can yet be an opportunity to turn from a path of financial bubbles and excessive consumption to a path of sustainable development
In fact seizing this opportunity is the only recipe for genuine growth that we have left
The Financial Hurricane Hits Latin America
LOS ANGELES  A few weeks ago the world was on the edge of disaster
Fortunately the decisive actions taken by the advanced countries monetary authorities  including provision of unprecedented amounts of liquidity  prevented a complete financial meltdown
The world has avoided the rgentinization of the international financial system
What has not been avoided is a recession that will be deep long and global
In the coming months nearly every region in the world will experience economic deceleration with exports declining and unemployment increasing
Recent events have disproved the notion that emerging nations had ecoupled themselves from the advanced economies
The facts have shown the opposite to be true
Most emerging economies are still fragile and affected by what goes on in the advanced countries
The effects of this recession will be particularly severe in Latin America
Brazil and Mexico have been the hardest hit so far to the point that the value of their firms has fallen by approximately 
The situation in these countries is so serious that a few days ago the United States granted them credit for up to  billion
But Brazil and Mexico are not the only ones hit by financial volatility Chile currency has lost a third of its value in Peru the cost of external financing has soared and in Argentina the government has had to resort to extreme measures  such as the nationalization of the pension system  in order to avert an imminent fiscal calamity
Indeed with the recession possibly lasting  months or more  which would make it the longest since World War II  Argentina will be one of the hardest hit
Its external financing needs are enormous and its exports will fall sharply
But politics will also play a role in Argentina economic distress
The administration of President Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner generates a great deal of distrust among local and foreign investors who fear arbitrary measures
The recent decision of Standard and Poor to lower Argentina rating is fully justified and reflects many analysts fear that Argentina will again default on its public debt
Mexico and Central America will also suffer from the long recession
For many years their economic fate has been closely tied to that of the US
These ties increased with the signing of bilateral freetrade treaties with the US so there is a good chance that they could experience negative growth in  and perhaps in the first half of  as the US goes into recession
Less affected by the financial crisis and the US recession will be those that have developed with an eye toward Asia nations  particularly Chile Colombia and Peru  and have accumulated resources to meet unexpected financial storms
They will be quicker to recover their levels of employment
But the most important question is what will happen in Brazil Latin America giant
Over the past few years analysts and investors around the world began to see Brazil as an economic power in the making
There was mention of a miracle and many argued that Brazil would grow spectacularly like China and India and no longer be the eternal country of he future
Unfortunately everything suggests that this was an illusion based on wishful thinking
Brazil boom of the past few years stood on an incredibly weak foundation
President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva did indeed decide to avoid the rampant populism of Hugo Chvez of Venezuela and successfully tackled inflation
But it takes more than that to become a great economic power
What Lula did was simply to decide that Brazil would be a ormal country
But more than controlled inflation is needed to create a robust economy with a high and sustainable growth rate
Agility dynamism productivity and economic policies that promote efficiency and enterprise are required
As many studies have shown Brazil has not been able  or has not wanted  to adopt the modernizing reforms needed to promote a productivity boom
Brazil is still an enormously bureaucratic country with an educational system in crisis very high taxes mediocre infrastructure impediments to the creation of businesses and a high level of corruption
It is sad but true in recent years Brazil did not opt for modernization and efficiency and will have to pay the consequences during the difficult years ahead
The Fire Down Below
WARSAW Bombing Serbia and Serb forces in Kosovo are not exactly what NATOs new members in Central Europe expected when they joined the Wests premier security organization
Poland but also Hungary and the Czech Republic believed they were joining yesterdays NATO  an alliance to protect Europe against threats from the East
It is this goal that made them mobilize resources and public opinion in order to join the privileged group
Now they find themselves in an organization in the process of radical transformation
It is said of NATOs attack on Serbia that it is the first war of the st century
Fighting in Kosovo is the first significant conflict which for one side at least involves no considerations of strategy territory population natural resources or even ideology
The West is fighting a war over principles a war as President Clinton put it to end a moral tragedy
At issue is an attempt to stop an epidemic the carriers of which in th century Europe have been nazism communism fascism and now nationalism
NATO for the first time has intervened in the internal affairs of another country
This is a significant change in NATO policy which downgrades the idea of the sovereignty of states and elevates the status of ethical norms in international relations
A lot seems to rest on a consensus about moral norms and about who is right and who is wrong
While few question the immorality of Serbs behavior future moral crusades may be more controversial
In addition to moral considerations the decision to intervene was motivated by concerns about the future of EuropeanAmerican relations and of NATO after the cold war
The fall of the Soviet Union undercut the primary source of NATOs legitimacy
Who is threatened by Russia today
It is Russias weakness that is a threat and raises fears of chaos unforseen uses of nuclear weapons or another Chernobyl
NATO is in the process of working out a new doctrine that is to be adopted later this month in Washington during the celebrations of NATOs th anniversary
It remains a defensive alliance but one ready to attack to protect peace and stability or to fight terrorism and nuclear proliferation
The new NATO raises the urgent issue of public support
Why people ask should the allied countries pay the heavy price of war and perhaps sacrifice the lives of their soldiers when there is no danger to their national security or vital national interests
In the era of immediate access to information and the shock of television images wars cannot be conducted without popular support
Superficially this makes morally motivated wars easier scenes of misery on TV incite visceral emotional reactions and feelings of solidarity
But public opinion can change when a conflict does not involve ones own security or vital interests especially when the allied victims are ones sons and brothers or the other party responds with terrorist attacks
Fear of the fickleness of public opinion leads to reliance on technology and the doctrine of zero victims  the myth of war without risks that dominates todays allied actions
All are aware that ground troops are necessary to end the expulsions of ethnic Albanians and chase the Serbs from Kosovo
Nevertheless Presidents Clinton and Chirac Prime Ministers Blair and Shroeder cling to the notion that ground troops will only enter the fray in what Clinton euphemistically calls a permissive environment
Bombing is thus a compromise between activity and inactivity between the necessity of intervention and the unwillingness to bear risks
Declaring in advance  in defiance of the elementary rules of war making  that NATO will not use ground troops gave Milosevic the advantages of initiative and a sense of security
While NATO conducted its air attacks paramilitary Serbian bands more or less controlled by Belgrade conducted their own war against civilians
How pathetic the reaction of NATOs Secretary General Javier Solana We may not have the means to stop it but we have shown that we have the will to try
We are thus faced with a dramatic contradiction between universalist aspirations and an unwillingness to pay the price these aspirations demand
The result is a choice of palliatives
Here is the root of NATOs weakness and a serious question about its future
The Soviet threat generated a readiness to defend oneself and to bear heavy burdens
Can one count on this readiness when the threat is real but more diffuse abstract potential and often geographically remote
The durability of the alliance depends on the answer to this question
The West has lost the battle of Kosovo but certainly not yet the war
The stakes are high
From the perspective of the allies they involve more than the dramatic fate of the expelled Kosovars and Balkan stability
At stake is NATO and the future of EuropeanAmerican relations
Paradoxically NATOs recent actions have undermined the very credibility they were supposed establish in the new postcoldwar environment
Prominent among those who anxiously await a solution to this paradox are the newest members of the Atlantic alliance
The Fire in the Monastery
PRAGUE  The grim spectacle of young monks nuns and lay people setting themselves on fire to protest conditions in their homeland is a stark reminder of the gloom and despair that now prevails on the Tibetan Plateau
These acts of selfimmolation  at least  since March   have been staged to protest the increasingly heavy controls that China government in Beijing has imposed on Buddhist religious practices
At the end of May a selfimmolation occurred for the first time in Lhasa the capital which may be a powerful portent of new turmoil in Tibet
The selfimmolations are a stark rebuke to the Chinese government claims that the lives of many in Tibet have been improving
These singular acts of desperation irrespective of their motives should be viewed in the wider context of ongoing religious and political problems in Tibet
Current official Chinese policies threaten the continuing existence of the Tibetan language culture religion heritage and environment
Simmering tensions have been fueled largely by the lengthy eeducation campaigns imposed on the Tibetans who are forced to renounce publicly their spiritual leader and profess patriotism and loyalty to China
The escalating situation in the AbaNgaba region a heavily Tibetan area in Sichuan province where tensions have led to the imposition of unprecedented security measures is particularly worrisome
Aba has long had one of the densest concentrations of Buddhist monks and monasteries anywhere in the world
The security crackdown to stem protests there and the virtual sealing off of the Kirti Monastery in Ngaba where the first of the current wave of selfimmolations occurred appears merely to have spread protest farther afield
Article  of the Constitution of the People Republic of China guarantees all citizens the right to freedom of religion therefore religious freedom in Tibet should be respected
In April a group of  Nobel Peace Prize laureates sent a letter to Chinese President Hu Jintao urging him to espect the dignity of the Tibetan people and open eaningful dialogue with His Holiness the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders
The US Senate and the European Parliament have adopted resolutions expressing their frustration over Chinese policies
There should be no doubt that the rest of the world is well aware of the gross violation of the Tibetan people fundamental rights and dignity
China has legitimate aspirations to be accepted as a responsible stakeholder in global affairs
But the best way for its government to achieve this goal is to demonstrate that it can care for the needs of all of the people living in China including Tibetans in a responsible manner
The Chinese government should contemplate the merits of greater openness in Tibet and put a stop to intimidation and harassment which merely breed further frustration and resentment
The fate of people arbitrarily imprisoned due to their religious beliefs and participation in recent protests adds to the growing worries about stability in Tibet
To ensure greater transparency the Chinese authorities should lift restrictions on visits by independent international media and humanrights monitors to provide as accurate a picture of the situation on the ground as possible
The international community ought to initiate an open and honest dialogue with China at all levels urging it to guarantee freedom of religion to all of its citizens in accordance with its international obligations  and its own laws
The Fire Next Time
The Fire This Time in Haiti
Haiti once again is ablaze
President JeanBertrand Aristide is widely blamed and he may be toppled soon
Almost nobody however understands that todays chaos was made in Washington  deliberately cynically and steadfastly
History will bear this out
In the meantime political social and economic chaos will deepen and Haitis impoverished people will suffer
The Bush Administration has been pursuing policies likely to topple Aristide since 
The hatred began when Aristide then a parish priest and democracy campaigner against Haitis ruthless Duvalier dictatorship preached liberation theology in the s
Aristides attacks led US conservatives to brand him as the next Fidel Castro
They floated stories that Aristide was mentally deranged
Conservative disdain multiplied severalfold when President Bill Clinton took up Aristides cause after he was blocked from electoral victory in  by a military coup
Clinton put Aristide into power in  and conservatives mocked Clinton for wasting Americas efforts on nation building in Haiti
This is the same right wing that has squandered  billion on a far more violent and dubious effort at nation building in Iraq
Attacks on Aristide began as soon as the Bush administration assumed office
I visited President Aristide in PortauPrince in early 
He impressed me as intelligent and intent on good relations with Haitis private sector and the US
No firebrand he sought advice on how to reform his economy and explained his realistic and prescient concerns that the American right would try to wreck his presidency
Haiti was clearly in a desperate condition the most impoverished country in the Western Hemisphere with a standard of living comparable to subSaharan Africa despite being only a few hours by air from Miami
Life expectancy was  years
Children were chronically hungry
Of every  children born more than  died before their th birthday
An AIDS epidemic the worst in the Caribbean was running unchecked
The health system had collapsed
Fearing unrest tourists and foreign investors were staying away so there were no jobs to be had
But Aristide was enormously popular in early 
Hopes were high that he would deliver progress against the extraordinary poverty
Together with Dr Paul Farmer the legendary AIDS doctor in Haiti I visited villages in Haitis Central Plateau asking people about their views of politics and Aristide
Everybody referred to the President affectionately as Titid
Here clearly was an elected leader with the backing of Haitis poor who constituted the bulk of the population
When I returned to Washington I spoke to senior officials in the IMF World Bank InterAmerican Development Bank and Organization of American States
I expected to hear that these international organizations would be rushing to help Haiti
Instead I was shocked to learn that they would all be suspending aid under vague instructions from the US
America it seemed was unwilling to release aid to Haiti because of irregularities in the  legislative elections and was insisting that Aristide make peace with the political opposition before releasing any aid
The US position was a travesty
Aristide had been elected President in an indisputable landslide
He was without doubt the popularly elected leader of the country  a claim that George W Bush cannot make about himself
Nor were the results of the legislative elections in  in doubt Aristides party had also won in a landslide
It was claimed that Aristides party had stolen a few seats
If true  and the allegation remains unproved  it would be nothing different from what has occurred in dozens of countries around the world receiving support from the IMF World Bank and the US itself
By any standard Haitis elections had marked a step forward in democracy compared to the decades of military dictatorships that America had backed not to mention long periods of direct US military occupation
The more one sniffed around Washington the less Americas position made sense
People in positions of responsibility in international agencies simply shrugged and mumbled that they couldnt do more to help Haiti in view of the Bush veto on aid
Moreover by saying that aid would be frozen until Aristide and the political opposition reached an agreement the Bush administration provided Haitis unelected opposition with an openended veto
Aristides foes merely had to refuse to bargain in order to plunge Haiti into chaos
That chaos has now come
It is sad to hear rampaging students on BBC and CNN saying that Aristide lied because he didnt improve the countrys social conditions
Yes Haitis economic collapse is fueling rioting and deaths but the lies were not Aristides
The lies came from Washington
Even now Aristide says that he will share power with the opposition but the opposition says no
Aristides opponents know that US rightwingers will stand with them to bring them violently to power
As long as that remains true Haitis agony will continue
The First And Last Soviet Parliament
MOSCOW The attempt ten years ago to create the first democratically elected parliament in the USSR proved to be the most unpredictable of Gorbachevs reforms the domestic equivalent indeed of his decision to allow Eastern Europe to break with communism
Gorbachevs other domestic reforms dealt with economic and cultural problems even alcohol abuse here was a bid to reform the system of power
Like much else about perestroika it foundered on a lack of clear goals
A former dissident I was not only one of the first elected peoples deputies of the Soviet Union and the Supreme Soviet but also a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
After almost  years of banishment from work even as a school teacher I suddenly found myself near the seat of power in the Kremlin
As an historian I saw this as a unique opportunity to witness history first hand
Let me review some of what I saw
Communist leaders first and foremost Gorbachev expected increased democratization to strengthen the partys hand
Instead the new parliament soon got out of control by passing laws that destroyed the Communist monopoly on power and undermined Gorbachevs authority
The new parliament also provided an outlet to confront the countrys mushrooming problems
Soon the new Congress of Peoples Deputies as well as the newlyformed parliaments of the Russian Federation and other USSR republics became political battlefields unleashing processes that lead to the collapse of the Communist Party and the USSR
The fate of that first democratic parliament was ignominious  it functioned for only half its term and was abolished by Yeltsins Russian parliament
But the fate of that Russian parliament was more dramatic  it was dispatched in  by paratroopers under the rumble of tank fire
Many people see those first democratically contested elections as the main achievement of Gorbachevs reforms
At the time I did not attach much importance to them as there remained so many ambiguities that continued Communist control seemed assured
I did not change my opinion even after I was nominated to run for election in Moscows Voroshilov district
Despite the district communist party committee supporting someone else I was elected
Indeed independent candidates like me won in  districts across the country among them Andrei Sakharov
Evgeny Primakov was also elected deputy of the USSR from the Communist list his first step into politics
It was Boris Yeltsin however who enjoyed the biggest triumph
In  he had been stripped of all party jobs his political career lay in ruins
Nonetheless he was nominated as a candidate in  districts
He ran in the biggest the Moscow nationalterritorial district which included all Moscow and received  of votes cast
This success propelled Yeltsin back into bigtime politics
Because that first Congress lacked clear regulations and an agenda Gorbachev had a hard time maintaining order
Gorbachev hoped to use the Congress to exert pressure on the conservative party apparatus but most deputies even Communists declared that the wishes of their electorate not party committees were now their priority
The leading role of the Communist Party evaporated before our eyes
The Supreme Soviet elected by that Congress was more tame
It dealt with routine issues created committees and discussed a lot of laws
But conditions in the country were worsening
Strikes were mounting
The confidence of the Politburo and Government cracked as leaders did not know what to choose from the numerous reforms being offered
The old clarity of ideology and propaganda was lost
Meanwhile the velvet revolutions ignited across Eastern Europe
The Berlin Wall fell
The Warsaw Pact and COMECON disintegrated
Nobody in the Soviet leadership knew how to react to these events no clear decisions were made
International communism disappeared not with a bang but a whimper
The upshot of this retreat was that dissatisfaction with Gorbachev increased among party and state structures but their obstructions remained disorganized
Formation of a radical democratic opposition was much surer
A group of  peoples deputies formed in the summer of  became the center of opposition
Sakharov became their unofficial leader but Yeltsin was the most popular figure
Attacked by Communists and radical democrats alike Gorbachev found himself in a precarious position one compounded by the fact that the USSR appeared to be coming apart at the seams
National Fronts were gaining strength in Ukraine the Caucasian republics the Baltics
In the face of this Gorbachevs political retreat continued
In exchange for introducing presidential rule he canceled article  of the USSR Constitution which proclaimed the Communist Partys leading role
But Gorbachev did not have the courage to hold national presidential elections
He was instead elected USSR President in March  by only  of the Congress
Still no one imagined that collapse of the entire system was fast approaching
Gorbachevs choice to combine socialism and democracy was not all wrong though many now denounce it as such
Our country needed democracy and economic reform but few understood that democracy and the market economy are complex systems which could not develop easily in an unprepared social and economic environment
Back in  I had a discussion with Sakharov who claimed that the USSR could be transformed into a democracy within two years
I thought  years of ceaseless effort would be the minimum necessary
Soviet society was like a lake surrounded by high dams of totalitarian power
But the dams were worn out threatening a flood
Pentup energy had to be released but cautiously
Gorbachevs actions did not create any reliable floodgates they merely opened cracks in the decrepit structures of power
The gap between totalitarian and democratic systems remained too wide it was impossible to jump over in a single bound
Two years after that first democratic parliament was summoned the Soviet Union collapsed but Russias peoples did not turn to radicals of either the right or left
That commonsense alone prevented catastrophe civil war and conflicts among the former Soviet republics
Extremists of all kinds simply failed to capture the imagination of the masses
So even as the USSR imploded Russia turned out to be stronger and more disciplined and realistic than many people expected
Such cohesion even in the worst of times has even allowed Russias people to display new respect for the first Soviet president although these recent displays were caused by the sad death of Raisa Gorbachev
Russias history for the last  years has been harsh but elections for a new Duma this December and presidential elections next summer will again demonstrate that our people have the discipline to persevere despite a decade of chaos
The First World Fiscal Follies
CAMBRIDGE  The world advanced economies remain divided over whether to strengthen budget balances in the short term or to use fiscal policy to promote recovery
Those worried about the shortrun contractionary effects on the economy call the first option usterity those concerned about longterm sustainability and moral hazard call it iscipline
Either way the debate is akin to asking whether it is better for a driver to turn left or right depending on where the car is either choice might be appropriateLikewise when an economy is booming the government should run a budget surplus when it is in recession the government should run a deficit
To be sure Keynesian macroeconomic policy lost its luster mainly because politicians often failed to time countercyclical fiscal policy  ine tuning  properly
Sometimes fiscal stimulus would kick in after the recession was already over
But that is no reason to follow a destabilizing procyclical fiscal policy which piles spending increases and tax cuts on top of booms and cuts spending and raises taxes in response to downturns
Procyclical fiscal policy worsens the dangers of overheating inflation and asset bubbles during booms and exacerbates output and employment losses during recessions thereby magnifying the swings of the business cycle
Yet many politicians in the United States the United Kingdom and the eurozone seem to live by it
They argue against fiscal discipline when the economy is strong only to become deficit hawks when the economy is weak
Consider the positions taken over the last three decades by some American politicians
In his  campaign and again in  a period of recessions President Ronald Reagan urged immediate action to reduce the national debt
In  however as the economy approached the peak of the business cycle candidate George HW Bush was unconcerned about budget deficits even though the national debt was rapidly approaching three times the level that it had been under Reagan
ead my lips no new taxes Bush famously declared
Predictably Bush and the US Congress finally summoned the political will to raise taxes and rein in spending growth at precisely the wrong moment  in  just as the US was entering a recession
Although the timing of the legislation was poor the action was courageous payasyougo PAYGO budgeting rules and other reforms deflected government finances back onto a path that eliminated the budget deficit by the end of the decade
But three years later  at the start of the most robust recovery in American history  all Republican congressmen voted against President Bill Clinton  legislation to maintain Bush spending caps PAYGO and tax increasesEven after seven years of strong growth at the peak of the business cycle in  with unemployment at record lows George W Bush based his  campaign on a platform of large tax cuts
After recovery from the  recession had gotten underway and the inherited budget surpluses had nonetheless turned to record deficits the Bush administration pushed through a second round of tax cuts in  and maintained a rate of spending growth that was triple the rate under Clinton
As Vice President Richard Cheney put it eagan proved that deficits don matter
These policies were maintained for another five years as another  trillion was added to the national debt
Predictably when the worst recession since the Great Depression hit in  politicians were reluctant to launch an adequate fiscal response owing to the huge deficits and debts that the government had already been running
Republicans suddenly rediscovered the evil of budget deficits
They opposed Obama initial fiscal stimulus in February  and succeeded in blocking further efforts when its effects petered out two years later
In my view the government spending cutbacks of the last two years are the most important reason why the economic recovery that began in June  subsequently stalled in 
Here then are three generations of politicians who favored fiscal expansion during booms    and austerity during recessions    
A similar unfortunate cycle  large fiscal deficits when the economy is already expanding followed by fiscal contraction in response to a recession  has also been visible in the UK and the eurozone in recent years
Turning left every time the road goes right and vice versa is worse than switching policies randomly
But the pattern is understandable when the economy is booming there is no political support for painful spending cuts or tax increases
There is a hole in the roof but the sun is shining
Then when the thunderstorms roll in sinners suddenly get religion and proclaim the necessity of reforming  just when it is most difficult to fix the problem
Historically it used to be developing countries whose dysfunctional political systems produced procyclical fiscal policies
Almost all of them showed a positive correlation between government spending and the business cycle from  to 
But things have changed
About a third of emergingmarket countries governments  including authorities in China Chile Malaysia South Korea Botswana and Indonesia  managed to reverse the historical correlation
They took advantage of the  boom to strengthen their budget positions saving up for a rainy day
They were thus in a good position to use fiscal stimulus when the global recession hit them in 
In fact a majority of the governments that have pursued countercyclical fiscal policies since  are in emergingmarket or developing countries
They figured out how to achieve countercyclical fiscal policy during precisely the decade when so many politicians in dvanced countries forgot
The Fiscal Crisis Down Below
PALO ALTO  Subnational governments  states countries cities provinces towns and special districts  play different roles from country to country but usually deliver important public services such as police and fire protection transportation education health care and welfare
In many countries their fiscal position has collapsed under the combined weight of mismanagement and the global economic and financial crisis
The relationship between subnational and central governments includes the general division of responsibilities for providing and financing public services national subsidies that at least partly pay for various services delivered locally and tax collection
In the United States the federal government has primary responsibility for defense public oldage pensions Social Security and health care for the elderly Medicare subnational governments are responsible for education and law enforcement
Health care for the poor Medicaid is a shared responsibility
Matching funds flow from the federal government to state and local governments by formulae delineating the shared responsibilities
Some of these formulae allow subnational governments wide discretion others do not
The global economic and financial crisis has precipitated an immense expansion of central government spending borrowing and hence future taxing lending regulation and mandates some in id to subnational governments about  billion in the US stimulus bill
A key question is whether central governments power worldwide will expand permanently  over not only the private economy but also over subnational governments
There is remarkable variability in the role of subnational governments relative to central governments
Prior to the current crisis US government revenue was roughly  federal and  state and local
France was the most centralized of the major economies with roughly a  split between the national and subnational governments while the United Kingdom falls in between at 
China was the least centralized at   Argentina was the most balanced at about 
Debates about government centralization run deep in the history and constitutions of most countries
The US Constitution knitted together the thirteen original colonies and its Tenth Amendment reserves to the states all powers not expressly delegated to the federal government
Even today tensions over further centralization eg to supranational authority as in Europe and devolution eg for Scotland Qubec or Kurdistan are intense
There are several reasons to favor a healthy dose of decentralization
US Supreme Court Judge Louis Brandeis famously argued for he states as laboratories
A recent example in the US was welfare reform
When states got waivers for time limits and work or training requirements for welfare recipients they were so successful that federal welfare reform followed
Competition among localities  for example between states for businesses and workers and between school districts for students  can lead to more efficient and effective allocation of public resources
If people are able to migrate they will move to jurisdictions with the mix of taxes and services eg quality schools that they prefer
As with competition in private markets competition in government services leads to better outcomes
Local authorities are closer to problems than national officials tucked away in a country capital
There are important differences among jurisdictions
Hospitals are more important for some areas while schools are more important for others
Geographic costofliving differences are difficult to reflect in onesizefitsall national programs
Some functions are better suited for centralgovernment financing
National defense is an obvious example as are functions for which economies of scale are important
Where localities try to offload support for the poor onto other localities the central government must step in and either fund such programs directly or set minimum standards
In the US until the past three decades local school districts were responsible for education
Various court rulings have determined that this process allowed richer districts to spend more than poorer ones and ordered states to equalize spending
States from California to Texas now routinely collect previously local property taxes to fund schools and then redistribute them to local school districts
Many believe that the reduction of local control over the schools as a result of the elimination of local financing has been a major contributor to the poor performance of some American schools
California is an example of longrun fiscal folly meeting shortrun national and global economic crisis resulting in chaos
For many decades Californians had rapidly rising living standards great public K and higher education systems and unprecedented upward mobility
But California unemployment rate  in November  was tied for the nation third highest
People and jobs are seeking better opportunities elsewhere
The state bond rating is dead last
Excessive state spending heavy regulation and dangerously high taxes have helped create the state economic woes
The top personal incometax rate also levied on capital gains the sales tax rate the corporate tax rate and the gas tax are all at or near the highest of any state
The top  of the state income earners pay almost half the income taxes
Thus the state coffers and hence spending overflow during booms but then collapse forcing emergency retrenchment during busts
Ironically California progressive tax and spending policies create such volatility that they destroy the state ability to fund everything even basic services from education to health for its most vulnerable citizens
Now facing another  billion deficit despite temporary tax hikes and spending cuts California fiscal woes foreshadow those of many subnational  or indeed national overnments globally
While all must first deal with the current emergency sensible local fiscal tax and political reforms are vital to restore a balance of centralized and decentralized government
The Fiscal Cliff and US Foreign Policy
PRINCETON  The world should be worried
The possibility that US President Barack Obama and the Republicans in Congress will fail to reach a compromise before mandatory deep spending cuts and tax increases take effect on January  is very real
Global markets are well aware of the danger of the United States falling over the iscal cliff and are watching nervously
They know that this outcome could well throw the US  and the world  back into recession
Foreign ministries around the world should be equally nervous
Unless the US can get its fiscal house in order it will be forced to abdicate leadership on a wide range of critical global issues
In the short term Syria and its neighbors are already paying the price of America inability to focus on anything other than domestic politics since Obama reelection
In my view the Syrian crisis is at a tipping point while it is now apparent that the opposition will eventually win and President Bashar alAssad will fall the endgame duration will be a key element determining who actually comes into power and on what terms
Syria implosion and the chaos and extremism that are likely to breed there will threaten the entire Middle East the stability of Lebanon Jordan Turkey Iraq Gaza the West Bank Israel Iran and Saudi Arabia hangs in the balance
But we do not even know who will succeed Hillary Clinton as US Secretary of State when Obama second term formally begins in January or who will be on the White House security team
In the medium term the world abounds with tensions and potential crises that US leadership is likely to be indispensable to resolving
As events over the past two weeks in Egypt have demonstrated all too vividly the Arab awakening is still only in its first act in many countries
Indeed democracy is fragile at best across North Africa and in the Middle East Jordan the Palestinian territories Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have only begun to feel the ripples of the tidal wave sweeping the region
Bahrain remains a flashpoint Iraq is deeply unstable and the simmering conflict between Iran and Israel could flare up at any time
Even when the US is not on the front lines it has played a vital role in behindthescenes diplomacy nudging wary rivals closer to one another to create a united opposition and working with regional leaders like Turkey Egypt and Saudi Arabia to broker deals
In Asia the US has been playing a similar role in pushing for multilateral resolution of dangerous bilateral disputes between China and its many neighbors over territories in the East and South China Seas while at the same time restraining US allies who might otherwise provoke crises
And on big global issues like climate change organized crime trade and prevention of atrocities the absence of the US as a policy catalyst and active negotiator will be quickly and keenly felt
Avoiding this fate requires the US to ebuild itself at home as the Obama administration  National Security Strategy promises
But if US politicians spend the next two years the way they have spent the last two  patching together temporary policy fixes while avoiding the hard issues that voters and markets expect them to face  America voice will grow fainter and weaker in international institutions and affairs
Equally worrisome is the prospect of deep acrosstheboard cuts in the US defense budget at a time when many rising powers are increasing their defense spending
As much as many countries may dislike the US military the availability and extraordinary capabilities of America soldiers ships aircraft and intelligence assets often function as a global insurance policy
In the long term the challenge is more vague but deeper
The longer the US obsesses over its own political dysfunction and attendant economic stagnation the less likely it is to bear the mantle of global responsibility and leadership
Openly isolationist political forces such as the Tea Party and libertarians like Ron Paul will grow stronger
A retreating US will in turn guarantee the emergence of what foreignpolicy analyst Ian Bremmer describes as a Zero world in which no country will take the lead and marshal the necessary economic and political coalitions to solve collective problems
Individual presidents and secretaries of state will certainly try
But without Congressional support they will bring fewer and fewer resources to the table and will suffer from an increasing credibility gap when they seek to negotiate with other countries
Global leaders can do more than stand by and watch
Why not remind US politicians of their global responsibilities
The G or G leaders could issue a statement for instance urging the US to get its fiscal house in order
NATO allies could make a similar statement
Indeed other regional organizations such as the African Union or the Arab League could weigh in
Even G members were they so moved could make a statement
Of course when we think about the G we immediately wonder who other than the US could organize the issuance of such a statement
That is precisely the problem and it could get much worse
The Fish that Shrank
A thousand years ago the Norse settlers of my home city of York ate cod that weighed as much as eight kilograms
We know this from archaeologists and the fascination they have for medieval waste heaps
But today you would be lucky to find a cod that weighs more than two kilograms
What have we done to our fish stocks to bring about changes like this and does it matter
Fisheries policy is designed to allow small fish to grow
This is for the best of reasons  fish that are caught when they are too small will produce a small yield
Moreover the fish will not have had a chance to reproduce undermining the fish stock altogether
For example the avowed intention of the EU Common Fisheries Policy is to protect fish resources by regulating the amount of fish taken from the sea 
 by allowing young fish to reproduce
  and by ensuring that measures are respected
As it stands however we have fished down our stocks until few large old individuals remain
To see this consider North Sea cod
Suppose you start with ten thousand individuals aged one year
If there is only natural mortality about one thousand of these individuals survive to reach age eight years
A moderate level of fishing mortality brings the number of survivors down to about one hundred individuals
But the levels of fishing mortality we have been applying over the last twenty years bring the number of survivors down to about three
Mortality acts cumulatively so given the way we manage fisheries few individuals survive to become big and old
Yet left to their own devices cod are thought to live for at least thirty years
It is a testament to the great efficiency with which we exploit living marine resources that fish like cod are now much more likely to die at the hands of fishermen than for all other reasons put together once they get into the fisheries
The absence of big old individual cod and other fish is worrisome from the standpoint of the shortterm ecological health of the stock as well its longerterm genetic health
The shortterm issue concerns egg production which in many fish is proportional to body size large individuals contribute far more to future generations than small individuals
In fact first attempts at spawning can be relatively unsuccessful so a fisheries policy that depends for the most part just on firsttime spawners which is what we are approaching now could be especially flawed 
The policy is also suspect because the success of spawning is notoriously variable from year to year
A bad year for recruitment in a fisheddown stock means losing both the new cohort and most of the spawners because the latter are caught before they can spawn again
By contrast a stock with lower mortality for large individuals at least maintains an adequate reserve of large individuals available as spawners next year
The longterm concern is that fishing is intended to be selective fishermen aim to harvest the most profitable species and the most profitable sizes within species
Like all other forms of life fish stocks change genetically when directional selection is applied
The effect of fishingdown is to give an advantage to genes causing slow growth but early adulthood
Indeed there is evidence from many fisheries of earlier maturation such changes take place fast enough to be detected over the decades
For example early in the twentieth century you would not find a mature cod in the North Sea less than about  centimeters in length whereas by the s mature cod were as small as  centimeters
So there is a lot of underage sex out there in the sea
By cherishing our large old fish we would reverse the selection for early maturation while selecting for faster growth through the size classes most vulnerable to fishing 
The genetic changes that we are bringing about in our fish stocks are going largely unrecognized
Yet the precautionary principle places some responsibility on us to hand down the living resources of the marine realm in a form that can be used as much by future generations as by us
Radical new thinking is needed in fisheries management to overcome the ecological and evolutionary problems generated by current practice
If only one change in the prevailing mindset could be made it should be to realize that in the case of fish like cod big is beautiful
To reconstruct our approach to fisheries management with measures that increase the survival of large old individuals would be good for the health of our stocks in the short term and would be appreciated by our descendants
The Flawed Options in Darfur
The longsought joint peacekeeping force for Darfur which would combine the existing man African Union force with as many as  additional military personnel and civilian police under UN command has now been approved
But several roadblocks still stand in the way making it very difficult for the joint AUUN mission to bring about a peaceful settlement to the Darfur conflict
Although UN SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon pressed the UN Security Council to move rapidly to authorize the proposed joint force member governments remain deadlocked over its mandate
With the encouragement of Sudan government China and Russia have thus far blocked a resolution sponsored by Britain and France that would allow the proposed hybrid force o use all necessary means to protect humanitarian workers and other civilians
Sudan UN ambassador has called for a draft whose language is ore Sudanfriendly
Moreover UN analysts estimate that most of the additional troops will not arrive in Darfur until early next year
The preceding phase envisages only providing the existing AU force with extra logistical support from nonAfrican countries such as engineers from China
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner has called for merging these two phases to accelerate progress which would require substantial funds to secure and deploy the additional UN peacekeepers
According to JeanMarie Guehenno the head of UN peacekeeping operations any hybrid force must be obust because of the ery challenging situation in Darfur
The draft BritishFrench resolution would provide for an authorized ceiling of  military troops and  police officers with an estimated cost of over  billion during its first year
The Bush administration has been a leading advocate of deploying a robust peacekeeping operation in Darfur
But the United States is impeding this process by falling far behind in its obligatory payments to the UN peacekeeping budget with total US arrears estimated at more than  million  and possibly exceeding  billion by the end of 
The EU has also encountered difficulties in fulfilling its pledged financial assistance to the existing AU force in Darfur
Moreover the division of labor for any joint mission  especially regarding financing and command  remains unresolved
Many African leaders insist that they should retain principal control of any peacekeeping force in Darfur
Their preferred model calls for the UN to provide the funding and most other support for the mission while allowing the AU to maintain its leadership role
Many Western governments however refuse to place their forces under AU command owing to its perceived weaknesses and have conditioned further support for peacekeeping operations in Darfur on the UN assuming control
But the UN has found it difficult to attract sufficient volunteers for such a force since foreign governments have acceded to Sudanese demands that the hybrid force remain predominantly African
At the same time the complex chain of command envisaged for an AUUN force recalls some of the worst features of NATOUN operations in the former Yugoslavia during the 
AU commanders on the ground would retain tactical control a joint AUUN command would exercise operational supervision and the UN would establish the force overall strategic objectives
Such a convoluted command system will make it difficult to react to any rapidly developing crisis or threat
Indeed even if foreign troops reduce the violence peace might last only as long as they remain deployed since the conflict has evolved from a struggle between rebel groups and the Sudanese government into one between various clans and ethnic groups with the government intervening on behalf of its allies
The example of Kosovo is revealing
Eight years after the  NATO intervention a strong international force is still needed to prevent a resurgence of violence and Kosovo ultimate political status remains unresolved
A major peacekeeping operation in Darfur would likely produce a similar situation protracted uncertainties regarding the region future political status impeded socioeconomic development persistently diverging expectations among the conflicting parties unresolved tensions resulting from nonfulfillment of these expectations and the likelihood of renewed violence should the foreign intervention force withdraw
In addition an extensive military operation in Darfur would not necessarily secure the region unless it also addressed the problems in the rest of Sudan
The UN Human Rights Committee has found that widespread and systematic human rights abuses extend throughout Sudan not just Darfur Foreign Policy magazine considers Sudan the country most at risk of state failure
For these reasons any major peace operation involving Western countries would soon lead their governments to consider regime change in Khartoum as the most viable exit strategy
Because the Sudanese government recognizes this as well it will resist any such deployment regardless of foreign threats and blandishments
The Flight to Quality
BERKELEY  In late May the yield to maturity of the year United States Treasury bond was  per year  down a full half a percentage point since the start of the month
That means that a year Treasury bond had jumped in price by more than 
So a marginal investor was willing to pay more than  more cash and more than  more equities for US Treasury bonds at the end of the month than at the beginning
This signals a remarkable shift in relative demand for highquality and liquid financial assets  an extraordinary rise in marketwide excess demand for such assets
Why does this matter
Because as economist John Stuart Mill wrote in the first half of the nineteenth century excess demand for cash or for some broader range of highquality and liquid assets is excess supply of everything else
What economists three generations later were to call Walras Law is the principle that any market in which people are planning to buy more than is for sale must be counterbalanced by a market or markets in which people are planning to buy less
We have seen this principle in action since the early fall of  as growing excess demand for safe liquid highquality financial assets has carried with it growing excess supply for the goods and services that are the products of ongoing human labor
This is true to such an extent that there is now a  gap between the global economy current output and what it would be producing if it were in its normal relatively healthy state of nearbalance
And global financial markets are now telling us that this excess demand for safe liquid highquality financial assets has just gotten bigger
To some small degree a change in investor sentiment has induced the rise in excess demand for such assets
After all we can assume that the animal spirits of investors and financiers has been further depressed as a psychological reaction to the exuberant belief just a few years ago in the powers of financial engineering
But most of the recent shift has come not from an increase in demand for safe liquid highquality financial assets but from a decrease in supply six months ago bonds issued by the governments of southern Europe were regarded as among the highquality assets in the world economy that one could safely and securely hold now they are not
The argument six months ago in favor of those bonds seemed nearly airtight
Yes the liabilities of southern Europe private sector were speculative and potentially insecure but the region was part of the eurozone and thus its governments debts were backed by the European Central Bank which in turn was backed by the governments of France and Germany which in turn were backed by the willingness of French and German taxpayers to pay for the longrun project of closer European integration
Neither the French nor the Germans obviously want to contemplate any possibility of a return to the days when every generation they would kill each other over the question of which language should be spoken by the mayor of Strasbourg or is it Strassburg
Now things are not so certain
When there is excess demand for safe liquid highquality financial assets the rule for which economic policy to pursue  if that is you want to avoid a deeper depression  has been wellestablished since 
If the market wants more safe highquality liquid financial assets give the market what it wants
After all as a socialresource planning mechanism does a market tells us which things are valuable and thus gives us the signal to make more of them
Markets are now signaling that US Treasury bonds are much more valuable assets than they were a month ago
So those governments whose credit is still unshaken and whose assets are still the benchmarks of quality for the world economy should be creating a lot more of them
Creditworthy governments around the world can create more safe liquid highquality financial assets through a number of channels
They can spend more or tax less and borrow the difference
They can guarantee the debt of privatesector entities thus transforming nowrisky leaden assets back into golden ones
Their central banks can borrow and use the money to buy up some of the flood of risky assets in the market
Which of these steps should the world creditworthy governments take in response to the assetprice movements of May
All of them because we really are not sure which would be the most effective and efficient at the task of draining excess demand for highquality assets
How much should they do
As long as there is a clear global excess supply of goods and services  as long as unemployment remains highly elevated and inflation rates are falling  they are not doing enough
And the gap between what they should be doing and what they are doing grew markedly in May
This isn rocket science or capping deepsea oil blowouts
These are problems that we have long known how to solve
The Fog of Finance
Military leaders talk about the og of war  the condition of fundamental uncertainty that marks combat
The recent credit and liquidity crisis has revealed a similar condition in financial markets because no one not even central banks seems to understand its nature or magnitude
It is often suggested that what is called the ubprime crisis was the result of lax monetary policies that led to excess liquidity in financial markets
But there is an obvious paradox here because how can an 
 excess
 of liquidity result ultimately in a 
 shortage
 of liquidity that has to be made up by central banks
In fact monetary laxity can be a symptom not of excess liquidity but of excess saving
This is reflected in increasing income inequality in much of the developed world and the vertiginous surpluses of oilproducing countries and Asian nations
The emergence of sovereign wealth funds like those of China and the Gulf states to invest the savings of these countries budget surpluses is but the tip of the global excess savings iceberg
Whereas excess liquidity is inflationary and calls for higher interest rates excess saving is deflationary and calls for lower rates
This brings us to the dilemma faced by central banks
When central bankers cannot avoid a crisis  or when they contribute to create one  their fundamental mission is to do 
 everything
 in their power to contain its impact 
Their actions their every word or wink suddenly assumes immense importance
The central banker is not only a lender of last resort but also a speaker of last resort
In both respects the United States Federal Reserve has fared much better than the European Central Bank in this most recent crisis
If the problem is excess saving and if uncertainty erodes confidence a massive injection of liquidity such as the ECB in response to the subprime crisis may be necessary but not sufficient
A rate cut also may be required to restore confidence
The Fed has understood that message
Europe needs to know why the ECB has not 
Moreover the Fed efforts were ultimately stabilizing because it stated its intentions clearly prior to taking action
By contrast in late August the ECB governor JeanClaude Trichet referred to the monetarypolicy decision taken before the crisis to justify the possibility of a rate hike then left rates on hold
On September  Trichet said that the ECB had maintained the 
 status quo
  leaving it unclear what he meant
Indeed whereas the ECB seemed to have implicitly accepted an objective of economic growth it maintained its hard line against inflation on October 
The reason for the ECB inertia obscurity and rigidity is simple the ECB is only incidentally in charge of economic growth in the euro area its primary objective is rice stability
Yet the current crisis like others that preceded it shows that monetary policy governs anticipations not only of inflation but also of growth whether central banks like it or not 
So long as the ECB does not acknowledge the doubts now hovering around Europe economies there is a risk of a crash
The ECB is convinced that benign neglect is the right exchange rate policy and that the G is the right place to address currency volatility
But the euro is a European affair
Why should a situation in which Europe is bearing the burden of weak currencies in the US and Asia be remedied in a global forum
In the middle of a financial crisis the only thing worse than doubt is false certainty
The paradox is that the ECB could have secured its independence by cutting interest rates on September  and again on October 
Now it will be forced to do so
A victim of its backwardlooking bias the ECB chose to wait for the worst instead of preventing it
As a result the inevitable European rate cut when it comes will probably not have the stabilizing effect that it should
The Folklore of Buried Memories
How victims remember trauma is the most controversial issue facing psychology and psychiatry today
Many clinical trauma theorists believe that combat rape and other terrifying experiences are seemingly engraved on the mind never to be forgotten
Others disagree arguing that the mind can protect itself by banishing memories of trauma from awareness making it difficult for victims to remember their most horrific experiences until it is safe to do so many years later
While acknowledging that trauma is often all too memorable these certain clinical trauma theorists assert that a condition known as raumatic dissociative amnesia leaves a large minority of victims unable to recall their trauma precisely because it was so overwhelmingly terrifying
However these clinical trauma theorists do not argue that epressed or issociated memories of horrific events are either inert or benign
On the contrary these buried memories silently poison the lives of victims giving rise to seemingly inexplicable psychiatric symptoms and therefore must be exhumed for healing to occur
This is no ordinary academic debate
The controversy has spilled out of the psychology laboratories and psychiatric clinics capturing headlines motivating legislative changes and affecting outcomes in civil lawsuits and criminal trials
Whether individuals can repress and recover memories of traumatic sexual abuse has been especially contentious
During the  many adult psychotherapy patients began to recall having been sexually abused during childhood
Some took legal action against the alleged perpetrators often their elderly parents
While complaints against parents based on allegedly repressed and recovered memories of abuse have declined those against large institutions such as the Catholic Church have increased
Strikingly both advocates and skeptics of the concept of traumatic dissociative amnesia adduce the same studies when defending their diametrically opposed views
But it is the advocates who misinterpret the data when attempting to show that victims are often unable to recall their traumatic experiences
Consider the following
After exposure to extreme stress some victims report difficulties remembering things in everyday life
Advocates of traumatic amnesia misconstrue these reports as showing that victims are unable to remember the horrific event itself
In reality this memory problem concerns ordinary absentmindedness that emerges in the wake of trauma it does not refer to an inability to remember the trauma itself
Ordinary forgetfulness that emerges after a trauma must not be confused with amnesia for the trauma
Consider too that one symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder is an nability to recall an important aspect of the trauma
This symptom however does not mean that victims are unaware of having been traumatized
Indeed the mind does not operate like a video recorder and thus not every aspect of a traumatic experience gets encoded into memory in the first place
High levels of emotional arousal often result in the victim attention being drawn to the central features of the event at the expense of other features
Incomplete encoding of a trauma must not be confused with amnesia  an inability to recall something did get into memory
Moreover a rare syndrome called sychogenic amnesia is sometimes confused with traumatic amnesia
Victims of psychogenic amnesia suddenly lose all memory of their previous lives including their sense of personal identity
Occasionally this sudden complete memory loss occurs after severe stress but not invariably
After a few days or weeks memory abruptly returns
In contrast the phenomenon of dissociative amnesia supposedly entails victims inability to remember their traumatic experiences not an inability to remember their entire lives or who they are
Several surveys show that adults reporting childhood sexual abuse often say that there was a period of time when they ould not remember their abuse
Claims of prior inability to remember imply that they had attempted unsuccessfully to recall their abuse only to remember it much later
Yet if these individuals were unable to remember their abuse on what basis would they attempt to recall it in the first place
Most likely they meant that there was a period of time when they did not think about their abuse
But not thinking about something is not the same thing as being unable to remember it
It is inability to remember that constitutes amnesia
Research conducted in my laboratory on adults reporting histories of childhood sexual abuse provides a solution to this bitter controversy
Some of our participants reported having forgotten episodes of nonviolent sexual abuse perpetrated by a trusted adult
They described it as having been upsetting confusing and disturbing but not traumatic in the sense of being overwhelmingly terrifying
Failing to understand what had happened to them they simply did not think about it for many years
When reminders prompted recollection many years later they experienced intense distress finally understanding their abuse from the perspective of an adult
These cases count as recovered memories of sexual abuse but not as instances of traumatic dissociative amnesia
That is the events were not experienced as traumatic when they occurred and there is no evidence that they were inaccessible during the years when they never came to mind
Sexual abuse is not invariably traumatic in the sense of being overwhelmingly terrifying
Of course it is always morally reprehensible even when it fails to produce lasting psychiatric symptoms
Egypt Democracy in Reverse
NEW DELHI  Egypt has had a long and difficult couple of years
From January   when millions of people poured into the streets to rally against Hosni Mubarak regime to the army recent overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi the country has experienced a fall from euphoria into division and frustration  a pattern that seems to have become an inescapable feature of revolution
Was Egypt democratic transition doomed from the start
Although Egypt revolution followed Tunisia it was the successful overthrow of Mubarak regime that gave rise to the moniker rab Spring
But despite the country ostensible progress from Mubarak militarybacked dictatorship to Morsi democratically elected government it appears that not much has changed
Indeed the army is now suppressing another eople revolt  this time by supporters of Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood
With Egypt military restoring its grip on power the country hopedfor political renaissance is slipping from view
Although plans for a new constitution and fresh elections in the next six months have been announced the waywardness of the coup aftermath  reflected in the death of more than  protesters and the arrest of hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood supporters and their leaders  calls into question a democratic future
External factors further undermine Egypt democratic prospects  and those of the Arab Spring countries that have viewed Egypt as a model
The brutal suppression of popular rebellion in Syria by President Bashar alAssad Bathist government raises doubts that Arab countries will soon escape their legacy of oppressive leadership
On the contrary the deepening in recent years of the longstanding SunniShia schism throughout the Muslim world heralds further violence
Given that the outcome of Egypt transition will have farreaching consequences in the region the country is under pressure from all sides
Saudi Arabia for example has embraced the military takeover granting together with the United Arab Emirates  billion in immediate aid
As the Israeli novelist and essayist David Goldman put it Egypt future now epends on what happens in the royal palace at Riyadh not in Tahrir Square
Saudi Arabian commentators have lauded General Abdul Fattah alSisi the head of Egypt military
Asharq alAwsat Hussein Shobokshi wrote od has endowed alSisi with the Egyptians love declaring that alSisi brought rue legitimacy to Egyptfter a period of pointlessness immaturity and distress
Others speculated that had the Muslim Brotherhood remained in office Egypt would have become orth Korea on the Nile
Saudi Arabia involvement in Egypt suggests that a new panArab fault line may be emerging parallel to the ShiaSunni one with the Muslim Brotherhood on one side and the Sunni monarchies and secular military regimes on the other
If so Egypt democratic prospects have not just dimmed they have most likely been eliminated entirely
This uncertainty may partly explain America hesitation to make any definitive policy decisions regarding Egypt
So far the United States has refused to call Morsi overthrow a oup  thereby avoiding the domestic legal obligation to discontinue economic and military assistance while President Barack Obama administration examines its options
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney explained that America relationship with Egypt s bound up in America support for the aspirations of the Egyptian people for democracy for a better economic and political future
Translation Any decision regarding US policy toward Egypt will be informed by US foreignpolicy objectives Congress and US law
But by continuing to provide aid to Egypt while neglecting to impose any concrete demands on Egypt new military leadership the US has tacitly accepted the coup which has made Egypt appear like a anana republic
Such an image cannot be useful in creating the kind of stable and outwardlooking Egypt that the US wants as a cornerstone for regional stability
Given the fragility of the Egyptian military position and the ambiguity of US policy in Egypt the Muslim Brotherhood may now choose to wait patiently for an opportunity to regain control of Egypt government
But its commitment to democratic principles may be seriously weakened
One hopes that a recent comment by the deputy head of the Muslim Brotherhood political wing  o you know how many people died building the pyramids
How many died digging the Suez Canal  does not reflect the Brotherhood willingness to accept the most extreme levels of sacrifice in order to achieve its goals
The stakes could not be higher for Egypt
Sheik Ahmed elTayeb the grand imam of Cairo AlAzhar Mosque the main seat of learning for Sunni Muslims worldwide has warned of an impending civil war
Whether elTayeb is proved right depends on who has the final say in Egypt transition the military the Muslim Brotherhood or a political force like the Salafist Al Nour party which gained onequarter of the vote in the last election and supported the military overthrow of Morsi
Democracy is by definition the first casualty of Morsi downfall
The question now is whether the social rifts that the coup has opened  in Egypt and the wider Arab world  will become too deep to be bridged by any democratic path in the foreseeable future
The Forgotten Genocide
NEW DELHI  It is exactly  years since the Pakistani military regime of Yahya Khan initiated peration Searchlight in March 
That military expedition was but the latest in a series of pogroms carried out to intimidate the restive population of what was then called East Pakistan  today independent Bangladesh
What followed was one of the worst massacres in human history now all but forgotten by the international community
Pakistan was created by the partition of British India in  but its territory was divided into two enclaves separated by hundreds of miles
While they shared a religion Islam there were major cultural and linguistic differences between East and West Pakistan
In the east there was a strong sense of being Bengali and a sizeable Hindu minority continued to live in the province
There was moreover strong resentment that political power lay in the hands of westernbased politicians and generals who were blatantly insensitive to Bengali demands
It seemed to many that with the creation of Pakistan East Pakistan had merely exchanged one form of colonialism for another
And as Bengali demands for autonomy gained momentum the response became more repressive
In November  tropical cyclone hola struck East Pakistan killing between  and  people
Bhola is still considered one of the worst natural disasters on record and the military dictatorship lukewarm relief efforts incensed the Bengali population
So when Pakistan military leaders finally allowed elections in late December  East Pakistan voted overwhelmingly for the Bengalinationalist Awami League which won  of  seats in the province
Since East Pakistan was more populous than West Pakistan the election outcome raised the prospect that the Bengalis would now rule the country as whole
This was not palatable to the Punjabidominated military brass or to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto the leader of West Pakistan largest political party
The elections were anceled and East Pakistan erupted in open revolt
Yahya Khan responded by sending in the troops
The result was a genocide in which as many as three million people particularly minorities and intellectuals were killed
Dhaka University residential halls were particularly targeted
Up to  students were killed in a single attack on Jagannath Hall
Several wellknown professors both Hindu and Muslim were murdered
Hundreds of thousands of women were systematically raped in the countryside
By September  ten million refugees had poured into eastern India
The world knew what was happening
Time magazine August   issue quoted a United States official saying his is the most incredible calculated thing since the days of the Nazis in Poland
The article goes on to describe the streams of refugees
ver the rivers and down the highways and along countless jungle paths the population of East Pakistan continues to hemorrhage into India an endless unorganized flow of refugees with a few tin kettles cardboard boxes and ragged clothes piled on their heads carrying their sick children and their old
They pad along barefooted with the mud sucking at their heels in the wet parts
They are silent except for a child whimpering now and then but their faces tell the story
Many are sick and covered with sores
Others have cholera and when they die by the roadside there is no one to bury them
The international community response to the massacres was shameful
We now have copies of desperate cables sent by diplomat Archer Blood and his colleagues at the US consulate in Dacca now Dhaka pleading with the US government to stop supporting a military regime that was carrying out genocide
Instead President Richard Nixon concentrated on intimidating Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi into staying out
He would even send the US Seventh Fleet to cow her
Fortunately Gandhi held her nerve and began to prepare for war
Strengthened by promises of support from the US and China Pakistan military commanders ordered preemptive air strikes against India on December  
The Indian response was swift and sharp
With support from the civilian population as well as from the Mukti Bahini an irregular army of Bengali rebels the Indian army swept into East Pakistan
Nixon was too bogged down in Vietnam to do more than issue threats
On December  the Pakistanis signed the instrument of surrender in Dacca
Bangladesh was born
Having acquiesced in the genocide the international community has conveniently forgotten it and no Pakistani official has ever been brought to justice
On the contrary many of the perpetrators later held senior government positions
It is as if the Nuremberg trials never happened after WWII
As the world watches Libya Muammar elQaddafi slaughter his own people we should remember the human cost of international indifference
The Forgotten Half of the African Sky
NAIROBI  In Kenya my home country there is a popular saying that when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers
Nowhere is that more evident than in the numerous conflicts Africa has seen in the past  years
In the Democratic Republic of Congo marauding gangs purporting to be freedom fighters and the government armies they fight have for decades used rape as a weapon against defenseless women
Following the end of the Rwandan genocide the heavy burden of rebuilding a devastated society was borne by the countrys women
Yet when it comes to efforts to avert such crises African women often get left out
Consider the African Unions current efforts to find a solution to the postelection political impasse in Cte dIvoire
Of the five African leaders picked at the AU summit in Addis Ababa Ethiopia to coordinate negotiations not one was a woman
What is even more insulting to African women is that the AU bypassed them to pick men whose commitment to democracy and human rights may be worse than that of Laurent Gbagbo the man clinging to the Ivorian presidency despite losing the election
Of the five men appointed to lead the mission to persuade Gbagbo to step down only two  Jakaya Kikwete of Tanzania and South Africas Jacob Zuma  can claim to have come to power democratically
The remaining three Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz of Mauritania Idriss Dby of Chad and Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso grabbed power in coups some of them violent
The irony runs even deeper
The AU is filled with still more men who are no more righteous than Gbagbo
Meles Zenawi who hosted the summit has ruled Ethiopia for nearly  years and has convinced no one outside his circle of cronies that his countrys elections have been free and fair
Even Nigerias Goodluck Jonathan who heads the Economic Community of West African States ECOWAS and supports military intervention against Gbagbo cannot escape such scrutiny unscathed
Jonathan is President of Nigeria today because Umaru Musa YarAdua his deceased predecessor came to power through what many consider rigged elections
And what would Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga say if Gbagbo asks him why he  unlike Alassane Ouatarra whom the AU recognizes as Cte dIvoires rightful president  accepted a powersharing agreement after a  disputed presidential election
As long as Africa is full of such dubious men applying frican solutions to African problems as they like to say will do the continent no good
I know that many would argue that the pool of wellknown African women is limited to Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf Nobel Peace Laureate Wangari Maathai Ngozi OkonjoIweala the former Nigerian minister of finance and current World Bank vice president Graa Machel the former First Lady of Mozambique and South Africa and a few others
They might be right but any of those four women would be more effective at mediating conflicts in Africa than all the presidents of AU countries combined
The trouble with Africa is that the highestranking government officials often do not have the best solutions
In many cases lowerranking officials or even someone outside government might be more effective
Sometimes what Africa needs is more common sense and people who  unlike Africans powerful ig Men  are willing to set aside their pride and ask simple questions that others dont want to face
A woman at the Addis Ababa summit might have asked those calling for war for example to explain how given their failure to control poorly armed militias in Somalia the Democratic Republic of Congo Uganda and elsewhere they planned to defeat Gbagbo
A woman might have reminded those threatening Gbagbo with war that when the conflict begins men will take the fight into the jungle leaving women behind to take care of children
It is women who will then have to pack what little they have and flee to neighboring countries that are already struggling to feed their own children
And it is women who will be raped maimed and killed as the world saw recently in Abidjan the capital of Cte dIvoire when Gbagbo forces massacred seven women during a peaceful protest
Had women been in charge of the AU they would have known that the machismo of African men doesnt allow them to be shaken by threats of violent confrontation
A woman wouldnt have said to Gbagbo tep down or face war
Instead Graa Machel might have started by telling him about how happy her husband Nelson Mandela has been in retirement
Wangari Maathai might have told Gbagbo about former African leaders like Daniel arap Moi of Kenya who despite a bad human rights records while in office was forgiven because he chose to respect the will of the people
As Thomas Sankara the man Compaore overthrew in  to become President of Burkina Faso omen hold up the other half of the sky
Unfortunately the men of the AU have marginalized us and the sky in Cte dIvoire is about to come crashing down again
The Forgotten Sick
LIVERPOOL  The developed world is familiar with the global threats of viral infections that incite fear in both rich populations and poor
The pandemics of SARS avian and swine influenza have cost the global economy an estimated  billion
These threats emerge frequently and unpredictably from human contact with animals
Rapid response is required of governments United Nations agencies regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry for coordination surveillance and vaccine production
But the poorest people  those who live on less than  per day  are often not considered important when a pandemic threat emerges
They do not contribute significantly to the global economy and their countries health systems function on a tiny fraction of what advanced economies devote to their populations health
Conversely the developed countries view of the diseases of the developing world is that only three are important AIDS tuberculosis and malaria
This stems from the power of advocacy constituencies and the recognition that these diseases might threaten the developed world
As a result these diseases receive a disproportionate amount of funding for research and control while other infections kill blind deform and disable many more  the ottom billion  who have little access to health care
These infections are known as the Neglected Tropical Diseases NTDs
They are unfamiliar to the developed world and their names are often difficult to pronounce filariasis elephantiasis onchocerciasis river blindness schistosomiasis bilharzia and others particularly intestinal worms
These are not familiar diseases to people lucky enough to live in the world richest countries but they are household names to hundreds of millions of poor people who are often infected with more than one of them
They are longlasting conditions often contracted at an early age and both the illnesses and their symptoms are progressive
Indeed whereas the misery that worm diseases cause is extensive and the burden excessive  as much as tuberculosis or malaria  they do not kill immediately
Instead they gradually erode children development prospects
And symptoms accumulate sight is gradually lost genital lesions appear around puberty sometimes increasing risk of HIV and skin condition declines as millions of microscopic worms become intolerably itchy
Blood loss causing anemia is the result of thousands of worms chewing at the wall of the gut
Other diseases such as sleeping sickness transmitted by tsetse flies are fatal if untreated as is leishmaniasis if the parasites that cause it  transmitted by tiny sandflies  invade the liver and spleen
Again the misery caused by these infections exceeds the burden of tuberculosis or malaria
The good news is that NTDs can be treated as quality drugs  donated by the major pharmaceutical companies  are made available
These drug donations for river blindness trachoma another blinding disease leprosy elephantiasis worms and bilharzia as well as for sleeping sickness give hope to millions
Moreover the cost of the annual treatment recommended by the World Health Organization is often less than  and much less in Asia with delivery carried out by communities or through schools
The increase in treatment has been spectacular  more than  million people in  countries treated for elephantiasis in  and  million in  countries have been treated for river blindness
Guinea disease is now endemic in only four countries and leprosy is a problem in only six
These are impressive figures and the expense is trivial compared to the antiretroviral drugs needed to treat AIDS which cost more than  annually and must be taken every day not every year
Given that roughly one billion people are infected with NTDs compared to  million with HIV and that the drugs targeting them are donated and actually prevent disease and stop transmission treating NTDs is a major opportunity to lift populations out of poverty
The main challenge is to convince policymakers that there is more to reducing poverty than focusing on just three diseases
In fact NTDs are owhanging fruit
If the international community is serious about alleviating poverty and achieving development goals tackling the diseases so directly associated with economic misery should be a fundamental objective
We can easily meet that objective because we have drugs that are effective free or very cheap that have low delivery costs and that provide addon benefits
Now is the time to rethink our publichealth investments and messaging and evaluate whether we are getting the best value for our donor dollars or whether we should do much more to tackle diseases that we have so far largely ignored
The Forgotten Side of the War on Terrorism
During the past decade  particularly since the September   attacks on the United States  Westerners have generally considered international terrorism to be the most urgent threat to human security
Accordingly vast resources have been mobilized and expended to counter its many forms
Unfortunately however the USled invasion of Afghanistan and the subsequent invasion  without UN authority  of Iraq underscore the primacy of military solutions in the strategic thinking of affluent nations
At the same time developing countries have continued to grapple with the persistence of mass poverty endemic disease malnutrition environmental degradation and gross income inequity all of which have caused a degree of human suffering that far exceeds what has been caused by terrorist attacks
We need therefore to revisit today global challenges from a ThirdWorld perspective
Indeed a fundamental lesson of terrorist attacks and insurgencies we now know is that no nation however selfsufficient can afford to remain heedless of whether others sink or swim
For much of the developing world the basic instability of international relations  owing to terrorist strikes guerrilla warfare and the preemptive wars that America threatens on its enemies  is aggravating socioeconomic anxieties and fueling doubts about the benefits of globalization
Certainly we are all beginning to realize how precarious that process is  how easily market mechanisms can be rolled back by cultural resentments stemming from economic exploitation political oppression and social injustice
People in the industrialized countries are already an estimated  times richer per capita than those in the poorest countries
Today onequarter of the world population still lives on the equivalent of less than one US dollar a day and the World Bank says that the daily spending power of  billion people is roughly equal to the price of a hamburger two soft drinks or three candy bars in the West
According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization  million people including  million children under the age of five go to bed hungry each night
Obviously there must be an intensification of efforts to reduce global poverty which has become a breeding ground of resentment envy and despair  hence a ready producer of violence and suicide bombers
The G countries agreement last year to a debt writeoff for the  poorest states   in Africa and two in Latin America  is a splendid but insufficient beginning
The  most indebted countries still find the burden of servicing their collective  trillion in official debt increasingly hard to bear leaving them hard put to finance national programs spelled out by the UN Millennium Development Goals MDG which seek to halve global poverty by 
If we are to close the global gap in personal security and economic wellbeing the community of nations will need to cultivate a new ethos of mutual responsibility
The Philippine government has proposed that half of all scheduled debt payments be withheld for a specified period to be invested in reforestation clean water housing food production primary healthcare sanitation basic education farmtomarket roads ecologically sound tourism microfinance and related MDG projects
For lenders debt could be converted wherever possible into equity in MDG projects with earning potential while building up poor countries capacity for selfreliance
But selfreliance will be impossible to achieve as long as the rich countries favor free markets and free trade only when it suits them
Even UN SecretaryGeneral Kofi Annan has warned that the unrestrained tide of globalization might not raise all boats but only the yachts  while overturning a lot of canoes
The most glaring injustice in this respect has been the failure of the US and the European Union to deliver substantially on their promises of market access to agricultural exports from poor countries
Bimal Ghosh a former director of the UN Development Program famously calculated that the daily subsidy for every cow in the EU  currently amounting to   exceeds the daily income of millions of poor people around the world
The poor countries argue that broader liberalization in the EU the US and Japan alone would yield benefits worth up to  billion by 
The G nations and the global alliance that America leads must aim not merely to defeat terrorism
They must address all aspects of human security including people wellbeing and safety in their homes neighborhoods and workplaces
And they must win people allegiance by the power of their values and their ideals  not only by isolating terrorists and extremists but also by helping in meaningful ways poor countries to prosper
Above all those who lead us today must create a genuinely new global order in which all peoples take part  with dignity and an assurance of fairness
The Forgotten TwentiethCentury
BERLIN  It has been  years since the dissolution of the Soviet Union which for many historians marked the real end of the hort twentieth century  a century that beginning in  was characterized by protracted ideological conflicts among communism fascism and liberal democracy until the latter seemed to have emerged fully victorious
But something strange happened on the way to the End of History we seem desperate to learn from the recent past but are very unsure about what the lessons are
Clearly all history is contemporary history and what Europeans in particular need to learn today from the twentieth century concerns the power of ideological extremes in dark times  and the peculiar nature of European democracy as it was constructed after World War II
In some ways the great ideological struggles of the twentieth century now seem about as close and relevant as the scholastic debates of the Middle Ages  especially but not only for younger generations
Who now remotely understands  let alone takes the trouble to try to understand  the great political dramas of intellectuals like Arthur Koestler and Victor Serge people who risked their lives for and then against communism
Nevertheless much more than most of us would care to admit we remain enmeshed in the concepts and categories of the twentieth century ideological wars
This was most obvious with the intellectual responses to Islamist terror terms like slamofascism or hird totalitarianism were coined not just to characterize a new enemy of the West but also to evoke the experience of the antitotalitarian struggles that preceded and followed World War II
Such terms seek to borrow legitimacy from the past and to explain the present  in a way that most serious scholars of either Islam or terrorism never found very helpful
Analogizing in this way seemed more to reflect a desire to refight the old battles rather than to sharpen political judgment about contemporary events
So how should we think about the ideological legacy of the twentieth century
For one thing we need to stop viewing the twentieth century as a historical parenthesis filled with pathological experiments conducted by crazed thinkers and politicians as if liberal democracy had been there before those experiments and merely needed to be revived after they failed
It is not a pleasant thought  and perhaps even a dangerous one  but the fact remains that many people not just ideologues put their hopes in the twentieth century authoritarian and totalitarian experiments viewing politicians like Mussolini and even Stalin as problemsolvers while liberal democrats were written off as dithering failures
This is not to make any excuses  it is not true that to comprehend is to forgive
On the contrary any proper understanding of ideologies must reckon with their power to seduce and even genuinely convince people who care little about their emotional appeal  whether to pride or to hate  but who think they actually offer rational policy solutions
We must remember that Mussolini and Hitler were ultimately brought to power by a king and a retired general respectively  in other words traditional elites not streetfighting fanatics
Second we need to appreciate the special and innovative nature of the democracy created by Western European elites after 
In light of the totalitarian experience they stopped identifying democracy with parliamentary sovereignty  the classic interpretation of modern representative democracy everywhere but in the United States
Never again should a parliamentary assembly just cede power to a Hitler or a Ptain
Instead the architects of postwar European democracy opted for as many checks and balances as possible  and paradoxically for empowering unelected institutions to strengthen liberal democracy as a whole
The most important example is constitutional courts  a different animal from the US Supreme Court and one specifically tasked with ensuring respect for individual rights
Eventually even countries traditionally suspicious of overnment by judges  France being the classic case  accepted this model of constrained democracy
And virtually all Central and Eastern European countries adopted it after 
Importantly European institutions  especially the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights  also fit this understanding of democracy through prima facie undemocratic mechanisms
Today many Europeans are clearly dissatisfied with this conception of democracy
Many have the impression that the continent is entering what the political scientist Colin Crouch has called a ostdemocratic era
Citizens increasingly claim that political elites do not properly represent them and that directly elected institutions  national parliaments in particular  are forced to bow to unelected bodies like central banks
Passionate grassroots protest and surging populist parties across the continent are the result
It will not do simply to reaffirm the postwar European model of democracy as if the only alternative were totalitarianism of one sort or another
But we should be clear about where we are coming from and why  and that there was no golden age of European liberal democracy whether before World War II in the  or at some other mythical point
Ordinary Europeans long trusted elites with the business of democracy  and often even seemed to prefer unelected elites
If they now want to modify the social contract and assuming that direct democracy remains impossible change ought to be based on a clear historically grounded sense of which innovations European democracy might really need  and of whom Europeans really trust to hold power
That discussion has barely begun
The Forgotten Virtues of Free Trade
LONDON  aissezfaire French President Nicolas Sarkozy recently declared s finished Perhaps but should we really be satisfied if he is right
If laissezfaire has run its course what will possibly replace it as the foundation of an open global society
Now more than ever it is worth remembering that the last great financial crash not only inspired the New Deal in the United States but also plunged the world into a new dark age of economic nationalism and imperialism
Free trade is far from perfect but the alternatives are worse
Protectionism is bad for wealth bad for democracy and bad for peace
Yet a new wave of protectionism is a genuine danger
Barack Obama appealing to swelling protectionist sentiment among Americans threatened during his presidential campaign to rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement unilaterally
This July the World Trade Organization Doha trade round fell to pieces partly because the US refused to lower its agricultural subsidies
The world is on a slippery slope toward nationalism and exclusion
If a government can step in to bail out failing banks why not to protect its failing businesses or farmers as well
We need a new deal for trade
There is now widespread talk of a retton Woods II that would restructure global finance promote sustainability and offer developing countries id for trade
But to be effective any new deal to promote trade must involve more than a new set of international institutions
It requires democratic reform from the bottom up
In fact this requirement is rooted in history
We have become so accustomed to thinking of free trade as a specialist matter for liberal economists and trade negotiators in dark suits that we forget how a century ago free trade was a core belief for many democrats radicals women activists and indeed organized labor
Back then Britain was in a position not unlike that of the US today a superpower in relative decline facing new competitors and a backlash against globalization
In the late nineteenth century all powers raised their trade barriers  except Britain
Britain stance holds lessons for today
Most economists stress the superiority of the freetrade model and point to the power of lobbies and interest groups to explain its unpopularity in practice
As US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has argued trade expansion inevitably creates some losers whose protests distract attention from the benefits of globalization
This is true but it is only half the story for it ignores how at crucial moments in history free trade has mustered the support of the many winners
A century ago during an earlier crisis of globalization the demand for free trade in Britain inspired a genuine mass movement
It was not just a cause dear to bankers merchants or the young John Maynard Keynes
It mobilized millions of people
For women who remained disenfranchised free trade was a kind of substitute citizenship parliament safeguarded their interests as consumers by keeping the door open for cheap imports
For many democrats it was a force for peace and social justice minimizing the power of special interests and teaching citizens about fairness and international understanding
We should not romanticize this earlier era of free trade
Poverty did not vanish
Many British people believed in a ree Trade Empire
Others fanned the flames of AngloGerman antagonism caricaturing protectionist Germany as a barbarian society surviving on horse sausages and dogmeat Lloyd George the future prime minister told audiences that he was more afraid of the German sausage than he was of the German navy
One reason that free trade defeated protectionism in Britain a century ago was that its supporters appealed to people emotions and identities not just their rational interest in more wealth and cheap food
Liberals and radicals organized traveling shows color posters and political entertainment
In towns displays in shop windows illustrated the costs of tariffs to ordinary consumers
In the countryside people watched political slide shows late into the night
Meetings in seaside resorts reached almost a million people in 
When was the last time you went to the beach and found yourself pulled into a debate about tariffs
The First World War and the  shattered any nave belief in pure free trade
Like today consumers discovered that markets could leave them helpless leading to calls for regulation
Internationalists had to come to terms with the simple fact that on its own trade did not automatically enable peace
Economic globalization had outpaced politics creating new tensions over oil and other strategic resources
Political institutions needed to catch up
Bretton Woods and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade created a new order after the Second World War
In economic terms they have had considerable success
Tariffs have fallen although nontariff barriers and preferential agreements have been on the rise
But in terms of democratic culture GATT also led to a further separation of trade from everyday politics
This is why free trade has been left so defenseless in the face of antiglobalization protests
The good news is that people have not stopped caring about the ethics of trade
On the contrary they have switched to other movements like fair trade and trade justice
To be fair the WTO under Pascal Lamy has tried to reach out to such groups
Still there is a long way to go to reconnect freer trade with citizenship and global solidarity
History shows that doing so is both possible and necessary
The FortyYear Palestinian Tragedy
Forty years ago Israel captured the West Bank Gaza and the Golan Heights after a lightning sixday war that repelled the armies of Egypt Jordan and Syria
Today ending the occupation of Palestinian territories that began that June seems as distant a dream as ever
The Somalialike chaos and civil war that is now unfolding in Gaza as a result of this decadesold stalemate can be blamed partly on illconceived Israeli policies and partly on an American administration that for six long years relegated the cause of IsraeliPalestinian peace to the bottom of its agenda
But it is misleading to attribute the failure of the Palestinians to develop an orderly system of selfgovernment only to the pernicious effects of Israeli occupation and American policies
The Palestinian crisis is first and foremost one of leadership
True Yasser Arafat was not a model democrat but his charisma and political acumen were crucial for holding all the Palestinian factions together
Now not even Fatah Arafat own party can claim to be a coherent organization
Hamas electoral victory in January  was to a large extent due to Fatah fragmentation under Arafat successor Mahmoud Abbas
With no effective central authority to inspire fear or respect and the PLO devoid of legitimacy precisely because of its refusal to give Hamas its rightful share in the organization a grotesquely ineffective brand of ohabitation between a Fatah president and a Hamas prime minister has emerged
As a result Palestinian politics has degenerated into a naked struggle for the spoils of power
Last February Mecca agreement which created the FatahHamas unity government was supposed to establish a civilized system of powersharing
But that deal now appears to be collapsing
The current flareup is largely due to the fact that Fatah encouraged by the international community boycott of Hamas never really accepted its electoral defeat and Hamas right to govern
Moreover since Hamas rise to power Fatah challenge to the new Palestinian rulers was enhanced by lavish financial support it secured from the United States and Europe and by a generous supply of weapons from both the US and Arab countries
Thus the current conflict is essentially a preemptive war by Hamas  aggravated by lawlessness and banditry clashing freelance militias tribes and families and a spiral of senseless massacres  to prevent Fatah from being turned by the international community into a formidable challenger to its democratic right to govern
For Hamas this is a lifeanddeath struggle
It has not shrunk from bombarding Abbas presidential compound attacking Fatah command centers and targeting Fatah military leaders like Rashid Abu Shbak the commander of Fatah internal security and many others all of them lieutenants of the supreme Fatah military authority in the Gaza strip Mohamed Dahlan
Hamas determination to assert its authority can be gauged by the desecrated corpses of Fatah fighters many of them with bullets fired at their heads a practice dubbed onfirmation of death
The rocket attacks against Israeli territory are a transparent attempt to divert attention and rally the masses around Hamas as the true champions of the Palestinian cause
Tragically all this is not only about human victims but also about the Palestinians political horizon
Three times in their history  in  and   the Palestinians were offered a state and three times their leaders failed to meet the challenge  admittedly never an easy one for a nation built on such an unwavering ethos of dispossession
Today when America finally understands how vital an IsraeliPalestinian peace is for its fortunes in the broader Middle East and the Arab world is for the first time committed to pursuing a comprehensive settlement with Israel anarchic Palestinian politics is making a decision for peace well nigh impossible
However vibrant Israel democracy is not exactly manageable or predictable either
But although Prime Minister Ehud Olmert might seek to regain his popular credibility by a major new peace demarche the twoheaded Palestinian Authority always a dubious partner in the eyes of the Israelis is now more suspect than ever
very day that goes by only causes more people to wish for the renewal of the Israeli occupation of Gaza
Let the Jews come already and save us
But that despairing hope uttered by a desperate Gazan will not materialize
Israel will avoid at all costs a large ground incursion
Yet engaged in a war driven by fury and vengeance the Israelis are now focused again on a manhunt for gang chieftains targeted killings of Hamas squads and the arrest of its political leaders not on peace overtures
Only a dramatic move by external powers can still save Gaza from becoming a second Mogadishu and both Palestinians and Israelis from a total war that would only breed more rage and desperation
For the building blocks of a renewed peace process to be sustainable an international force must be deployed along Gaza border with Egypt to prevent the constant smuggling of weapons and isolate the conflict
Simultaneously the international community must help make the unity government work by recognizing Hamas right to govern in exchange for a performancebased stability plan
The Fountain of Youth Revealed
Since the dawn of human consciousness we have contemplated our own mortality and dreamed of ways of overcoming it
Until recently achieving control over our own longevity was the stuff of fairy tales disconnected from actual scientific progress
But new research suggests that the molecular basis of aging may soon be understood in detail
Applying this knowledge could be close behind 
Recent scientific breakthroughs have come from research not on humans or even on rats and mice but on simple laboratory organisms like yeast and roundworms
These primitive life forms have yielded important generally valid clues that have forced a comprehensive reevaluation of the nature of the aging process 
Traditional evolutionary thought views aging as a process that occurs by default in the postreproductive phase of life
After all Darwinian natural selection cannot prevent the wholesale decline of an individual whose genes have already been passed on to the next generation
According to this view many cellular and organic processes thus degrade concurrently and aging has many causes
As a result the postreproductive shortcomings of a great many genes would have to be remedied to slow the aging process 
Recent research on yeast and roundworms suggests otherwise
It turns out that mutations even in single genes can lead to a substantial lengthening of life span and an accompanying slowdown in the aging process 
But how can this be possible if aging has many concurrent causes as evolutionary theory maintains 
The answer can be found by examining the molecules that make up the genes in which mutations extend life span
For example a universal gene called SIR determines the life span of both yeast cells and roundworms
In both organisms if an extra copy of SIR is added by genetic intervention the life span is extended
Conversely if the SIR gene is deleted the life span is shortened 
In both yeast and worms SIR appears to sense the availability of food and stall the aging process in times of deprivation by stimulating the formation of specialized body typesspores in yeast and dauers in wormsthat can survive for extraordinarily long periods without nutrition
When conditions improve the dormant life forms revive and reproduce
The survival function that SIR exists to serveforestalling aging and reproduction during famineis adaptive and therefore pervasive in nature 
So the classical evolutionary theory of aging must be modified
In times of plenty the aging process plays out as evolutionary biologists say with reproduction followed by the failure of many genes and a wholesale decline of individual organisms
But in times of scarcity the survival program kicks in to slow the aging process
Even more intriguingly a single gene can promote this survival mechanism across a wide swath of natures creatures 
Does SIR also promote survival in mammals
Interestingly in cultured mouse or human cells the mammalian SIR gene determines a cells response to DNA damage
When faced with damaging agents cells have the ability to commit suicide
The mammalian SIR gene modulates this process and higher levels of it dampen the cell death response
Just like in yeast and worms mammalian SIR promotes survival in this case of cultured cells 
Does this mean that mammalian aging is at least partly caused by the gradual loss of cells and the accompanying failure of organs
Possibly but we must bear in mind that the cell death response is a way to cull genetically damaged cells before they progress into tumors
So increasing SIR activity in mammals may actually cause cancer by keeping bad cells alive too long 
Yet this seems unlikely for two reasons
First as an evolutionary matter it makes little sense that a gene anointed by nature to promote survival would also cause cancer
Second recent experiments in genetically altered mice show that the cell death response may be slowed without causing cancer
This suggests that there is a window of slowing cell death that does not cause cancer and may promote longevity 
Obviously the practical implications of these findings could prove extraordinary
If single genes can determine the life span of mammals it should be possible to develop drugs that bind to these genes proteins and alter their activities
Thus drugs that slow the aging process could be around the corner 
But will such drugs prolong youth and vitality or simply extend our stay in nursing homes 
To answer this question consider the effects of calorie restriction which has been found to increase life span in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals
In yeast where the process has been studied in molecular detail the longevity triggered by calorie restriction is mediated by SIR
In mammals we have not yet discovered the molecular basis of the longevity
But we do know that restricted animals are vigorous and healthy for the duration of their longer lives 
The Fragile Roots of Productivity Growth
How fast is the US economy now growing
Smart investors are now betting that the most recent economic data will show an annual GDP growth rate of  for the second quarter of 
They are also betting that the current third quarter may well show a growth rate as high as  per year
July saw American industrial production jump by half a percent while Intel the big microprocessor maker is reporting very strong growth in demand for its key products suggesting that business investment spending is finally accelerating
Although Japan continues to stagnate and Western Europe hovers on the edge of recession a solid outputgrowth recovery in the US should prove to be a big help in boosting demand in the rest of the world
But this good news about the US business cycle has been accompanied by bad news about employment
Hours worked in American business fell at a  annual rate in the second quarter
Employmentparticularly manufacturing employmentfell in July
It is very likely that hours worked will continue to fall in the third quarter
What accounts for this wide divergence
How can America see reasonably rapid output growth and yet rising unemployment
The answer is that the underlying trend of productivity growth in the American economy continues to be exceptionally positive
The  annual productivity gain recorded in the second quarter seems likely to be matched in JulySeptember
With Americas workers producing more in less time it is no wonder that a wedge is being driven between the good output news and the bad employment news
In the short run rapid productivity growth poses dilemmas for macroeconomic management because what would otherwise be seen as reasonably strong demand growth is proving to be insufficient to keep unemployment low
But the shortrun view is not the important one
Rapid productivity growth isin the long rungood news for America a higherproductivity economy is better at enhancing human welfare
In the long run this is also good news for Americas trading partners there is more value to be gained by trading with a richer economy than with a poorer one
The continuation of rapid US productivity growth through the recent recession and into the subsequent lowwattage recovery is a very strong piece of evidence that Americas longrun rate of GDP and productivity growth has shifted upward permanently or if not permanently at least for a period of time likely to be measured in decades
America of course is not alone among industrial nations that have seen productivity growth accelerate since the second half of the s
Australia Ireland and the Scandinavian countries all had their own sustained bursts of unexpectedly rapid growth
But the rest of Western Europe and Japan have not
Western Europe and Japan have vibrant hightech sectors able executives and cultures easily as capable as the US of taking advantage of the boom promised by the rapidly falling prices of information technology
So you would think that the same productivity revolution would happen in those countries
Yet there has been no sign of it
Why not
The current conventional wisdom most strongly advocated by the American economist Robert Gordon is that the burst of productivity growth that the US is currently experiencing and that will turn into a fullfledged economic boom whenever demand growth becomes rapid enough is due to synergy
According to this view the US is especially well positioned to benefit from rapidly falling prices of information technology owing to its openness to competition and new ways of doing business particularly in distribution
The comparison between the late s and early s in America and in Western Europe compels us to reflect on how fragile the underlying institutional mechanisms needed to support rapid economic growth truly are
Western Europe and the US are both postindustrial democracies
Both possess market economies
Both have large and powerful social insurance systems
Of course institutional differences between America and Western Europe do exist in the regulation of labor in restrictions on landuse and redevelopment in the tolerance of competition authorities for resale price maintenance and related practices
But are these differences really so large as to affect macroeconomic performance so dramatically
In Robert Gordons estimationand in minethe roots of an economywide hightech productivity boom like the one seen in the US are so delicate that they flourish in American but not in continental European soil
The Fragility of a Flat World
The world is flat
So says the columnist Thomas Friedman who chose that provocative title for his bestselling book to awaken people to the dramatic effects that technology is having on the world economy
Distance is shrinking
Geographical barriers no longer provide easy protection
Manufacturing workers and hightech professionals alike in Europe and America are being challenged by global competition
Western consumers who call a local company are likely to speak to someone in India
Skeptics have pointed to the limits of Friedman metaphor
As one put it the world is not flat but piky
A contour map of economic activity in the world would show mountains of prosperity and many ravines of deprivation
Moreover distance is far from dead
Even neighbors with low tariff barriers like Canada and the United States trade more internally than across borders
Seattle and Vancouver are close geographically but Vancouver trades more with distant Toronto than with nearby Seattle
Such criticism notwithstanding Friedman makes an important point
Globalization which can be defined as interdependence at intercontinental distances is as old as human history
Witness the migration of peoples and religions or trade along the ancient silk route that connected medieval Europe and Asia
But globalization today is different because it is becoming quicker and thicker
After the first transAtlantic cable in  Europe and America could communicate in a minute
In  the economist John Maynard Keynes described the possibility of an Englishman in London using a telephone to order goods from around the world to be delivered to his house by the afternoon
But Keynes Englishman was wealthy and thus exceptional
Today hundreds of millions of people around the world have access to global goods in their local supermarkets
Similarly as recently as two decades ago instantaneous global communication existed but was economically out of reach for most people
Now virtually anyone can enter an Internet caf and enjoy a capability that was once available only to governments multinational corporations and a few individuals or organizations with large budgets
Tremendous declines in computing communication and transport costs have democratized technology
Only a decade ago twothirds of all Internet users were in the US
Today less than a quarter are located there
Knowledge is power and more people have access to information today than at any time in human history
Nonstate actors now have capabilities that were once limited to governments
The nationstate is not about to be replaced as the dominant institution of world politics but it will have to share the stage with more actors including organizations like Oxfam celebrities like Bono and transnational terrorist networks like Al Qaeda
But flattening is reversible
It has happened before
The world economy was highly integrated in  but economic interdependence declined during the next three decades
The global economy did not recover that same level of integration until  and even then it remained divided by the Iron Curtain
World War I was the trigger that set off the reversal with economic globalization declining while military globalization increased as witnessed by two world wars and a global cold war
This reflected deeper problems of domestic inequality created by nineteenthcentury economic progress
Politics did not keep pace and the result was the rise of pathological ideologies  fascism and communism  that divided nations and the world
The creation of the welfare state in Western countries after World War II helped to create a safety net for people disadvantaged by economic change thereby encouraging them to accept the return of international economic interdependence
Some analysts see China playing a role today similar to Germany role in the twentieth century
A rising power beset with internal inequality turns to nationalism and challenges the dominant power provoking a war that turns back the progress of economic globalization
While the American and Chinese economies are highly interdependent today so too were Germany and Britain before 
But the analogy is imperfect
Germany had surpassed Britain in industrial production by 
Even at its current high rates of growth China economy is unlikely to equal that of the US for at least two more decades
The greater threat to a flat world is likely to come from the nonstate and transnational forces that have been unleashed by the diffusion of technology
On September   a nonstate network killed more Americans in a surprise attack than the government of Japan did at Pearl Harbor in 
I have called this the privatization of war
If such actors obtain nuclear and biological materials the world will look very different
Borders will become harder to cross for both people and goods
And if such actors disrupt the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf home to twothirds of the world reserves a global depression like that of the  could strengthen protectionism further
Globalization has two driving forces technology and policy
Thus far policy has reinforced the flattening effects of technology
As the world largest economy the US has taken the lead in promoting policies that reduce barriers
But the events described above could reverse such policies
Some critics of globalization might welcome such an outcome
But the result as we saw after  would be the worst of both worlds  reversal of the economic globalization that spreads technology and power but reinforcement of negative dimensions of military and ecological globalization such as war terror climate change and the spread of infectious diseases
In that case the flat world could become a desert
The French Cul de Sac
PARIS  As France presidential election looms the country is approaching a breaking point
For three decades under both the right and the left the country has pursued the same incompatible if not contradictory goals
With the sovereigndebt crisis pushing French banks nd thus the French economy  to the wall something will have to give and soon
When the crunch comes  almost certainly in the year or two following the election  it will cause radical wrenching change perhaps even more farreaching than Charles de Gaulle coup dat which led to the establishment of the Fifth Republic in 
Most French politicians and bureaucrats call such notions scaremongering
After all aren key indicators like debt ratios or budgetdeficit trends worse in the United States and Britain
Indeed France predicament might seem comparable with the nglo Saxons were it not for the French political class beloved baby the euro
While the euro has not caused France economic problems its politicians commitment to the single currency represents an insurmountable barrier to solving them
The basic problem is that the country supergenerous welfare state public spending amounts to about  of GDP in  compared to  in the United Kingdom and  in Germany stifles the growth needed for the euro to remain viable
The most serious structural flaws concern high payroll taxes and labormarket regulation which make it difficult  or at least prohibitively expensive  for firms to reduce their workforce when business conditions worsen
The OECD reports that in  France ax wedge income taxes plus employee and employer socialsecurity contributions minus cash transfers as a percentage of total labor costs was at least  percentage points above the OECD average at every level of household income
The result has been elevated unit labor costs relative to France peer group especially Germany and stubbornly high unemployment
During Valery Giscard dstaing presidency in the  unemployment rose every year reaching  by 
Franois Mitterrand promised rapid growth and lower unemployment when he came to power in  but presided over an economic slowdown and rising unemployment
By  unemployment reached  and dipped below  in only one year since then 
High unit labor costs and unemployment rates are responsible in turn for reducing the trend rate of economic growth mainly owing to underutilized labor while the combination of lackluster growth and an evermounting welfare burden has resulted in chronic budget deficits
The last surplus was in 
The current election campaign is accordingly centered on France fiscal position
Everyone agrees that deficit reduction is required while differing on how to go about it
Sarkozy proposed cure is to boost growth by reducing the tax burden on employers while simultaneously hiking the rate of valueadded tax
His main opponent Socialist leader Franois Hollande would impose higher taxes mainly on the wealthy and the financial sector but also on big business
With the only effective solutions  fullblown eurozone political union or abandoning the euro  ruled out muddling through is all that is left
Another name for this approach is ransfer union which implies relentless economic austerity and declining living standards because strong countries  first and foremost Germany  are determined to limit their liability for bailing out deficit countries by making all transfers conditional on tough budget retrenchment
At the same time financial markets are forcing fiscal retrenchment on governments as will the planned new fiscal treaty on which Germany among others insisted
Demand is therefore being drained out of the eurozone economies with stronger external demand stemming from the euro depreciation against other major currencies unable to offset the effect on growth
The French government expects budget revenues to match all spending except debt service by 
But that forecast assumes continued growth whereas France is slipping into recession
So the budget deficit will persist and more retrenchment will be required
Will the public grin and bear it or demand a radical change of direction
In the latter scenario the change would be delivered either by a part of the mainstream political class that breaks ranks or through a successful challenge by a political outsider whether National Front leader Marine Le Pen on the right or JeanLuc Mlenchon Left Front
Both parties are campaigning on an antieuro protectionist platform
Sarkozy has adopted a statesmanlike pose as befits the incumbent warning voters of the hard grind to come such as the need to work longer hours for lower hourly pay
But selling to the French public painful structural change as the price to be paid for urope no longer works
Hollande program meanwhile implies that pain can be avoided altogether by loosening European constraints
He has indicated that if elected he would renegotiate the fiscal treaty and seek to alter the statutes of the European Central Bank  perhaps as an early sign of willingness to break with European orthodoxy
He is also promising to emulate his predecessors by bringing Germany around to the French point of view  that is use German fiscal transfers
That way France could hold onto its European project at a lower mediumterm cost to domestic living standards
This is the sort of trick that Hollande mentor Mitterrand was able to pull off
But that was possible not because of Mitterrand superior wiles but rather because France had a stronger position vis  vis Germany than it does today
France response to the tension between preserving the European project equated with the single currency and avoiding a chronically depressed economy will be to put off the day of reckoning for as long as possible
This deadend strategy will feature vain attempts to game Germany and desperate economic expedients such as the essentially coercive capture of domestic savings to finance government debt
But the day of reckoning will come and France ruling establishment will be judged harshly when it does
The French Don Get It
CAMBRIDGE  The French government just doesn seem to understand the real implications of the euro the single currency that France shares with  other European Union countries
French officials have now reacted to the prospect of a credit rating downgrade by lashing out at Britain
The head of the central bank Christian Noyer has argued that the rating agencies should begin by downgrading Britain
The finance minister Francois Baroin recently declared that ou rather be French than British in economic terms
And even the French Prime minister Francois Fillar noted that Britain had higher debt and larger deficits than France
French officials apparently don recognize the importance of the fact that Britain is outside the eurozone and therefore has its own currency which means that there is no risk that Britain will default on its debt
When interest and principal on British government debt come due the British government can always create additional pounds to meet those obligations
By contrast the French government and the French central bank cannot create euros
If investors are unwilling to finance the French budget deficit  that is if France cannot borrow to finance that deficit  France will be forced to default
That is why the market treats French bonds as riskier and demands a higher interest rate even though France budget deficit is  of its GDP whereas Britain budget deficit is  of GDP
There is a second reason why the British situation is less risky than that of France
Britain can reduce its currentaccount deficit by causing the British pound to weaken relative to the dollar and the euro which the French again cannot do without their own currency
Indeed that is precisely what Britain has been doing with its monetary policy bringing the sterlingeuro and sterlingdollar exchange rates down to more competitive levels
The eurozone fiscal deficits and currentaccount deficits are now the most obvious symptoms of the euro failure
But the credit crisis in Europe and the weakness of eurozone banks may be even more important
The persistent unemployment differentials within the eurozone are yet another reflection of the adverse effect of imposing a single currency and a single monetary policy on a heterogeneous group of countries
President Nicolas Sarkozy and other French politicians are no doubt unhappy that the recent European summit failed to advance the cause of further EU political integration
It was French officials Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman who launched the initiative for European political union just after World War II with the call for a United States of Europe
The French regarded the creation of the euro as an important symbol of progress toward that goal
In the  Jacques Delors then the French finance minister pressed for a single currency with a report ne Market One Money which implied that the European freetrade agreement would work only if its members used a single currency
For the French achieving a European political union is a way to increase Europe role in the world and France role within Europe
But that goal looks harder to reach now than it did before the beginning of the European crisis
By attacking Britain and seeking to increase British borrowing costs France is only creating more conflict between itself and Britain while creating more tensions within Europe as a whole
Looking ahead stopping the eurozone financial crisis does not require political union or a commitment of German financial support
It depends on individual eurozone countries  especially Italy Spain and France  making the changes in their domestic spending and taxation that will convince global financial investors that they are moving toward budget surpluses and putting their debttoGDP ratios on a downward path
France should focus its attention on its domestic fiscal problems and the dire situation of its commercial banks rather than lashing out at Britain or calling for political changes that are not going to occur
The French Death Rattle
PARIS  Moody announcement in November that it had downgraded France sovereigncredit rating by one notch from its AAA rating prompted one blogger to poke fun at rating agencies tendency either to get things completely wrong or to recognize suddenly a crisis that had long been staring them in the face
The blogger joked f this recognition by a rating agency that France has problems is an example of the first failing a recovery must have begun if it is an example of the second failing the country faces a dire reckoning
French President Franois Hollande government claims to have awoken to the threat
In a recent interview Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici likened the measures being undertaken to reduce the country debt burden and restore competitiveness to a opernican revolutionbecause these choices were not clear for a French government or for a centerleft government
As proof of this new realism the government has been trumpeting its response to the set of policy recommendations that an expert panel led by the business executive Louis Gallois presented two weeks before the downgrade
The response is centered on a payrolltax cut which will be offset by spending cuts and a higher valueadded tax
In the runup to the downgrade an analyst at Moody said that the decision would be based largely on whether the government heeded the Gallois report call for a ompetitiveness shock to France economy
The downgrade thus suggests that Moody considered the government response insufficient
In fact this negative verdict barely scratches the surface of France predicament
The full picture emerges only after examining the motivations behind the government inadequate response
The underlying explanation lies in the culture and prejudices of France governing elite the socalled grands commis formed by the National Civil Service School of which Hollande  like virtually all of his predecessors except Nicolas Sarkozy  is an alumnus
In this cloistered world a prosperous and just society requires a statedirected economy
This dedication to dirigisme has spawned among the ruling elite a sense of entitlement and hostility to business
Indeed for France political leaders business amounts to a zerosum competition to capture a higher share of total value added for owners and managers at the expense of labor
Criticism of this antibusiness approach is usually dismissed in France as ltraliberal flailing against the ocial model that the French nation has embraced
But the example set by Scandinavian countries which combine a generous welfare state with probusiness policies and traditions repudiates such claims
The main difference between the failing French model and the more successful Scandinavian approach lies not in welfare utputs many public services in France such as the healthcare system remain among the best in the world but in how they are financed
The Scandinavian social compact rests on the understanding that citizens must pay high taxes in exchange for public services
While French public spending  which stood at  of GDP in   is at or above Scandinavian levels French households pay lower tax rates on consumption and personal income
The gap is bridged by a mixture of deficit spending and high taxation on employment
Relentless government borrowing and high payroll taxes employerpaid social security have long sustained citizens illusion that they are getting something for nothing while perpetuating successive governments misconception that taxing business is a painless way of financing welfare and public services
But it is increasingly apparent that this approach has undermined public finances and competitiveness  and that households end up picking up the tab
In fact chronically high unemployment has meant that they have been doing so for years
Now citizens are facing higher taxes and cuts to public services
Defenders of the French system quibble over laborcost statistics in their efforts to prove that France is not so different from its main European trading partners
But the facts of the last decade  including a significant loss of exportmarket share and a ofGDP deterioration in the currentaccount balance  paint a different picture
Moreover this line of defense misses the point
The burden of payroll taxes together with overweening labormarket regulation stifles entrepreneurship
If Hollande tax hikes  on income including a temporary  tax rate for the country wealthiest households dividends capital gains and capital assets  are not enough to deter entrepreneurs the cost of hiring workers and the difficulty of firing them remain powerful disincentives
Far from signifying a probusiness shift Hollande government response to the Gallois report reflects the French elite enduring interventionist mentality
Instead of implementing deep and permanent cuts in payroll taxes on businesses the government will give companies a  billion  billion incometax credit over the next two years
And with companies required to apply the rebated cash to investment and job creation the government has portrayed the measure as a cut in taxes on labor that will boost employment
But a temporary tax break cannot change incentives
Furthermore companies will not receive the cash until  owing to the complexity of France tax administration
And when they do get it the state cannot possibly know that reinvesting in the same enterprise will be more beneficial than say paying out dividends that shareholders could then use to finance a new venture
Once again French lawmakers are acting on the conviction that they know better than market participants
Apart from promises to reduce employment regulation all of the new measures boil down to officials directing state money and subsidies to companies and projects of their choosing
So the death rattle of the French economic model continues
What remains to be seen is how the end will come
And whether it comes in the form of a capital strike by foreign bondholders or of domestic labor strikes and wider social and political unrest France leaders remain entirely unprepared for the inevitable
The French Reactionary Revolution
PARIS  The expression he French exception applies not only to culinary matters but to social and economic issues as well
A majority of today French recognize that raising the retirement age is necessary to ensure the survival of the pension system
Yet according to all publicopinion polls close to  of the French support the demonstrators who are taking to the streets to block the very modest reforms introduced by President Nicolas Sarkozy government
he French exception is the product of an encounter between a peculiar political and intellectual history and the rejection of the elites currently in power
To the dismay of their European neighbors and in front of a bemused global public the French are once again demonstrating their bizarre tradition of using revolutionary means to express extreme conservative leanings
Unlike their predecessors in May  today demonstrators are not in the streets to defend a different and better future
They are out there in significant numbers to protect the status quo and to express their nostalgia for the past and their fear of the future
And yet the reactionaryrevolutionary movement of the type that we are witnessing  a backlash against the inevitable consequences of globalization  remains unmistakably French
It is driven by the extreme Cartesian rationality verging on the absurd of a country whose citizens continue to view their state in the same way that adolescents view their parents
Indeed to see high school students expressing their hostility to Sarkozy planned slight increase in the retirement age is particularly revealing
They seem to confirm the isdom of a Chinese student who recently described her life plan to an American magazine  will start with a good American university to beef up my education then I will work in China and become rich and then I will retire in Europe and enjoy life
If she retires in France she can live in an ideal place to enjoy the present not to build a future
The protesters know that what they are demanding in the streets today  the maintenance of what they have  is totally unrealistic
Yet they find it perfectly legitimate to carry on
And what if France really is showing the world what a ood life is all about that life is not about being part of a reat Nation with a nuclear bomb and a seat on the United Nations Security Council but about being a appy Nation whose citizens understand how to live well and want to enjoy a long econd life after retirement
France in this light becomes once again the spearhead of a new European Revolution  a revolution based not on the principles of ibert Egalit Fraternit but on the pleasure principle
Such Frenchmen want to lead Europeans in their attempt to become a museum of the good life and concentrate on tourism
France must be the model of an alternative
But this ironic vision of today France is much too simplistic or romantic and does not comprehend the combination of fear and social discontent that are now visible in the current French maelstrom
In their desperate pursuit of contentment the French express a profound existential malaise
They seem to be asking f we can no longer be great because we have been overtaken by others can we simply be happy
But their opposition to change reflects not only a certain denial of reality
It also corresponds to a rebuttal of the man who incarnates in their eyes everything they reject
Indeed Sarkozy personal unpopularity plays a significant role in the continuing strength of the antireform opposition
How can a man who represents ig business or who simply seems fascinated by money dare ask them to sacrifice for France
The French passion for equality nowadays far outweighs the French passion for liberty and thus threatens French prosperity
The fate of those who began working at a very early age or of women who interrupted work to raise their children is used as an argument against reform
But that is merely an alibi that allows the French to claim that they have nothing against reform in principle but that the reforms being proposed are riddled with injustice
The outcome is difficult to predict
The battle of wills between Sarkozy and the street is still very much open
If I had to bet I would wager that the government will end up winning this battle
But Sarkozy is unlikely to derive longterm political benefit from his modest success and he will face an uphill battle to be reelected
The French have not yet chosen between defending the old world and facing up to the challenges of a globalized world
Their very hesitation is a source of bewilderment for most and a source of admiration for a few
In all fairness it seems easier to explain than to understand their behavior
The French Socialists New European Identity
The French Socialist Party may well have just saved ratification of the European Union draft Constitutional Treaty by France in next summer referendum
At the beginning of December party members and supporters voted overwhelmingly in favor of the treaty 
With the popularity of President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister JeanPierre Raffarin  and French rightist forces more broadly  in steep decline a o vote could have tipped the public against ratification
But the French Socialists vote is also important for the European Left
The French Socialist Party never had its ggiornamento or ad Godesberg where the German SPD in  renounced its last vestiges of Marxism
Instead the party long defended the theory of a revolutionary upture with capitalism never clearly acknowledging its reformist nature
As a result French Socialists always positioned themselves to the left of their European partners giving a major economic role to the state following the big nationalizations that took place in  after Franois Mitterrand was first elected president
Later it fought against Tony Blair hird Way and Gerhard Schrder ew center in the late 
The party did choose Europe over dogma in  when Mitterrand decided to remain in the European Monetary System
But the party never debated or theorized this choice simply accepting former Prime Minister Lionel Jospin claim that the fiscal stability and financial modernization resulting from the decision was but a arenthesis
That December vote on the EU Constitutional Treaty closed this parenthesis by approving of it the Socialists consciously accepted a reformist social democratic European identity
They have positioned themselves as a great power on the left with a central position in the European Socialist Party offering an alternative to the prescriptions of New Labour and the SPD 
This outcome did not come without a fight
Powerful mainstream Socialists such as former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius joined traditional leftist minorities in the party  either rigidly euroskeptic or unrealistically euromaximalist  to rally around refusal
This stance came as a shock from Fabius a signatory of the Single Act of  a party leader during the Maastricht Treaty negotiations and Finance Minister when France adopted the euro in 
Clearly political calculations played a role Fabius intuitively felt that the French especially those on the left oppose the construction of Europe in its current form and that carrying the banner of rejection could win him the party leadership  and thus its presidential nomination in 
This reasoning proved wrong the Socialists members and voters know that there is no alternative to Europe and accepted the Treaty as a means of going further despite its imperfections
But limiting the significance of the o vote to mere political calculation would be a mistake for it also reflects the importance of the rench malaise about Europe
The French perceive Europe as distant technocratic and often the Trojan horse of liberal globalization and deindustrialization
These doubts are even stronger among those who consider the ideals of a social Europe insufficiently fulfilled owing to the right political dominance control of  of  governments the same number of European commissioners and a majority in the European Parliament
Moreover Lionel Jospin elimination from the presidential election in  by the farright JeanMarie Le Pen is widely interpreted  wrongly in my opinion  as the result of the Socialists proEuropean position
But the Socialist es to Europe should not be confused with the es given by the right
French Socialists support the Constitutional Treaty as a way to strengthen political effectiveness and democratic accountability in the EU and because it advances the cause of social progress by integrating the Charter of Fundamental Rights and defining goals such as full employment sustainable development antidiscrimination and gender equality
The Socialist es also means support for increasing Europe standing as a global power through the creation of an EU ministry of foreign affairs
This doesn amount to a conversion to liberal principles or a substitution of Europe for the ideals of the left and of socialism
The treaty is but a necessary step to successful EU enlargement and further progress on Europe construction it is not an end in itself 
The essential task for the European Socialist Party now is to build a vision for Europe that addresses its constituencies concerns and inspires their hopes
The party cannot evade demands for a more social Europe and for solutions to weak growth and high unemployment
The European Socialists will also have to define a more ambitious budget strategy with higher spending for research education and other social investments develop an industrial policy that transcends the simplistic logic of competitiveness affirm a legal framework for European public services and support greater EUwide social and fiscal homogeneity
There has been progress on all these issues guided by a report entitled or a progressive Europe delivered by Pascal Lamy to the European Socialist Party leader former Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen
But European Socialists remain divided German and British members oppose higher spending and fiscal homogeneity
Clearly the French es did not solve everything
Europe left must still clarify its vision of the future
The internal debates will be heated and their conclusions difficult for some to accept
But I am happy that the French Socialists have made a powerful statement on behalf of the Treaty
The French Way of Crisis
PARIS  France is in disarray
According to opinion polls Nicolas Sarkozy popularity is at the lowest point seen in decades for a French president
Last week two ministers resigned but a parliamentary and mediasustained storm continues fueled by conflictofinterest charges against a minister suspected of corruption when raising money for Sarkozy presidential campaign
Some ministers don care much about public perceptions when using public funds and it is clear that the political atmosphere has become poisonous
The atmosphere in parliament is execrable and may be enough to topple the government in a noconfidence motion
But the constitution established by General Charles de Gaulle is strong and Sarkozy will keep his position until the end of his mandate in 
The main opposition Socialist Party weak electoral prospects are also helping Sarkozy
The size of France political crisis seems to be out of proportion with the country real situation
To be sure France has been severely hit by the global financial crisis and economic downturn
But the consequences have been somewhat less dramatic than in many other European countries
Two of the three Baltic countries and Greece are in deep financial distress
Much the same is true of Portugal Spain Hungary and Iceland
Ireland Belgium Italy and the United Kingdom are still under threat owing to large public debts or currentaccount deficits
But the Netherlands and Austria  and to a lesser extent Germany and France  are faring slightly better
In the short term the situation in Germany is less severe than in France
Its trade balance is positive and total public debt is not as high as it is in other countries
Despite high unemployment and low growth Germany does not face a shortterm threat to macroeconomic stability though the country population is declining and aging implying huge challenges in the decades ahead
The shortterm situation for France is more worrying
The fiscal deficit is higher than  of GDP the trade balance is negative and public debt  albeit lower than in all other European countries except Germany and the Netherlands  is nonetheless  of GDP
France urgently needs structural reforms  and thus a strong government
Of course unethical behavior by officials  the root of the current crisis  is unacceptable
But if growth were higher and unemployment were falling such scandals would not be treated as such a drama
Two factors are intensifying the pressure on Sarkozy
First the public is increasingly aware that urgent and straightforward policies are desperately needed in the areas of pension and healthcare payments and in state organization
Second in recent decades the French have been  more pessimistic than the rest of the world when asked about their happiness and their attitudes toward the future for themselves or for France
Not only is the market economy less popular in France than in all other European countries or the US but it is less popular than in Russia or in China
Is the future more promising
All emerging countries answer es
That is also the answer of a large majority in the US and in Europe
But in France the majority says o
This deep pessimism militates against any public debate or reform and exaggerates the importance of the current political crisis
Since the first polling companies were created in the US the UK and France in the s they have asked questions about happiness and attitudes about the future
At first the French gave the same answer as other people
But in June  the sky fell on their heads
This very centralized and proud country where the state matters more than elsewhere and the military had won so many wars witnessed the complete collapse of both in the span of just two weeks
A nonelected government that capitulated to Hitler offered a parochial vassallike future
The French never really recovered from that trauma
Despite a beautiful rebirth after the war the moral defeat of the elite and the hesitancy of the political system remain
Dire pessimism has become permanent making consensus nearly impossible to reach  an impasse made worse by the underdevelopment of civil society in France
So expect big shocks
Balancing cuts in public spending in order not to endanger growth and employment requires a stable and smart government  and time
The UK and Germany are with their excessive restrictions are preparing the ground for recessions at home
Will France address the issue with greater subtlety and avoid this risk
The grumpy moaning and intractable people of France have demonstrated many times that they can wake up and meet the challenges of the day
The Enlightenment after all was born in France
There is the French Revolution the Napoleonic epic the Battle of the Marne  won in  thanks to spontaneous initiative when the government and the state failed nd the great revival of 
France also has a higher birth rate than all other European countries and is the only one that renews each generation
Thirty years ago there was not a single French enterprise among the world top  enterprises whereas today there are 
France education and healthcare systems despite difficulties are still among the best in the world
Its intelligentsia and its scientists remain very creative and are among the best in many fields
So don bury France just yet
The French will undergo major shocks in the years to come but France might be the only European country standing tall  years from now
The Front Line of Democracy
BENGHAZI  This week I flew to Benghazi to meet Libya Transitional National Council TNC a visit coordinated with European Union High Representative Catherine Ashton and NATO allies
I was the first Western foreign minister to travel to Libya since the crisis began
What I saw reminded me of my country  years ago just after Poland first free elections which together with the fall of the Berlin Wall barely six months later came to symbolize the Cold War end
Peoples in transition from authoritarian rule  peaceful in Poland in  bloody in Libya today  grapple with decisions that determine their fate for decades
How should the former regime worst wrongdoers and security police with their insidious archives be treated
Should the former ruling party be banned
How can civilian democratic control of the army and police be secured
What role should religion play in public affairs
Should the constitution establish a presidential or parliamentary system
The former communist world made those choices  years ago
But very different choices  for better and for worse  were made in Poland Hungary and Czechoslovakia in the Baltic states across the former Soviet Union in Central Asia and in East Germany
The results form a crucial database of experience
Today Arab reformers thus can draw on our successes  and avoid our mistakes
We central Europeans knew the misery of communism
Yet we knew what we wanted to replace it with  a system based on modern European democratic market values
Building democratic structures requires time discipline pain and patience
But it pays off
In July Poland will assume the EU presidency for the first time we have earned this responsibility to lead European affairs over the next six months
Poland learned the hard way that demanding change and defying oppression are much less difficult than formulating and delivering a clear reasonable program for a better future
Not all popular demands for freedom succeed in the confusion reactionary forces can make their move
The fall of the Shah in Iran had ruinous consequences for that country
Belarus won independence in  but since  President Alexander Lukashenko has shamelessly embraced communist symbols  and methods  to cling to power
Europe has unfinished business here
Today across North Africa millions of people are demanding a voice in their own destiny
Each country is looking to change and move forward
In Morocco the King has announced constitutional reforms including guarantees for public participation in national decisionmaking an independent judiciary and new regional authorities
This measured inclusive reform can be a model for others
And reformers in the Arab world have had tremendous support from Qatar which has provided an example of strong leadership particularly in Libya but also through the news channel Al Jazeera  a real force for change in the region
Libya is experiencing a deadly struggle between people insisting on change and a desperate greedy regime determined to cling to power after  years of crass misrule
The United Nations Security Council supported by the Arab League has authorized the use of all necessary means to protect Libyans from the cruelty of their own leaders
Our NATO allies launched proportionate military operations aimed at denying Col Muammar Qaddafi regime the means to attack civilian targets
Governments worldwide have frozen illicit assets stashed abroad by the regime  money that should be used to help the opposition to build a new society
I went to Benghazi to assess the intentions and credibility of the Transitional National Council and Libyan opposition
We brought medical supplies for the Benghazi Medical Center where injured people from Misurata and elsewhere are being treated
Around the table sat improbable allies some had been prominent officials in Qaddafi regime others had spent many years in prison under sentence of death
They were united in recognizing that their country deserved a new start
I was reminded of Poland oundtable in  when Solidarity sat with the ruling communists to negotiate the end of the regime
I talked frankly with TNC Chairman Mustafa Abdul Jalil Deputy Chairman Abdul Hafez Ghoga and TNC Defense Minister Jalal Dheili himself a former political prisoner
They were grateful for the international community involvement but described in moving terms the huge loss of life that Qaddafi had inflicted on his own people
I told them that we considered the TNC to be our new legitimate political interlocutors in Libya and were ready to support them but that in return we expected the TNC to work towards the best standards of transparent democratic government
They had to realize that they need a plan  revolutionary moments are moments to be seized
Poland would help by offering training for TNC officials
Following this visit my message to European leaders is twofold
First Libya TNC is the best bet we can make now for Libya future
Its leaders are cooperating in an effort to bring about real reform in a way that was unthinkable a few months ago
They deserve the world energetic support
Second while Europe has much to offer its North African neighbors in terms of financial support advice and training the region needs to find its own path to freedom and success
Let us approach this task in the best spirit of European solidarity but also with a certain humility
Europe former communist countries can make a special contribution to the process of transition across North Africa
Above all we understand that sustained reform requires assuming responsibility by mobilizing the energy of one own people not relying on wellintentioned but often illfocused outside help
Poland is ready to lead the way on its own and as EU President
For example former President Lech Waesa recently visited Tunisia to offer advice as part of a Polish program to help Tunisia devise robust constitutional reforms and election laws
North Africa people know what they don want  and won accept
But they are struggling to identify what they do want and how to build it
As I saw in Benghazi there is a fair chance that Libya emerging leaders will be good realistic partners for good realistic policies
The Frontiers of Power
SINGAPORE  There are close to  billion people in the world without access to electricity more than half in the Asia Pacific region
Unfortunately in today world it is almost impossible to find viable incomegenerating activities without access to electricity
Renewable energy technologies RETs are invaluable to those who live outside the boundaries of power grids
The Renewable Energy Policy Network for the TwentyFirst Century REN estimates that there are tens of millions of rural households served by renewable energy around the globe
But this still translates into a mere drop in the ocean
Why doesn the power grid reach these households in the first place
For starters they are typically located in remote villages where grid access is prohibitively expensive
Governments lack both the means and motivation owing to their inability to recoup costs from poor villagers often because subsidized electricity prices depress revenues
In some cases grid expansion makes sense after removing these distortions
But where the villages and households are too remote expanding the grid will never make economic sense
These households resort to traditional fuels such as wood oil and candles for heating and lighting leading to severe indoor pollution not to mention chronic fire hazards
Study after study has shown the devastating effects that indoor pollution has on women children and publichealth finances
Moreover these fuels are not cheap costing isolated households a significant proportion of their income
Offgrid RETs represent a viable solution and come in various forms solar home systems minihydroelectric generators rooftop wind turbines and villagelevel minigrids using a mix of diesel generators and local renewable sources to name a few
A solar home system connects a photovoltaic panel to florescent lightbulbs radio and even TV via a battery and load controller
A World Bank study has shown that a watt solar home system can cut monthly kerosene consumption in rural households by roughly  liters
Many ask why the most expensive technology should be used for the poorest people
A watt panel could cost roughly   a huge sum for households earning  or less annually
However with installment financing monthly costs become not only manageable but competitive with traditional fuels
The monthly leasing cost of the watt panel in question when stretched over  years can be as little as 
And offgrid RETs offer tangible benefits better lighting a safe and smokefree home environment and the opportunity to connect to the world through TV or radio
Governments in poor and developing countries have been promoting projects to distribute offgrid RETs for decades supported by multilateral institutions bilateral aid programs or nongovernmental organizations
The private sector has typically stayed out owing to long costrecovery periods small market size and lack of consumer credit
But the nature of these projects is now changing
The oftendebilitating impact of the traditional foreignaid model on developing countries nascent private sectors has led to a fundamental reconsideration
New projects are more marketdriven with donors focus gradually shifting to building the capacity of domestic regulatory and technical institutions and to strengthening the position of existing privatesector firms to serve the market
It was precisely such a model that led to the emergence in China of the World Bank famous olden Sun standard for solar panels which focused disproportionately on strengthening technical institutions
The project is often credited for leading to the boom in manufacturing of photovoltaic panels in China which has dethroned Germany and the United States to become the world largest producer
There are many ways to undertake rural electrification using offgrid RETs
Governments can choose householdlevel technologies or villagelevel microgrids involve aid donors or use other modes of financing offer subsidies to encourage private entrepreneurs or energyservice concessions to existing utilities lease the equipment by providing consumer credit or sell it up front
The important thing is to recognize that there is a broad spectrum of available options and that efforts need to be ramped up on a massive scale
In India alone every third person lacks access to electricity
If we want to avoid isolating communities and ensure inclusive economic growth we need to start with the basics
The Fukushima Syndrome
BIRMINGHAM  The dramatic events that unfolded at Japan Fukushima Daiichi nuclearpower plant after last year tsunami are commonly referred to as he Fukushima disaster
We need look no further than this description to begin to understand the significant misconceptions that surround nuclear energy
It was the tsunami caused by the largest earthquake ever to strike Japan that killed more than  people destroyed or damaged roughly  buildings and left the country facing what its prime minister described as its biggest crisis since World War II
Yet it is Fukushima that is habitually accorded the isaster label
In fact although what happened was shocking the events in the hours and days after a giant wave slammed over the nuclear plant protective seawall might be interpreted as a remarkable testament to nuclear power sound credentials
To be sure the environmental impact on those living close to Fukushima may take many years to remediate
But the response in many quarters  not least in Germany Switzerland and other countries that immediately condemned and retreated from nuclear energy  once again typified an enduring lack of knowledge concerning two fundamental issues
The first is safety the second is radiation
We need to promote a much more inclusive and informed dialogue about both if nuclear power is to be assessed on its genuine merits rather than dismissed on the grounds of little more than ignorance and intransigence
Would the many people who would ban nuclear power also prohibit air travel
After all the parallels between the two industries are central to the question of safety
We are often told that air travel statistically speaking has a better safety record than any other form of transport
The numerous interrelated reasons for this might usefully be summarized by comparing an airplane to a bicycle
We all appreciate that an airplane is a sophisticated device and that a bicycle is not
We also acknowledge that the consequences of an airplane crash are liable to be far more catastrophic than say those of a cyclist clipping a curb on his way home from the shops
Accordingly designing and manufacturing an airplane is many times more demanding and thorough than designing and assembling a bicycle is
The same can be said of the approximately  nuclear reactors around the world
The fact is that the industry safety record is second to none when measured against those of its rivals
Like airplanes nuclear reactors are conceived and constructed to mindboggling standards
For all of the tension and fear surrounding the fight against a nuclear meltdown at Fukushima we should not forget that the plant  and with it the notion of a nuclearenergy industry  was subjected to an extraordinary test in the strictest sense of the word
Were it not for some design flaws that would not be repeated today Fukushima might well have survived intact  and history would be so different
Indeed nuclear energy is a safer proposition now than ever before but for many people the mere spectacle of an event like Fukushima  regardless of the outcome  is sufficient to draw the opposite conclusion
If a  crashed into a nuclear facility we would be unlikely to hear calls for all airplanes to be outlawed but the clamor for every reactor on the planet to be shut down immediately would probably be deafening
Remember too that Fukushima was built in the  and that the technology on which it was based dated from a decade earlier
Its successors are radically different in how they work as is the regulatory framework which sets astonishing new benchmarks for the care and quality required at every stage of the process
The case against nuclear power is deeply rooted in concerns over safety in general and radiation in particular
The Fukushima accident having reinforced too many opinions and reshaped too few makes it vital that we try to bring clarity to these issues  especially in those countries including the United Kingdom where the notion of a sustainable energy policy remains undetermined
While we know the corollaries of high levels of radiation exposure what happens at the other end of the scale is less clear
The world is full of radioactivity  walls concrete even bananas contain traces  and our bodies have adapted to it
In countries like Brazil and India people live in environments that have  times the radiation commonly found in the UK apparently with no negative genetic effects
Some experts even argue that we may need a degree of radioactivity to stimulate our immune systems
Of course there remain concerns around the vital issues of waste disposal and proliferation
Again consensual debate is required
But that requires formulating a roadmap that tells us where we stand and what we must do
We need to create the necessary culture of dialogue within industry and academia
And we need to encourage people to think and reflect more
Above all we need to enhance the public grasp of the energy sector as a whole
Currently there is too much  know and his is what I firmly believe frequently from influential people in cases where there is no incontestable right or wrong
Fukushima is one of them
It is still not too late  not quite  to start couching the broader discussion of nuclear energy in language that will inform rather than alarm and in terms that will nurture wellbalanced judgments rather than entrench longheld biases
The Full Brady
BERKELEY  Financial markets are increasingly certain that a Greek debt restructuring is coming and European policymakers fear the worst
n the worst case as Juergen Stark a member of the European Central Bank board has put it  debt restructuring of a eurozone member could put the consequences of Lehman bankruptcy in the shade
But there is also a bestcase scenario where Greek debt is restructured in a way that doesn threaten the banking system
The simplest way to achieve this would be to require banks exposed to southern European debt to raise more capital
The second round of stress tests by the European Banking Authority is ostensibly designed with this end in mind
By showing who is weak and who is strong proper stress tests would also limit counterparty risk
Lenders would have good information about whom to do business with  and whom to shun
But Europe track record does not inspire confidence that the next round of tests will be much more rigorous than the last
Raising capital is expensive
This encourages stakeholders to deny rather than acknowledge problems
Plan B would extend the maturity of Greece debt
The Greek government could simply announce that it was exchanging its bonds for new ones maturing in say  years
There would be no writedown of principal or aircut for creditors only more time for repayment
Banks would be spared having to acknowledge losses
But this would still leave Greece with an impossibly heavy debt burden
A reduction in that burden of  whether in the form of reduced interest or principal is needed to bring the debttoGDP ratio to below  a level at which the country has some hope of meeting its payment obligations
Fortunately there is another way emulate the Brady Plan under which commercial banks together with the United States the International Monetary Fund and the Paris Club of sovereign creditors restructured and took haircuts on the debt of Latin American and Eastern European governments at the end of the 
Two of my Northern California neighbors Peter Allen and Gary Evans  both veterans of the Brady Plan  have explained how a similar plan could be implemented today
First the new bonds could be structured so that haircuts incurred by the banks count as tax losses reducing the hit to their profits
This would amount to using governments fiscal resources to facilitate a Greek restructuring
But if taxpayer money is at risk anyway as it is today why not use it creatively
Second the ECB could offer to provide special treatment  ecured financing  on the new debt to make it attractive to investors
Third regulation could be used to reconcile Greece need to restructure now with the banks wish to wait until their balance sheets are stronger
Under the Brady Plan an accounting rule called FASB  allowed restructured loans to continue to be booked at their original face value so long as the sum of interest and principal payments on the restructured instrument at least equaled that on the original credit
New bonds on which interest was backloaded could be given the same accounting value as old ones on which interest was paid earlier
This special accounting treatment could then be phased out over time requiring banks to acknowledge their losses but only once they were able to do so
Fourth the new instruments could be tailored to give both banks and official lenders a stake in the country success
Under the Brady Plan a country payments were indexed to its export prices or terms of trade
The equivalent for Greece would be to index payments to its rate of GDP growth thereby automatically adjusting Greece debt burden to its payment capacity
Bonds of this sort have worked elsewhere notably in Argentina recent debt restructuring They have not been without controversy with investors complaining that the Argentine government manipulates the statistics
But Europe has an obvious solution to this problem
It called Eurostat the European Union statistical agency
So rather than worrying that they might be approaching a Lehman Brothers moment European policymakers would be better off designing a Greek debt deal tailored like the Brady Plan to avoid this fate
The twist to this story is that the head of the Paris Club at the time of the Brady Plan was none other than JeanClaude Trichet the current president of the ECB
The Paris Club under Trichet provided Poland with a  reduction of its debt on the condition that the country bank creditors take a similar haircut
What better legacy for an outgoing ECB president than to dust off his notes and explain to other European policymakers how the lessons of the Brady Plan might now be applied
A Bumpy Ride for Emerging Markets
BERKELEY  Emerging markets have been the darlings of global investors for most of the last decade
Even staid pension funds and sovereign wealth funds have increased their allocations to emergingmarket assets
Recently however the environment for capital flows to emerging economies has deteriorated sharply
Slowing growth and policy missteps together with signs that the US Federal Reserve will start tightening monetary policy by scaling back its uantitative easing QE or openended purchases of longterm assets have triggered deep selloffs in emerging economies currency bond and equity markets
What went wrong
Are we witnessing the collapse of yet another economic bubble as many analysts are claiming
Capital flows to emerging economies surged from  to  collapsed briefly during the  global financial crisis and then surged again from  to 
In  growing anxiety about a possible financial crisis in Europe interrupted these flows but they rebounded in 
By the end of that year flows of foreign direct investment FDI portfolio equity and portfolio debt to emerging economies had reached record highs
FDI flows which are less volatile than other capital flows remained by far the largest accounting for nearly  of emerging markets total inflows in 
But from  to  portfolio bond flows which are sensitive to sudden shifts in investor sentiment were the most rapidly growing component of inflows
Forthcoming research by the McKinsey Global Institute MGI estimates that emerging markets accounted for about  of all crossborder portfolio bond flows during this period  an alltime high
According to economic theory the major determinants of capital flows to emergingmarket economies are real growthrate differentials interestrate differentials and global risk aversion
Faster growth and higher interest rates in emerging markets relative to those in developed economies encourage capital flows to the former while an increase in global risk aversion  for example during the eurozone crisis in   discourages them
Research by the International Monetary Fund and a Fed working paper confirm that this theory fits the patterns of the last decade although some changes have occurred since the  financial crisis
The IMF finds that emerging markets net capital inflows have been above their longterm structural trend and more sensitive to interestrate differentials since 
The Fed study finds that emerging economies total net capital inflows have been higher than expected in the postcrisis period driven by largerthanpredicted net portfolio inflows mainly bond flows
And since the crisis portfolio flows have been more sensitive to both interestrate differentials and global risk aversion
The MGI also finds that compared to precrisis trends portfoliodebt inflows to emerging markets were larger than predicted between  and 
The recent decline in capital flows to emerging markets is also consistent with theory
For starters the growthrate differential favoring emerging markets has declined
China growth has fallen as it attempts to rein in excessive credit and bad debt
China slowdown and prolonged recession in parts of Europe have weakened demand in global commodity markets depressing growth in commodityexporting countries like Brazil Russia and South Africa
Meanwhile India growth rate has plunged as a result of faltering economic reforms and unsustainable budgetary choices it now has recordhigh fiscal and currentaccount deficits
And political unrest has marred growth prospects in Turkey Brazil and South Africa
Moreover global risk aversion has spiked in response to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke announcement of plans to aper QE
As the  and  experiences demonstrate heightened risk aversion among global investors reduces capital flows to emerging markets even when they are not the source of risk
Finally the interestrate environment has changed
Despite repeated assertions by Fed officials that they are committed to nearzero shortterm interest rates for the foreseeable future hints of QE tapering have caused yields on tenyear US Treasury bonds to rise by  basis points from this year lows
Higher longterm interest rates in the US and expectations of further hikes are eating into the interestrate differentials that attracted yieldhungry investors to emerging markets from  to 
The losses in emergingmarket currencies and assets in recent months are a harsh reminder of an inconvenient truth when the Fed tightens monetary policy to manage macroeconomic conditions in the US there are large unintended spillover effects on capital flows to emerging markets
We saw this before in the events precipitating the financial crises that engulfed emerging markets in the late 
Fortunately many emerging economies are better prepared to weather the storm now than they were then
Their exchange rates are now flexible they have built large foreigncurrency reserves and they have limited their foreigncurrency debt
Moreover their macroeconomic fundamentals are sound and they have used macro and microprudential tools to contain surges in capital inflows and minimize their destabilizing effects on asset prices and credit conditions
But some countries are at risk especially those with large currentaccount deficits large foreign capital inflows relative to the size of their financial markets and low foreignexchange reserves
Among the most vulnerable are Turkey South Africa Brazil India and Indonesia  a group that Morgan Stanley researchers have dubbed the ragile Five
At the recent annual meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole Wyoming IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde expressed concern about slowing growth in emerging markets and urged them to pursue additional economic reforms
But she acknowledged that the inevitable exit from ultraeasy monetary policies in the US and other developed economies could trigger financialmarket instability in emerging economies and pledged IMF support including on a precautionary or preemptive basis to assist them
Over the long term owing to increasing populations expanding middle classes and rapid productivity gains emergingmarket economies that pursue sound policies will continue to grow much faster than developed economies
Once the market turbulence sparked by changes in US monetary policy subsides they will once again become the darlings of global investors seeking returns from growth and diversification

The Fusion Myth
France is now rushing to construct the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ITER which is supposed to show that nuclear fusion can be used to power nuclear power stations
ITER is often presented as the longterm solution to the problem of global warming because nuclear fusion can provide an infinite and clean source of energy
But ITER will do nothing of the sort
In the fission reactions that nuclear power generation relies on today heavy elements such as uranium break into smaller ones while in nuclear fusion small elements such as hydrogen stick together and form heavier elements helium
Both fission and fusion produce a lot of energy
Some political leaders explain that nuclear fusion is at work in the sun and that thanks to ITER we will harness it
They often add that since fusion burns hydrogen which can be found in seawater it is an infinite source of energy
Unfortunately political leaders know little about the scientific issues involved
That nuclear fusion is a source of energy has been known since the invention of the hydrogen bomb
But its control is still a fundamental challenge for research institutes not some minor technical difficulty that can be easily overcome
Confining a little sun inside a box is an extremely difficult task for three main reasons
First the nuclear fuel is not seawater but a mixture of the two heavy isotopes of hydrogen deuterium and tritium a radioactive element that has been produced in small quantities for hydrogen bombs
Any development of fusion reactors would require producing tritium with industrial methods that have yet to be invented
Second the deuteriumtritium fusion reaction starts at around  million degrees
To achieve this requires using a magnet to accelerate a plasma that is a big flame of deuterium and tritium nuclei
This must be done in a ultrahigh vacuum in a large chamber
ITER is not designed to produce electricity but to study the stability of the flame in the magnet
Since the fusion reactions produce alpha particles which pollute the plasma one has to insert a ivertor inside the flame at  million degrees in order to clean it
Nobody has ever accomplished this but ITER may be able to try around   that is if it solves the previous problem
Third fusion also emits neutrons that will produce helium gas bubbles inside the wall material which tends to explode
The supporters of ITER explain that if the walls are porous the bubbles can escape
But nothing can be both leakproof and porous and ITER is not designed to study this contradiction
In the future a lanket should be inserted between the plasma and the walls with two objectives to protect the outer walls and to produce tritium from nuclear reactions within a circulating fluid containing lithium
This might work but the first wall of the blanket will need to be not only leakproof and porous but also sufficiently permeable to neutrons which have to hit the lithium atoms beyond it
The problem of materials is an entire research field in itself
In order to study it it has been decided to build the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility IFMIF in Japan
Some scientists have argued that the neutron irradiation in IFMIF won be the same as in fusion reactors but it should be noted that its cost at one billion euros will be onetenth that of ITER
So why can we wait for IFMIF results before building ITER
It all depends on one budget
If ITER could really solve the planet energy problem  billion would be a negligible investment  less than the net profit of the oil company TOTAL  billion in  and equivalent to ten days of waging the war in Iraq
But if fusion is ever to work in industrial power stations it will take many decades
Even if ITER is successful and if one solves the tritium and material problems everything would need to be tested in real size and only then could a first prototype of an industrial reactor be built
A drastic reduction of CO emissions is an urgent priority but fusion is unlikely to produce sufficient energy to achieve that goal before the twentysecond century
In fact ITER is a big instrument for fundamental research so its  million Euros annual cost needs to be compared with similar scientific initiatives such as the European Organization for Nuclear Research CERN which costs one billion Swiss francs per year
In my opinion searching for the fundamental structure of particles is far more important than studying the stability of a plasma 
In France the contribution to ITER is more than all the available funding for research projects in all our physics laboratories
So the danger is that ITER will squeeze out funding for other vital research
We already have the bad example of the International Space Station a waste of  billion that has produced no scientific results
ITER will not solve our energy problem
Although it has some scientific interest in plasma physics the participating countries should clearly state that funding it won affect the rest of their research efforts
At the same time the international community should support research on energy saving and storage and accelerate the development of fourthgeneration nuclear reactors which will use fission and be both clean and durable
Chvismo After Chvez
CARACAS  With the death of Hugo Chvez Chvismo has lost its supremacy in Venezuela
It does not matter that socalled Chvistas still control Venezuela parliament  of  provincial governments and all key state institutions including the judiciary
Nor does it matter that Chvez handpicked successor Nicols Maduro has already assumed the presidency
All of the signs point to the decline of Chvismo and to the end of Venezuela role as Latin America populist core
Between last October presidential election and the one held last month Chvismo lost almost  votes to Henrique Capriles Democratic Unity Roundtable  a shift that many including Chvistas attribute to aduro not being Chvez
This was the first presidential election in Venezuela that resulted in an almost even split among voters and the outcome itself remains hotly contested
If Venezuela continues along this path Chvismo could not only lose its majority it could collapse altogether
Maduro poor performance reflects his squandering of Chvez electoral capital
More important it has deepened doubt that he will be able to perform two crucial functions of Chvismo one related to Cuba and the other a more nationalist less nticapitalist purpose connected to unnamed yet powerful military figures
Chvez connections with Cuba were an important factor in his choice of Maduro  a Marxist tutored by Fidel and Ral Castro  as his heir
More than a decade ago Cuba saw in Chvez a way to drive Latin American populism in three main ways establish North American imperialism and the local ligarchies as common enemies lock in the support of the uneducated and deprived underclass and erode the bases of viable opposition
Curiously many of the young democracies born after the ignominy of the rightwing military regimes of the  and  define themselves according to Cuba longlasting communist dictatorship
Tempted by the idea of endless reelection and absolute authority Bolivia Evo Morales Ecuador Rafael Correa Nicaragua Daniel Ortega and Argentina Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner all indulge and support each other with the economically and ideologically powerful Venezuela playing an important synthesizing role
But Venezuela election may have changed all that
Given that Maduro cannot retain Chvez existing supporters he is clearly not a candidate for regional leadership
In fact with Chvismo losing ground Cuba will struggle to maintain its political influence in Venezuela  and thus the economic sinecures including heavily subsidized oil on which it depends
Moreover it will not be easy for Cuba to find a new leader to champion its absolutist ideology across Latin America
Fernndez is occupied with Argentina internal problems
Correa Ecuador lacks economic weight and former Brazilian President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva is probably not interested with Brazil growing economic and political clout having placed it out of Cuba reach
With little hope of restoring Venezuela regional authority Maduro will have to focus on safeguarding his tenuous leadership position at home
This means that forging a strong partnership with the military is essential
The military embodies the most extreme institutional transformation that Chvez achieved in Venezuela
Under his leadership what was once an apolitical and nondeliberative institution  as is standard in a democracy  became the engine of Chvez wentyfirstcentury socialism
Just as the Argentine working class formed Juan Pern electoral base  years ago Venezuela armed forces served as Chvez most steadfast supporters executing his authority throughout the country under the motto ountry socialism or death
As Chvez health deteriorated however so did the motto significance
But the overwhelming military presence in government ministries and institutions stateowned companies provincial governments and private businesses remains intact
The military has effectively achieved a coup dat without any struggle
Maduro seems to have the military support  at least for now
Whether or not the partnership lasts will depend on how Maduro tackles Venezuela many problems including high inflation a soaring crime rate pervasive corruption economic stagnation low productivity supply shortages capital flight insufficient investment weak institutions and a lack of respect for the rule of law
But Maduro must act fast
He will not be granted the day oneymoon period that new governments typically receive to revise their predecessors policies and presumably to correct their errors because his administration is a continuation of Chvez year presidency
Moreover Maduro has already been the head of Venezuela executive for almost  days first as Vice President then as acting president and now as the country elected leader
Given this Maduro cannot leave any issues unacknowledged or blame them on his predecessor
At the same time it will be difficult to address Venezuela problems effectively without Chvez electoral support rhetorical talent and charisma
To be sure Chvismo endures
Indeed it still represents roughly half of Venezuela electorate
But the rest of the population cannot and should not be ignored
If Maduro fails to recognize this and act accordingly he will lose the military support  and Venezuelans could lose their republic
Such an outcome would have serious consequences for Latin America
The Future of China Growth
BEIJING  The slowdown of China economy has captured the headlines in recent weeks
Whether it is a permanent or temporary adjustment the Chinese authorities have much work to do in laying the groundwork for strong economic performance in the medium and long term
Despite extraordinary growth since the start of its transition to a market economy in  China is facing serious challenges simultaneously rising inequality large and growing levels of environmental degradation stubborn external imbalances and an aging society
Fortunately China th FiveYear Plan  recognizes the need to deepen marketoriented reform change the country development model and focus on the quality of growth structural reforms and social inclusion to overcome the ruralurban divide and stem the rise in income inequality
In line with this bold longterm approach a new report China  Building a Modern Harmonious and Creative HighIncome Society proposes reforms that my country needs to develop a mature wellfunctioning market economy by 
The report is the result of a longstanding ChinaWorld Bank partnership
Commemorating the th anniversary of China membership World Bank President Robert B Zoellick proposed to the country leaders a joint effort to identify and analyze China mediumterm development challenges
China  calls for structural reforms that would redefine the role of government overhaul stateowned enterprises and banks develop the private sector promote competition and deepen liberalization of the land labor and financial markets
While providing relatively fewer tangible public goods and services directly the Chinese government will need to provide more intangible public goods and services like rules standards and policies
Such policies and institutional improvements increase productivity promote competition facilitate specialization enhance the efficiency of resource allocation protect the environment and reduce risks and uncertainties
In the enterprise sector the focus will need to be on increasing competition in all sectors reducing barriers to entry and exit for private companies and strengthening stateowned enterprises competitiveness
In the financial sector the banking system must be commercialized thereby gradually allowing interest rates to be set by market forces while capital markets must be deepened in tandem with the development of the legal and supervisory infrastructure needed to ensure financial stability
In the labor market China needs to accelerate reforms of the hukou household registration system to ensure that by  workers can move more freely in response to market signals
Currently anyone who moves to another part of the country without a hukou risks losing access to education social services and the housing market
China policymakers also need to introduce measures to increase laborforce participation rates rethink wage policy and make socialinsurance programs portable nationwide
Finally farmers rights need to be protected the efficiency of land use must be increased and policies for acquisition of rural land for urban use should be overhauled
China mediumterm success will also require creating an open system in which competitive pressures encourage Chinesecompanies to engage in product and processinnovation not only through their ownresearchanddevelopment efforts but also through participationin global RampampDnetworks
The priority is to increase the quality of RampampD rather than just its quantity
Policymakers will need to focus on increasing the technical and cognitive skills of university graduates and on building a few worldclass research universities with strong links to industry
An enlightened strategy must encourage China to row green as opposed to growing rapidly now and facing massive environmental costs later
Encouraging new investments in lowpollution energy and resourceefficient industries would lead to greener development spur investments in related upstream and downstream manufacturing and services and build an international competitive advantage in a global sunrise industry
China  also calls for expanding opportunities promoting social security and reducing the country relatively high social and economic inequality by addressing the ruralurban disparities in access to jobs finance and highquality public services
Doing so will require greater sustained attention to underserved rural areas and migrant populations and to restructuring social policies in order to ensure secure safety nets
Moreover it is vital to strengthen China fiscal positionby mobilizing additional revenues and ensuring that local governments have adequate financing to meet their rising expenditure responsibilities
Such reforms can help to ensure that budgetary resources are available at different levels of government central provincial prefectural county township and village and are commensurate with expenditure responsibilities
Last but not least China should become a proactive stakeholder in the global economy
By continuing to intensify its global trade investment and financial links which have served it well over the past three decades China would benefit from further specialization increased investment opportunities and higher returns to capital as well as mutually beneficial flows of ideas and knowledge
China must remain committed to resuscitating the stalled Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations and support a global agreement on investment flows
Global integration of China financial sector will require opening the capital account which will have to be carried out steadily and with considerable care but it will be a key step toward internationalizing the renminbi as a global reserve currency
The proposals contained in China  could provide a framework for Chinese policymakers as they seek to achieve their goal of sustainable and harmonious growth
With the global economy entering a dangerous phase China government will need to respond to new risks shocks and vulnerabilities as they arise
But in doing so it should adhere to the principle that policy responses to shortterm problems must uphold not undermine longterm reform priorities
The Future of Development Aid
WASHINGTON DC  Even skeptics admit it effective aid works
In the last  years the share of poor people in developing countries has been cut by half and the last decade has witnessed impressive development successes in countries once thought beyond help
Globally the mortality rate for children under five has declined by a third and subSaharan economies grew by up to  per year on average
With the exception of fragile and conflictaffected countries today poor countries are very different from the poor countries of the past
In the  developing countries economies accounted for only onefifth of global economic growth
Today many of them are driving the global economy
Some estimate that by  six major emergingmarket economies  China South Korea Indonesia Brazil India and Russia  will collectively account for more than half of all global growth
There are also less wellknown success stories
Consider Ethiopia which despite one of the worst global crises of our time has been the fastestgrowing nonresourcerich African country for seven consecutive years  averaging  annual GDP growth since 
And many poor countries have started to build effective institutions control expenditure and manage their budgets and provide more of the services that their citizens need
While these results are impressive much remains to be done
Paradoxically it is exactly because there have been successes that we need to rethink development aid
Developed countries are fueling a prolonged crisis and with developing countries having generated twothirds of global growth over the last five years worldwide recovery will depend on how well they continue to perform
In this truly multipolar world the traditional aid relationship of donors and recipients  which often implies teachers and students is simply obsolete
So when development professionals gather in Busan Korea at the end of November to discuss how aid can be made more effective they should keep three key principles in mind
First the more countries develop the more they are willing and able to take charge of their future  and the less desire they have to be told what is best for them
I know that firsthand
When the  tsunami hit Indonesia I was a cabinet minister responsible for planning
The challenge appeared overwhelming
In Aceh alone  people had died and  had become homeless overnight
Damages were estimated at more than  billion and the cost of reconstruction was put even higher
After unparalleled global generosity brought a massive influx of aid I chaired a reliefcoordination meeting packed with hundreds of experts representing dozens of organizations
Many had never worked in Indonesia but nonetheless believed that they knew best how the aid effort should be handled
In a tense moment I had to remind one of the speakers that nobody was in charge of our future but us the Indonesian people
We knew that without local wnership and leadership the aid effort could not succeed
Today Aceh is hailed as a reconstruction success
The outcome is by no means perfect but given the magnitude of the task at hand it is impressive
Much has been rebuilt often better than before
People are safer and have restarted their lives
The tsunami response was a positive lesson in effective aid learned by all sides
Second as the development field grows more crowded with the number of donors and partners increasing we need to ensure that our efforts are coordinated and that we harness the knowhow and fresh insights that newcomers bring to the table
Today emergingmarket countries often come with money and expertise as was evident following the Haitian earthquake when much of the early emergency response came from Brazil and Colombia
One of the bestknown and most successful examples of these socalled SouthSouth exchanges is the transplantation of Brazil Bolsa Familia program through which poor families receive cash in exchange for keeping their children in school and getting medical checkups
The program is credited with Brazil impressive poverty reduction and has been replicated in neighboring Peru as well as in India and China
A similar Mexican initiative was implemented in New York City where early results show that poverty has been reduced health outcomes have improved and school attendance has increased  outcomes that local efforts had not achieved until adopting the tested models of southern neighbors
SouthSouth and SouthNorth cooperation shows that effective aid requires more than money
Knowledge experience technical expertise and coordination are equally important
Finally transparency and accountability are critical to longterm success
Indeed a lack of transparency can turn even real progress into outright failure
For example Indonesia Suharto a benevolent dictator who favored small elites and fought poverty but allowed corruption to flourish eventually faced a population that was fed up with the lack of political reform
More recently several leaders in the Middle East and North Africa who produced strong but noninclusive growth met a similar fate
Transparency is important both to developing countries and to donors
The World Bank is now publishing more information on its programs than ever before and is sharing its development data for all to use free of charge
We also monitor our performance and share the results in a public corporate scorecard
As rich countries tighten their aid budgets and developing countries become more vulnerable to the effects of the ongoing crisis the question is not whether aid works but how it can work better
Learning from mistakes working together and making sure that countries are in charge of their own development are critical to successful aid programs
Anything less will prove the skeptics right
The Future of Economic Growth
CAMBRIDGE  Perhaps for the first time in modern history the future of the global economy lies in the hands of poor countries
The United States and Europe struggle on as wounded giants casualties of their financial excesses and political paralysis
They seem condemned by their heavy debt burdens to years of stagnation or slow growth widening inequality and possible social strife
Much of the rest of the world meanwhile is brimming with energy and hope
Policymakers in China Brazil India and Turkey worry about too much growth rather than too little
By some measures China is already the world largest economy and emergingmarket and developing countries account for more than half of the world output
The consulting firm McKinsey has christened Africa long synonymous with economic failure the land of ions on the move
As is often the case fiction best reflects the changing mood
The migr Russian novelist Gary Shteyngart comic novel Super Sad True Love Story is as good a guide as any to what might lie ahead
Set in the near future the story unfolds against the background of a US that has slid into financial ruin and singleparty dictatorship and that finds itself embroiled in yet another pointless foreign military adventure  this time in Venezuela
All the real work in corporations is done by skilled immigrants Ivy League colleges have adopted the names of their Asian counterparts in order to survive the economy is beholden to China central bank and uanpegged US dollars have replaced regular currency as the safe asset of choice
But can developing countries really carry the world economy
Much of the optimism about their economic prospects is the result of extrapolation
The decade preceding the global financial crisis was in many ways the best ever for the developing world
Growth spread far beyond a few Asian countries and for the first time since the  the vast majority of poor countries experienced what economists call convergence  a narrowing of the income gap with rich countries
This however was a unique period characterized by a lot of economic tailwind
Commodity prices were high benefiting African and Latin American countries in particular and external finance was plentiful and cheap
Moreover many African countries hit bottom and rebounded from long periods of civil war and economic decline
And of course rapid growth in the advanced countries generally fueled an increase in world trade volumes to record highs
In principle low postcrisis growth in the advanced countries need not impede poor countries economic performance
Growth ultimately depends on supplyside factors  investment in and acquisition of new technologies  and the stock of technologies that can be adopted by poor countries does not disappear when advanced countries growth is sluggish
So lagging countries growth potential is determined by their ability to close the gap with the technology frontier  not by how rapidly the frontier itself is advancing
The bad news is that we still lack an adequate understanding of when this convergence potential is realized or of the kind of policies that generate selfsustaining growth
Even unambiguously successful cases have been subject to conflicting interpretations
Some attribute the Asian economic miracle to freer markets while others believe that state intervention did the trick
And too many growth accelerations have eventually fizzled out
Optimists are confident that this time is different
They believe that the reforms of the   improved macroeconomic policy greater openness and more democracy  have set the developing world on course for sustained growth
A recent report by Citigroup for example predicts that growth will be easy for poor countries with young populations
My reading of the evidence leaves me more cautious
It is certainly cause for celebration that inflationary policies have been banished and governance has improved throughout much of the developing world
By and large these developments enhance an economy resilience to shocks and prevent economic collapse
But igniting and sustaining rapid growth requires something more productionoriented policies that stimulate ongoing structural change and foster employment in new economic activities
Growth that relies on capital inflows or commodity booms tends to be shortlived
Sustained growth requires devising incentives to encourage privatesector investment in new industries  and doing so with minimal corruption and adequate competence
If history is any guide the range of countries that can pull this off will remain narrow
So while there may be fewer economic collapses owing to better macroeconomic management high growth will likely remain episodic and exceptional
On average performance might be somewhat better than in the past but nowhere near as stellar as optimists expect
The big question for the world economy is whether advanced countries in economic distress will be able to make room for fastergrowing developing countries whose performance will largely depend on making inroads in manufacturing and service industries in which rich countries have been traditionally dominant
The employment consequences in the advanced countries would be problematic especially given an existing shortage of highpaying jobs
Considerable social conflict could become unavoidable threatening political support for economic openness
Ultimately greater convergence in the postcrisis global economy appears inevitable
But a large reversal in the fortunes of rich and poor countries seems neither economically likely nor politically feasible
The Future of Europe
CAMBRIDGE  In the first half of the last century Europe tore itself apart in two wars and destroyed its central role in world politics
In the second half of the century farsighted leaders looked beyond revenge and gradually constructed the institutions of European integration
The thought of France and Germany fighting each other again seems impossible and the development of the European Union has greatly enhanced Europe attractiveness and soft power in the world
Unfortunately that historic achievement is now being called into question
In May  financial markets lost confidence in the ability of Greece to manage its budget deficit and to repay its debt
Fears of default began to affect other countries such as Portugal and Spain among the  members of the eurozone
In response European governments the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund arranged a  billion emergency eurozone rescue program to calm the financial storms
While that intervention provided a temporary respite uncertainty persists in financial markets
Last month German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared that if the euro fails hen not only the currency failsEurope will fail and with it the idea of European unity
European unity already faces significant constraints
Fiscal integration is limited
National identities remain stronger than a common European identity despite six decades of integration and national interests while subdued in comparison to the past still matter
The enlargement of the EU to include  states with more to come means that European institutions are likely to remain sui generis and unlikely to produce a strong federal Europe or a single state
Legal integration is increasing and European Court verdicts have compelled member countries to change policies
But legislative and executivebranch integration has lagged and while Europe has created a president and a central figure for foreign relations foreign and defense policy remains only partly integrated
Over the decades Europe has alternated between excessive optimism and bouts of uropessimism such as the current period
As the journalist Marcus Walker recently put it Europe as supposed to come of age as an actor on the world stage bolstered by the Lisbon Treaty
Instead Europe is starting to look like the loser in a new geopolitical order dominated by the US and emerging powers led by China
A eminal image according to Walker was the meeting on December   that brokered the modest Copenhagen Accord  a meeting led by the US and the Chinese who invited the leaders of India Brazil and South Africa but no Europeans
And now the recent financial crisis has exposed the limits of fiscal integration in the eurozone and raised questions about the role and future of the euro
What is the future of Europe
As The Economist has noted alk of Europe relative decline seems to be everywhere just nowYou may hear glum figures about Europe future weight and with some reason
In  Europe accounted for a quarter of the world population
By  it may account for just   and almost a third of these will be more than  years old
Europe does face severe demographic problems but size of population is not highly correlated with power and predictions of Europe downfall have a long history of failing to materialize
In the  analysts spoke of Eurosclerosis and a crippling malaise but in the ensuing decades Europe showed impressive growth and institutional development
The EU approach to sharing power hammering out agreements and resolving conflict by multiple committees can be frustrating and lacks drama but it is increasingly relevant for many issues in a networked and interdependent world
As Mark Leonard Director of the European Council on Foreign Relations has put it he conventional wisdom is that Europe hour has come and gone
Its lack of vision divisions obsession with legal frameworks unwillingness to project military power and sclerotic economy are contrasted with a United States more dominant even than Romeut the problem is not Europe  it is our outdated understanding of power
The American political scientist Andrew Moravcsik makes the similar argument that European nations singly and collectively are the only states other than the US that are able to xert global influence across the full spectrum from ard to oft power
Insofar as the term retains any meaning the world is bipolar and is likely to remain so over the foreseeable future
Moravcsik argues that the pessimistic prognosis is based on a nineteenthcentury realist view in which ower is linked to the relative share of aggregate global resources and countries are engaged in constant zerosum rivalry
Moreover as he points out Europe is the world second military power with  of the world military spending compared to  for China  for Russia  for India and  for Brazil
Tens of thousands of troops from the EU member states have been deployed outside of their home countries in Sierra Leone Congo Ivory Coast Chad Lebanon and Afghanistan
In terms of economic power Europe has the world largest market and represents  of world trade compared to  for the US
Europe also dispenses half of the world foreign assistance compared to  for the US
But all this potential strength may be to no avail if Europeans do not solve the immediate problems stemming from financial markets loss of confidence in the euro
All who admire the European experiment must hope that they succeed
The Future of Facts
BUDAPEST  At a recent conference of newspaper editors in which I took part a small crowd gathered to talk about journalism and new media
When I told the group that I had begun my career as a magazine factchecker several of them grew mistyeyed as if someone had told a group of priests about his childhood as an altar boy
I brought up my past because I think that factchecking is the single best training not just for journalism but for life in general
It teaches you to think skeptically
It is easy to believe something when someone who appears knowledgeable asserts it
But if you have a responsibility for checking facts you listen more carefully
On what sources does the speaker base his facts
Is there something in it for him  a higher stock price an advertising fee or someone else gratitude
Or is he simply biased because of the people he knows the company he works for or the attitudes he picked up at home
I spent hours picking through sources  mostly dusty papers in the years before the Internet or strangers on the telephone  to clarify questions of fact Was this really the first such product
Was Mr Smith  or already 
Was his claim that revenues had grown for the last five years true merely because of acquisitions that his company had made
And so on
My life was ruled by tk  which stands for o kum or o come in the jargon of reporters
We factcheckers would joke about the lazy reporters who would hand us copy such as uan Tigar tk years old grew up in tk before studying at tk
Now tk title at Widgets Corp he Our job was to fill in the tk
But we learned an enormous amount
We learned not just thousands of facts that I have since forgotten but an attitude of skepticism coupled with reverence for the truth
That attitude contrasts with the skepticism I once heard from a Russian reporter about her early days on the job
henever we read an article about the health dangers of butter we would immediately run out and buy as much butter as we could find she told me
e knew it meant there was about to be a butter shortage
In other words Russians looked only for the agenda the motivation behind the assertion
The actual truth was irrelevant
Of course spin propaganda and censorship persist in journalism but with one big difference Almost anyone can now operate as a reporter
How can we ensure that these selfnominated reporters respect the truth
In the United States the Federal Trade Commission has announced plans to require bloggers and celebrity endorsers to disclose gifts or payments from vendors and others seeking the bloggers positive comments online
But what about other kinds of bias
As the journalistic priesthood erodes and everyone can become a citizen reporter or commentator regulating or training all wouldbe journalists is not the answer
In line with the bottomup doityourself ethos of the Internet where people book their own flights publish their own photos and sell their own secondhand goods it should be the users responsibility to do their own factchecking
This is not to say that journalists should not check their own facts or that priests should not observe the tenets of their own religion
But in the end everyone has to become a better reader  more skeptical and more curious
Why is this story getting so much attention
Does this blogger ever say anything negative or is she always talking about the great products she uses
Does she have any kind of disclosures on her blog

What company does the product reviewer work for
Governments can impose regulations but in the end we will get the kind of journalism for which we ask
If we ask for it Web sites will offer not just content but reputation systems so that contributors will have reputations as reliable sources or not
We should not outlaw anonymity which has its uses but we can ask for details about the people whose words we are reading
Someone may legitimately want to remain anonymous but we can draw our own conclusions about their reasons
That much thinking may sound like a lot of work but it is what is required of a responsible adult these days
Compared to a century ago more people spend less time laboring to ensure their physical existence
But in this increasingly confusing world we need to spend a little more time laboring to ensure our own intellectual integrity  a task that we cannot outsource to governments or even to media
Facts are holy but not all media that claim to report them ew or old can be trusted
The Future of Ideological Conflict
WARWICK  The justconcluded French presidential election seemed to suggest that the old leftright divisions are as potent as they have ever been  and certainly in their birthplace
But are they
The modern political spectrum is an artifact of the seating arrangements at the French National Assembly after the revolution of 
To the right of the Assembly president sat the supporters of King and Church while to the left sat their opponents whose only point of agreement was the need for institutional reform
The distinction capitalized on longstanding cultural associations of right and lefthandedness with respectively trust and suspicion  in this case of the status quo
In retrospect it is remarkable that this distinction managed to define partisan political allegiances for more than  years absorbing both the great reactionary and radical movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
But the decline in voter turnout in most of today democracies suggests that this way of conceptualizing ideological differences may have become obsolete
Some have even argued that ideologies and parties are irrelevant in an increasingly fragmented political landscape
But one division that looms on the horizon could reinvent the rightleft distinction for the twentyfirst century precautionary versus roactionary attitudes toward risk as principles of policymaking
In social psychological terms precautionary policymakers set their regulatory focus on the prevention of worst outcomes whereas proactionary policymakers seek the promotion of the best available opportunities
The precautionary principle is the better known of the two and increasingly figures in environmental and health legislation
It is normally understood as the Hippocratic Oath applied to the global ecology above all do no harm
By contrast the proactionary principle is associated with selfstyled futurists for whom being uman is defined by our capacity to keep ahead of the game when taking calculated risks whether by benefiting from success or learning from failure
The difference between the two principles is most clearly apparent in their implications for the relationship between science and technology
Precautionary policymakers invoke scientific uncertainty to curb technological innovation whereas their proactionary counterparts encourage innovation as an extension of scientific hypothesis testing
They also differ subtly over their conception of humans
Precautionary types aspire to a ustainable humanity which invariably means bringing fewer of us into existence with each of us making less of an impact on the planet
Those with a proactionary bent are happy to increase the planet human population indefinitely as nothing more or less than a series of experiments in living regardless of outcomes
Not surprisingly conventional political and business leaders are not entirely comfortable with either group
After all precautionary policymakers would have business value conservation over growth while the proactionary camp would have the state encourage people to transcend current norms rather than adhere to them
A precautionary firm would look like a miniature version of today regulatory state whereas a proactionary state would operate like a venture capitalist writ large
But perhaps most conspicuously absent from both precautionary and proactionary thinking is the old welfarestate ideal  that we might procreate at will in a world where our offspring are assured a secure existence
For all of their substantial disagreements both sides dismiss this prospect as a twentiethcentury fantasy that was only temporarily realized in Northern Europe for a few decades after World War II
Lurking behind this dismissal is a sense that humanity itself is undergoing a massive transformation in its selfunderstanding
However that transformation is moving at once in two diametrically opposed directions which I have called umanity 
Precautionary types would reacquaint us with our humble animal origins from which we have strayed for much too long whereas exponents of the proactionary principle would expedite our departure from our evolutionary past
At the very least they would reengineer our biology if not replace it altogether with some intellectually superior and more durable substratum
To be sure the precautionary and proactionary principles remain relatively marginal to mainstream political discourse
But they have the potential to shift the ideological axis by  degrees
The right is currently divided into traditionalists and libertarians the left into communitarians and technocrats
In the future I suggest the traditionalists and the communitarians will form the precautionary pole of the political spectrum while the libertarians and technocrats will form the proactionary pole
These will be the new right and left  or rather down and up
One group will be grounded in the earth while the other looks toward the heavens
The Future of Internet Search
NEW YORK  Imagine that Googling an address gave you a list of the closest buildings ranked by distance
Not exactly what you were looking for most likely
But that is pretty close to what we still accept for most Internet searches
You dont get what you actually want to finish your task you get a list of pages that might lead you to it
That is beginning to change
Even as the online world has turned its attention from searching to social networking search is getting interesting again
Consider the development of online search in the broadest terms
First came Yahoo with its carefully cultivated by human editors catalogue of interesting web pages
Then along came Google with cofounder Larry Page innovative ranking of Web pages not just by their content but also by the quantity and quality of other pages that link to them
Social networking brings a new insight
People are likely to buy what their friends recommend which is why marketers should spend time on social networks and join the conversation rather than interrupt it with traditional advertising
But what happens when influenced by their friends people actually go to buy something or take some action
That long list of blue links to pages that may or may not contain what they want looks pretty old
Now however something is happening to fix this and it not just a prettier background
It structure  the same sort of context the old Yahoo catalogue supplied but this time automatically generated and deeper  and across more than just a few categories such as sports and travel
For example what people want and are now getting in product search is not a list of pages but a set of products displayed in some meaningful fashion
They want a map of the product space not a list
The challenge of course is that each kind of product has a different structure and a different set of attributes
Consider wines you can sort them by price year or region of origin by red white or ros or by sparkling or still
For clothes you want sizes and colors  and perhaps some filters depending on your personal characteristics  and of course a uy now button
Some areas such as travel are even more complex
To ap travel properly the software needs to understand such things as time zones flight duration layovers and the like along with concepts such as coach or first class deluxe and standard rooms double vs single and so on
That is why there is a whole separate vertical market for travel but one that first Bing and now Google with the acquisition of ITA Software may be claiming
For a long time Google didn need to do much to remain the leader in Internet search focusing primarily on the ccess part of its selfproclaimed mission o organize the world information and make it universally accessible and useful
But runnerup Microsoft went out and bought Medstory in  and then Powerset in 
I was an investor in both of them so I have been watching these developments with interest but I have no inside information on either company since the acquisitions
Medstory has a deep understanding of health care including the relationships between diseases and treatments drugs and symptoms and side effects
Powerset a tool for creating and defining such relationships in any sphere of interest is broader but less deep
This all happened a couple of years ago  just before Yahoo gave up on search entirely and handed that part of its business over to Microsoft
Also around that time Bill Gates uttered one of the smartest things he has ever said he future of search is verbs
But he said it at a private dinner and it never spread
To me the meaning was clear when people search they arent just looking for nouns or information they are looking for action
They want to book a flight reserve a table buy a product cure a hangover take a class fix a leak resolve an argument or occasionally find a person for which Facebook is very handy
They mostly want to find something in order to do something
As a result Bing launched a few forays into vertical integration
And in the last few months Google has begun to react
First it bought ITA Software which provides the underlying data to several travelbooking sites Hotwire and Orbitz and to Kayak as well as to Bing
Most resellers a little nervous about Bing tool that sends users to book directly with airlines and hotels are even more concerned about what Google might be up to
Then last month Google acquired Metaweb and its usergenerated database Freebase
While Powerset was a tool for understanding natural language and for structuring it nder the covers where programmers could see it Metaweb lets partners and endusers create data structures or add information to structures created by others
For example MetawebFreebase has an extensive structured database of movies actors who appear in them and their directors
You can ask and get the answer to ovies directed by Roman Polanski and get only those movies  not those in which he only appeared
Try doing that with Google
You soon will be able to
Other categories include business with entities such as employers industries and employees biology space flight and many more and include representations  such as graphs timelines and tables  of how they are connected
Most things don exist in isolation
They have complex relationships to other things and by representing that information using verbs  for example he company that Google acquired vs he company that Google competes with  we can represent the world more accurately
And that means better more meaningful responses when we search
The Future of Power
CAMBRIDGE  Global government is unlikely in the twentyfirst century but various degrees of global governance already exist
The world has hundreds of treaties institutions and regimes for governing interstate behavior involving telecommunications civil aviation ocean dumping trade and even the proliferation of nuclear weapons
But such institutions are rarely selfsufficient
They still require the leadership of great powers
And it remains to be seen whether this century great powers will live up to this role
As the power of China and India increases how will their behavior change
Ironically for those who foresee a tripolar world of the US China and India at midcentury all three of these states  the world most populous  are among the most protective of their sovereignty
Some argue that our current global institutions are sufficiently open and adaptable for China to find it in its own interests to become what Robert Zoellick president of the World Bank once called a esponsible stakeholder
Others believe that China will wish to impose its own mark and create its own international institutional system as its power increases
The countries of the European Union have been more willing to experiment with limiting state sovereignty and they may push for more institutional innovation
But it is unlikely that barring a disaster like World War II the world will witness  constitutional moment such as it experienced with the creation of the United Nations system of institutions after 
Today as a universal institution the UN plays a crucial role in legitimization crisis diplomacy peacekeeping and humanitarian missions but its very size has proven to be a disadvantage for many other functions
As the  UN climatechange summit in Copenhagen demonstrated meetings of  states are often unwieldy and subject to bloc politics and tactical moves by largely extraneous players that otherwise lack the resources to solve functional problems
As US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put it recently he UN remains the single most important global institutionut we are constantly reminded of its limitationsThe UN was never intended to tackle every challenge nor should it
Indeed the main dilemma that the international community faces is how to include everyone and still be able to act
The answer is likely to lie in what Europeans have dubbed ariable geometry
There will be many multilateralisms and inilateralisms which will vary by issue with the distribution of power resources
For example on monetary affairs the Bretton Woods conference created the International Monetary Fund in  and it has since expanded to include  countries
But the dollar global preeminence was the crucial feature of monetary cooperation until the 
After the weakening of the dollar and President Richard M Nixon decision to end its convertibility into gold in  France convened leaders of five countries in the library of the Chateau de Rambouillet to discuss monetary affairs
The group soon grew to seven and later broadened in scope and membership  including Russia and a vast bureaucratic and press apparatus  to become the G
Subsequently the G began the practice of inviting five guests from the emerging economies
In the financial crisis of  this framework evolved into the G which boasts a more inclusive membership
At the same time the G continued to meet on a narrower monetary agenda new institutions such as the Financial Stability Board were created while bilateral discussions between the US and China played an increasingly important role
As one experienced diplomat put it f youe trying to negotiate an exchangerate deal with  countries or a bailout of Mexico as in the early Clinton days with  countries that not easy
If you get above  it just makes it too darn hard to get things done
He right of course
After all with three countries there are three bilateral relationships with ten there are  and with  players there are nearly 
That is why on issues like climate change the UN will continue to play a role but more intensive negotiations are likely to occur in smaller groups such as the Major Economies Forum where fewer than a dozen countries account for  of greenhouse gas emissions
Much of the work of global governance will rely on formal and informal networks
Network organizations such as the G are used for setting agendas building consensus coordinating policy exchanging knowledge and establishing norms
As AnneMarie Slaughter Director of Policy Planning in the US State Department argues he power that flows from this type of connectivity is not the power to impose outcomes
Networks are not directed and controlled as much as they are managed and orchestrated
Multiple players are integrated into a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts
In other words the network provides power to achieve preferred outcomes with other players rather than over them
To cope with the transnational challenges that characterize a global information age the international community will have to continue to develop a series of complementary networks and institutions that supplement the global framework of the UN
But if major countries are divided it is unlikely that even network organizations like the G can set the agenda for the UN and the Bretton Woods financial institutions to act upon
In the immediate aftermath of the  financial crisis the G seemed to help governments to coordinate their actions and avoid rampant protectionism
The world waits anxiously to see how it will perform when it meets again in Seoul this November
The Future of the Dollar
CAMBRIDGE  American economic policy aims for a dollar that is strong at home and competitive abroad
A strong dollar at home means a dollar that retains its purchasing power thanks to a low rate of inflation
A competitive dollar abroad means that other countries should not implement policies that artificially depress the value of their currencies in order to promote exports and deter imports
The goal of a strong dollar at home has guided the Federal Reserve at least since Paul Volcker crushed inflation in the early 
Although the United States does not have a formal inflation target financial markets understand that the Fed aims for an inflation rate close to 
And while the law mandates the Fed to ensure sustainable growth as well as low inflation monetary officials recognize that sustainable growth requires price stability
For decades US Treasury officials have insisted that  strong dollar is good for America
But that slogan has never been a guide to official US action in international markets
The Treasury does not intervene in currency markets to bolster the dollar and the Fed does not raise interest rates for that purpose
Instead the US stresses to foreign governments that an effective global trading system requires not only the removal of formal trade barriers but also the absence of policies aimed at causing currency values that promote large trade surpluses
In recent years countries around the world have accumulated very large volumes of foreign exchange topped by China with more than  trillion but including hundreds of billions of dollars held by Korea Taiwan Singapore India and the oilproducing countries
Most of these funds are now invested in dollar securities
The US dollar is and will remain these countries major investment currency reflecting the depth of the US capital market and the relatively favorable outlook for US government policies
These large foreignexchange reserves are no longer held to buffer temporary trade imbalances
While some of the funds serve that purpose and must be held in the most liquid form most of these large holdings are investment funds that will be managed to balance risk and return
That means that over time these governments will seek to diversify their portfolios moving away from the current dominance of dollar investments
The euro is now the primary alternative to the dollar
While the turmoil in Europe and the uncertain future of the euro have caused a pause in the shift from dollars to euros the rebalancing in favor of euros will resume at some point in the future
Countries with large reserves are now overweight dollars and their effort to balance risks will cause the value of the euro to rise again relative to the dollar
Several other currencies now have minor shares in those portfolios and will continue to do so in the future
The major risk to the sustained role of the dollar is the large and growing US national debt
After varying between  and  of GDP for the past halfcentury the recent budget deficits have caused the debt to reach  of GDP
The official nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicts that the policies that now seem most likely could push the debt to  of GDP by the end of the decade
Foreign investors might therefore fear that future US administrations will be tempted to reduce the real value of that debt by allowing a higher inflation rate
But that is unlikely given the Fed general antiinflationary consensus and the very short average maturity  roughly four years  of the national debt
Higher inflation would cause the interest rate on new debt to rise in a way that prevents the erosion of the real value of the total debt
But foreign investors who hold nearly half of the US government debt now  and are likely to hold an even larger share in the future  could still have reason to worry that the US might someday try to reduce the value of its debt in a way that adversely affects them but not Americans or that affects all debt holders but relieves the foreigndebt burden on American taxpayers
This need not mean outright default a plan to repay principal and interest with lowinterest securities rather than cash  or to withhold income tax on interest earned from government bonds crediting those taxes against the obligations of American taxpayers  would achieve the same result
While such policies are extremely unlikely fear of such possibilities could cause foreign investors to shun the dollar
The current policies and those proposed in the government recent budget would cause the national debt to rise rapidly but those policies are not inevitable
The best protection of the dollar future role  and of the health of the US economy  will be policies that reduce the growth of the national debt
The Future of the IMF
WASHINGTON D C The gathering pace of globalization especially of financial markets the transition of many countries from planned to market economies and the longstanding plight of impoverished peoples offer neverending challenges
What is the International Monetary Funds role in confronting them
For  years I was privileged to lead an IMF whose strengths include fostering economic cooperation and providing advice and assistance to  countries as varied as the United States and the smallest Pacific island nation
The IMF does this on the basis of a clear tried and tested mandate that is as relevant today as when the IMF was created over half a century ago
Adaptability to change has always been a hallmark of the Fund
The IMFs focus remains on macroeconomic policies that foster sustainable growth
But in response to a need demonstrated by recent financial crises the Fund now places stronger emphasis on developing sound financial systems and on good governance and transparency
Yet crisis management remains our best known activity
This encompasses both headlinegrabbing situations of imminent economic collapse as well as less visible help to countries struggling to attain external viability and growth or to countries seeking help before problems become a crisis
As a selfreforming institution the IMF reviews constantly both the kinds of advice and loans it offers to support these countries
But when it comes to crisis prevention is better than cure
So we are modernizing our loans to serve our entire membership better and to avoid crises spreading
Central to international monetary stability is the question of exchange rate regimes
A lively debate is now in progress including over the euros role once it reaches its full potential as a major reserve currency
Related to this and clearly a result of recent crises in Asia and other emerging markets is a broad effort to reform the architecture of the entire international financial system an effort that must continue despite todays rosier global economic outlook
Here the IMF retains a key role in several areas
Creating the right conditions for global financial flows is vital
Thus the Fund promotes full and orderly liberalization of capital movements including by making changes to our Articles of Agreement
To avoid disorder the Fund could be allowed to facilitate a stay of legal action by creditors in the most severe debt crises
As hard as the IMF works to sustain economic growth and financial stability systemic crises are still likely to occur
This raises the issue of the need for an international lender of last resort to provide liquidity in the event of a global credit crunch
Although the IMF is the closest that the international financial system has to such a lender in the crises of  its resources were stretched to the breaking point
What might happen in a truly systemic global crisis
The IMF like a central bank at the national level could be authorized to use its own international reserve asset the Special Drawing Right or SDR
It could inject international liquidity through the creation and allocation of SDRs and withdraw them when the crisis abated
An added systemic threat looms that posed by poverty
In cooperation with the World Bank and member governments the IMF established the Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries HIPC to provide largescale debt relief to the poorest nations
The IMF has also introduced a new form of concessional lending the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility to bring international agencies together with governments and civil society in poor countries to devise policies to stimulate growth and reduce poverty
One common element in all the issues is the need to find a global response to global problems
Ours is the first generation capable of influencing global affairs through voluntary international cooperation without employing military or imperial power
But to achieve this goal unprecedented coherence in economic decisionmaking and political responsibility is required
The risks of not grasping this opportunity are illustrated by the failure to launch the next round of trade negotiations at the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle
Industrial countries could not even take the small step of eliminating trade barriers to the exports of the poorest and most heavily indebted countries
That failure threatens to make a mockery of decisions by these same governments to write down the debt of the HIPC countries
Forgiving debt is not enough the poorest countries must be able to export grow and reduce poverty
As I leave the IMF one regret is that we have not made more progress in securing support for institutional changes needed to promote the better exercise and perception of the political accountability at the IMF
Creation of the International Monetary and Financial Committee the ministerial body that meets for the first time in April  is a step in the right direction but the world deserves better
Instead of a purely advisory committee the fullblown Council enshrined in the IMFs articles  years ago should be established
Here is a way for the IMF to secure visibly the legitimate political support of our shareholders
Another suggestion consists of replacing the G Summit every two years by a meeting of the heads of state and government of the approximately  countries that have Executive Directors on the Boards either of the IMF or World Bank
Collective decisions made under the aegis of international financial institutions must have public legitimacy
It is essential to understand the central role the IMF plays in defining the path taken so far in the search for greater prosperity and stability
The world must not lose sight of this as it strives to adapt global rules of the road and the institutions that oversee them
The Future of the JapanUS Alliance
Cambridge  Many analysts currently detect malaise in Japan about its alliance with the United States
Some of this relates to North Korea nuclear weapons and a concern that the US will not adequately represent Japan interests such as accounting for Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea years ago
Other issues concern the basing of US marines in Okinawa and sharing the costs of moving some to Guam
The list is long but they might best be thought of as ousekeeping issues many a couple can quarrel over them without contemplating divorce
There is a deeper level of concern however which relates to Japan fear of being marginalized as the US turns toward a rising China
For example some Japanese complain that China receives far more attention than Japan in the American election campaign
Such anxiety is not surprising US and Japanese defense capabilities are not symmetrical and that is bound to agitate the more dependent party
Over the years various suggestions have been made with a view to making the alliance more symmetrical including that Japan become a ormal country with a full panoply of military capabilities even nuclear weapons
But such measures would raise more problems than they would solve
Even if Japan implemented them they would still not equal the capacity of the US or eliminate the asymmetry
It is worth noting that during the Cold War America European allies had similar anxieties about dependency and abandonment despite their own military capabilities
The real guarantee of American resolve to defend Japan is the presence of US troops and bases and cooperation on issues  such as ballistic missile defense  aimed at protecting both Americans and Japanese
Moreover there are two good answers to the question of whether the US would abandon Japan in favor of China values and threat
Japan and the US unlike China are both democracies and they share many values
In addition both Japan and the US face a common challenge from China rise and have a strong interest in ensuring that it does not become a threat
The US regards a triangular JapanChinaUS relationship as the basis of stability in East Asia and wants good relations between all three of its legs
But the triangle is not equilateral because the US is allied with Japan and China need not become a threat to either country if they maintain that alliance
On the other hand China power should not be exaggerated
A recent poll indicates that onethird of Americans believe that China will oon dominate the world while  see its emergence as a hreat to world peace
To be sure measured by official exchange rates China is the world fourth largest economy and it is growing at  annually
But China income per capita is only  that of the US
If both countries economies continue to grow at their current rates China could be larger than America in  years but US per capita income will still be four times greater
Furthermore China lags far behind in military power and lacks America oft power resources such as Hollywood and worldclass universities
China internal evolution also remains uncertain
It has lifted  million people out of poverty since  but another  million live on less that  per day
Along with enormous inequality China has a migrant labor force of  million severe pollution and rampant corruption
Nor has its political evolution matched its economic progress
While more Chinese are free today than ever before in Chinese history China is far from free
The danger is that Party leaders trying to counter the erosion of communism will turn to nationalism to provide ideological glue which could lead to an unstable foreign policy  including for example conflict over Taiwan
Faced with such uncertainty a wise policy combines realism with liberalism
By reinforcing their alliance the US and Japan can hedge against uncertainty while at the same time offering China integration into global institutions as a esponsible stakeholder
The greatest danger is that an escalating fear of enmity in the three countries becomes a selffulfilling prophecy
In that sense the USJapan alliance rests on deeply rooted joint interests
There is a new dimension to the alliance however and to the relationship with China This year China surpassed the US as the world largest emitter of greenhouse gases
China argues correctly that it is still behind the US and Japan in per capita emissions but this does not reduce the costs imposed on the world including Japan and the US
A cooperative program that helps China to burn its coal more cleanly is in the interests of all three countries
In general transnational threats such as climate change or pandemics can cause damage on a scale equivalent to military conflict
In  avian flu killed more people than died in World War I
Responding to such threats requires cooperation soft power and nonmilitary instruments and this is an area in which Japan is a much more equal and important ally
If anything the new and growing dimension of transnational threats when added to traditional security concerns makes the future of the JapanUS alliance look more promising than ever
The Rise of the Robots
LONDON  What impact will automation  the socalled ise of the robots  have on wages and employment over the coming decades
Nowadays this question crops up whenever unemployment rises
In the early nineteenth century David Ricardo considered the possibility that machines would replace labor Karl Marx followed him
Around the same time the Luddites smashed the textile machinery that they saw as taking their jobs
Then the fear of machines died away
New jobs  at higher wages in easier conditions and for more people  were soon created and readily found
But that does not mean that the initial fear was wrong
On the contrary it must be right in the very long run sooner or later we will run out of jobs
For some countries this longrun prospect might be uncomfortably close
So what are people to do if machines can do all or most of their work
Recently automation in manufacturing has expanded even to areas where labor has been relatively cheap
In  Chinese companies spent  billion  billion on industrial robots
Foxconn which build iPads for Apple hopes to have their first fully automated plant in operation sometime in the next  years
Now the substitution of capital for labor is moving beyond manufacturing
The most mundane example is one you will see in every supermarket checkout staff replaced by a single employee monitoring a bank of selfservice machines
Though perhaps this is not automation proper  the supermarket has just shifted some of the work of shopping onto the customer
For those who dread the threat that automation poses to lowskilled labor a ready answer is to train people for better jobs
But technological progress is now eating up the better jobs too
A wide range of jobs that we now think of as skilled secure and irreducibly human may be the next casualties of technological change
As a recent article in the Financial Times points out in two areas notoriously immune to productivity increases education and health care technology is already reducing the demand for skilled labor
Translation data analysis legal research  a whole range of highskilled jobs may wither away
So what will the new generation of workers be trained for
Optimists airily assert that any new types of job will be created
They ask us to think of the lead drivers of multicar road trains once our electric cars join up onvoystyle big data analysts or robot mechanics
That does not sound like too many new jobs to me
Imagine a handful of technicians replacing a fleet of taxi drivers and truckers a small cadre of human mechanics maintaining a full robot workforce or a single data analyst and his software replacing a bank of quantitative researchers
What produces value in such an economy will no longer be wage labor
We can see hints of that future now
Twitter the socialmedia giant is an employment minnow
It is valued at  billion but employs just  people worldwide  about as many as a mediumsize carpet factory in Kidderminster
It is not true that automation has caused the rise of unemployment since 
What is noticeable though is that structural unemployment  the unemployment that remains even after economies have recovered  has been on an upward trend over the last  years
We are finding it increasingly difficult to keep unemployment down
Indeed the days when we in Britain thought it was normal to have an unemployment rate of  have long since passed
It was considered a great achievement of the last government that it brought unemployment down to  at the height of an unsustainable boom
And it only succeeded in doing so by subsidizing a lot of unnecessary jobs and useless training schemes
No doubt some of the claims made for robots replacing human labor will prove as farfetched now as they have in the past
But it is hard to resist the conclusion that echnological unemployment as John Maynard Keynes called it will continue to rise as more and more people become redundant
The optimist may reply that the pessimist imagination is too weak to envisage the full range of wonderful new job possibilities that automation is opening up
But perhaps the optimist imagination is too weak to imagine a different trajectory  toward a world in which people enjoy the fruits of automation as leisure rather than as additional income
During the Industrial Revolution working hours increased by  as factories replaced feasting
With our postmachine standard of living we can afford to shed some of the Puritan guilt that has for centuries kept our noses to the grindstone
Today we find a great deal of worksharing in poor countries
It is the accepted means of making a limited amount of available work go around
Economists call it isguised unemployment
If escape from poverty is the goal disguised unemployment is a bad thing
But if machines have already engineered the escape from poverty then worksharing is a sensible way of preading the work that still has to be done by human labor
If one machine can cut necessary human labor by half why make half of the workforce redundant rather than employing the same number for half the time
Why not take advantage of automation to reduce the average working week from  hours to  and then to  and then to ten with each diminishing block of labor time counting as a full time job
This would be possible if the gains from automation were not mostly seized by the rich and powerful but were distributed fairly instead
Rather than try to repel the advance of the machine which is all that the Luddites could imagine we should prepare for a future of more leisure which automation makes possible
But to do that we first need a revolution in social thinking
The Futures of Civil Aeronautics
HAMPTON VIRGINIA  Civil aeronautics is in the midst of becoming a ature industry with all the drawbacks that this entails
For decades technological advances have been essentially incremental and the industry remains largely based on longhaul transport aircraft with an emerging small jet component and a legacy of general aviation markets and products
But it has become increasingly clear that the industry cannot survive in this form
The problems bedeviling the industry include pollution from emissions increasing competition particularly from communications technology which has made business travel less necessary air traffic control delays and inefficiencies expanding noise restrictions safety and security concerns and an overall business environment highly dependent on fuel prices
Solutions for all of these problems will probably require a complete reinvention of airplane technology
The greatest hope is to be found in the ongoing information Bio Nano Energetics and Quantum technology revolutions
The IT revolution and associated warm technologies enable the foremost solution a igital airspace that is wholly automatic in terms of air traffic control navigation and vehicle operations
Automatic aircraft operation is already becoming commonplace  especially in the military  but further increases will require a similarly automatic airspace
A digital airspace would in turn enable a complete revolution in personal mobility
Together with new technologies enabling SuperShort Takeoff and Landing superSTOL a digital airspace would put safe quiet affordable streetinfrontofyourhouse personal air vehicles within sight
Socalled flying HumVee high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles would create a superb transportation system for areas lacking intercity roads and eventually would supplement  or perhaps supplant  automobiles
The variety of machines currently under study is accessible at 
 wwwroadabletimescom
 
The estimated worldwide market for such vehicles is in the range of  trillion and their use would erode the scheduled domestic airline customer base by enabling  kilometer ommutes and providing huge cost avoidance for roads and bridges
Nevertheless even given eventual development of an affordable safe flydrive airportindependent personal transportation system there would still be a need to reinvent longhaul transport especially for transoceanic flights
The current machines of this genre are direct descendants of the Boeing  and after many decades of evolutionary improvement this design approach simply lacks the scope to address the many problems that must be solved
There are several alternatives such as the blended wing body and struttruss braced wings which offer major potential increases in lifttodrag ratio and improvements in structural weight fraction
Such improvements in these parameters would provide design margins to address most of the current problems with the exception of emissions
The issue of water emissions can be addressed by designs that enable longhaul aircraft to cruise below  meters
Such designs could be enabled by using circulation control for high lift and employed at cruising altitude for ride quality
The resulting STOL short takeoff and landing performance could also improve airport productivity
On the other hand emissions of carbon dioxide can be reduced simply by using biofuels made from plants whose carbon dioxide rice was paid via uptake of the very same gas from the atmosphere during their growth
Reductions of other greenhouse gases such as nitric oxide are attainable through clever combustor design
Given the number and severity of problems currently plaguing civil aeronautics the conventional approach of evolutionary changes to current paradigms is no longer sufficient
Instead the industry must reinvent itself
With the advent of a digital airspace and with appropriate research support success would be both possible and likely
The G Empty Gestures
CAMBRIDGE  The world  most important finance ministers and  most important central bankers traveled to Washington this month from every part of the globe to accomplish predictably exactly nothing
The subject of the G recent meeting was lobal imbalances
According to the communiqu issued by the group the meeting focused on developing a procedure for identifying which G countries have ersistently large imbalances and why they have them
This delicate analytical task was assigned to the International Monetary Fund which is to complete its work before the ministers next meeting in October
It hardly takes a team of IMF economists to answer these questions
Anyone who has taken a firstyear undergraduate course in economics would have no difficulty in identifying the countries with the largest trade surpluses and deficits
The United States wins first prize with a trade deficit of more than  billion in the most recent  months
No other country comes close enough to be awarded second prize
The broader currentaccount indicator which includes trade in services and net investment income confirms America leading role its external deficit is nearly  billion
No other country has more than a  billion currentaccount deficit
Even if we look at currentaccount deficits relative to countries GDP America  ratio exceeds that of almost every other economy
The three countries with larger deficittoGDP ratios have a combined deficit of less than  billion  not enough to warrant the G attention
The country with the largest currentaccount surplus is no surprise China with a positive balance of more than  billion
Japan and Germany are the only other countries whose currentaccount surpluses exceed  billion
China currentaccount surplus is  of its GDP
Several oil producers have larger relative currentaccount surpluses that combined exceed China in absolute terms
And there are several other European and Asian countries with higher relative currentaccount surpluses that together exceed that of China
But the G decision to focus only on member countries that account for more than  of its combined GDP will exclude these smaller countries from the spotlight
Only China and the US and perhaps Germany and Japan will be at center stage
So much for the notsodifficult task of identifying the countries with big imbalances
But what about the causes of those imbalances
Every student of economics knows that a country currentaccount deficit is the difference between its national investment in business equipment structures and inventories and its national saving by households businesses and government
That is not a theory or an empirical regularity
It is an implication of the national incomeaccounting definitions
The US has an enormous currentaccount deficit because the federal government dissaving ie the fiscal deficit drags down America overall national saving
And the reverse is true for the Chinese German and Japanese currentaccount surpluses
In each of those countries the level of national saving exceeds domestic investment leaving output to be exported and funds to be loaned abroad
So the policy actions needed to reduce the trade and currentaccount imbalances are clear enough
The US must raise its national saving rate by shrinking its budget deficit which currently stands at nearly  of GDP
Fortunately the desirability of doing so is now clear to every policymaker in Washington and to most of the American public
It will begin to happen as the massive iscal stimulus enacted in  comes to an end the political process begins to deliver spending cuts and economic growth yields more tax revenue
When President Barack Obama attends the G summit of heads of state in Cannes in November he will no doubt agree to further reductions in the US budget deficit
But that will be an empty promise the US president has far less control over legislation than government heads in parliamentary democracies like Britain or in countries like China
And Obama power is even more limited now that his Democratic Party controls only one house of the US Congress
The history of previous summits suggests that the president will promise in Cannes only what he has already proposed at home
The G ministers and central bankers are of course in no position to change the behavior of either the US or China whose recently adopted fiveyear plan makes clear that it will reduce national saving by increasing consumer spending and raising government outlays for services like health care
In other words China will for its own domestic reasons reduce its currentaccount surplus
The same kind of national selfinterest that is driving the Chinese to stimulate domestic spending was at work when the G leaders met in London in April  and agreed to take steps to stimulate their economies
That agreement was easy to achieve since it was in each country interest to expand demand
The G only ratified what was going to happen anyway
But the G leaders and finance ministers nonetheless now point with pride to what they ccomplished in London
The same is likely to happen over the next few years as the US reduces its fiscal deficit and thereby shrinks its currentaccount deficit while China reduces its national saving and thereby shrinks its currentaccount surplus
The leaders of the G will no doubt claim credit for this achievement
Perhaps that is why they like to meet
The G Empty Promises
CAMBRIDGE  Talk about xit strategies will be high on the agenda when the heads of the G countries gather in Pittsburgh a few days from now
They will promise to reverse the explosive monetary and fiscal expansion of the past two years to do it neither too soon nor too late and to do it in a coordinated way
These are the right things to promise
But what will such promises mean
Consider first the goal of reversing the monetary expansion which is necessary to avoid a surge of inflation when aggregate demand begins to pick up
But it is also important not to do it too soon which might stifle today nascent and very fragile recovery
But promises by heads of government mean little given that central banks are explicitly independent of government control in every important country
The US Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke the Bank of England Mervyn King and the European Central Bank JeanClaude Trichet will each decide when and how to reverse their expansionary monetary policies
Bernanke doesn take orders from the US president and King doesn take orders from the British prime minister and it not even clear who would claim to tell Trichet what to do
So the political promises in Pittsburgh about monetary policy are really just statements of governments confidence that their countries respective monetary authorities will act in appropriate ways
That will be particularly challenging for Bernanke
Although the Federal Reserve is technically independent and not accountable to the President it is a creation of the US Congress and accountable to it
Because of the lagged effects of monetary policy and the need to manage expectations early tightening by the Fed would be appropriate
But the unemployment rate could be over   and possibly even more than   when it begins to act If so can we really expect Congress not to object
In fact Congress might tell the Fed that it should wait until there are clear signs of inflation and a much lower unemployment rate
Because Congress determines the Fed regulatory powers and approves the appointments of its seven governors Bernanke will have to listen to it carefully  heightening the risk of delayed tightening and rising inflation
Reversing the upsurge in fiscal deficits is also critical to the global economy health
While the fiscal stimulus packages enacted in the past two years have been helpful in achieving the current rise in economic activity the path of future deficits can do substantial damage to longrun growth
In the US the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that President Barack Obama proposed policies would cause the federal government fiscal deficit to exceed  of GDP in  even after a decade of continuous economic growth
And the deficits run up during the intervening decade would cause the national debt to double rising to more than  of GDP
Such large fiscal deficits would mean that the government must borrow funds that would otherwise be available for private businesses to finance investment in productivityenhancing plant and equipment
Without that investment economic growth will be slower and the standard of living lower than it would otherwise be
Moreover the deficits would mean higher interest rates and continued international imbalances
In contrast to monetary policy the US president does have a powerful and direct impact on future fiscal deficits
If the presidential promise to reduce the fiscal deficit was really a commitment to cut spending and raise taxes we could see today dangerous deficit trajectory be reversed
Unfortunately Obama shows no real interest in reducing deficits
The centerpiece of his domestic agenda is a healthcare plan that will cost more than a trillion dollars over the next decade and that he proposes to finance by reducing waste in the existing government health programs Medicare and Medicaid without reducing the quantity and quality of services
A second major policy thrust is a capandtrade system to reduce carbon emissions
But instead of raising revenue by auctioning the emission permits Obama has agreed to distribute them without charge to favored industries in order to attract enough congressional votes
Add to this the pledge not to raise taxes on anyone earning less than  and you have a recipe for large fiscal deficits as long as this president can serve
I hope that the other G leaders do a better job of reining in their budgets
Finally there is the G promise to reduce monetary and fiscal excesses in an internationally coordinated way
While the meaning of oordinated has not been spelled out it presumably implies that the national exit strategies should not lead to significant changes in exchange rates that would upset existing patterns of trade
In fact however exchange rates will change  and need to change in order to shrink the existing trade imbalances
The dollar in particular is likely to continue falling on a tradeweighted basis if investors around the world continue to set aside the extreme riskaversion that caused the dollar rise after 
Once the Chinese are confident about their domestic growth rate they can allow the real value of the renminbi to rise
Other exchange rates will respond to these shifts
In short it would be wrong for investors or ordinary citizens around the world to have too much faith in G promises to rein in monetary and fiscal policies much less to do so in a coordinated way
The G Helpful Silence on Capital Controls
NEW YORK  When French President Nicolas Sarkozy took the reins as host of this year G summit to be held in Cannes on November  he called on the International Monetary Fund to develop an enforceable ode of conduct for the use of capital controls or capitalaccount regulations as we prefer to call them in the world economy
The IMF followed through by publishing a preliminary set of guidelines this past April
Regulation of crossborder capital flows has been strangely absent from the G agenda which is aimed at strengthening financial regulation
But they are a central element in the financial volatility that incited calls for stronger regulation in the first place
The IMF has shown that those countries that deployed capitalaccount regulations were among the least hardhit during the worst of the global financial crisis
Since  it has accepted and even recommended that such regulations are useful to manage the massive inflows of ot money into emerging markets
That said while the IMF proposed code is a step in the right direction it is misguided
So the G endorsement of the Fund guidelines would not be wise for a world economy trying to recover from one financial crisis while preventing the next one
With low interest rates and a slow recovery in the developed countries accompanied by high interest rates and rapid growth in emerging markets the world investors flocked from the former to the latter  Brazil Chile South Korea Taiwan and others
Then in recent months they flocked out of those emerging countries showing once again how volatile and dangerous such flows are
Indeed as the IMF has pointed out in its World Economic Outlook these flows threaten to inflate asset bubbles make it harder for countries to pursue an independent monetary policy and trigger currency appreciation and associated losses in export competitiveness
Brazil currency for instance appreciated more than  from  until August  before weakening in recent months
Some countries responded by doing nothing but many including industrialized countries like Japan and Switzerland intervened heavily in currency markets
Some resorted to capitalaccount regulations on inflows such as taxes on the foreign purchases of bonds equities and derivatives reserve requirements on shortterm inflows and so forth
Brazil finance minister referred to these numerous actions as the urrency wars
This is where Sarkozy came in using his platform as G host to try to forge a set of enforceable guidelines to govern capitalflow management
The IMF proposed guidelines recommend that countries deploy capitalaccount regulations only as a last resort  that is after such measures as building up reserves letting currencies appreciate and cutting budget deficits
In response to these suggestions an independent Task Force made up of former government officials and academics was established to examine the use of capitalaccount regulations and come up with an alternative set of guidelines for the use of such regulations in developing countries
Among other findings and recommendations our task force pointed out that in the cases where the IMF found capitalaccount regulations to be effective such measures were part of a broader macroeconomic toolkit and were deployed early on alongside other measures not as a ast resort
Unless countries have signed trade and investment treaties that restrict the use of such regulations and many have the IMF Articles of Agreement give them full policy scope to manage capital flows as they see fit
Consigning such measures to ast resort status would reduce the available options precisely when countries need as many tools as possible to prevent and mitigate crises
Rather than embracing a globally enforceable code of conduct that could paradoxically lead to a compulsory opening of capital accounts across the globe the IMF the G the Financial Stability Board and other bodies should try to reduce the stigma attached to capitalaccount regulations and protect countries ability to deploy them
Indeed the IMF could help countries to prevent evasion of the regulations and together with the G and the FSB should lead a global dialogue about the extent to which countries should coordinate such regulations
Countries interests are considerably aligned in favor of such coordination
Industrialized economies are seeking to recover from the crisis and want credit and capital to stay home to boost growth while developing countries have little interest in gaining shortterm capital inflows
This could form the basis for industrialized countries to adjust their tax codes and deploy other types of regulation to keep capital at home while emerging markets implement measures aimed at changing the composition and reducing the level of potentially destabilizing inflows
The G New Thinking For the Global Economy
NEW YORK  The Seoul G summit was notable for the increasing political weight of the emerging economies
Not only was it located in one but in many ways it was also dominated by them
In two crucial areas macroeconomics and global economic development the emerging economies view prevailed
And an excellent proposal to link the two agendas  macroeconomics and development  emerged from the summit and should be implemented in 
A key feature of the world economy today is that it is running at two speeds
The United States and much of Europe remain mired in the aftermath of the financial crisis that erupted in the fall of  with high unemployment slow economic growth and continuing banksector problems
Emerging markets however have generally surmounted the crisis
Whereas  was a tough year for the entire global economy emerging markets bounced back strongly in  while rich countries did not
Recent data from the International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook tell the story
During  highincome countries are expected to achieve modest annual GDP growth of around  while the G emerging economies together with the rest of the developing world are expected to grow at a robust  rate
Asia developing economies are soaring with  growth
Latin America is expected to grow at 
Even subSaharan Africa the traditional laggard is expected to grow at  in 
This twospeed global economy largely reflects the fact that the  financial crisis began with overborrowing by the rich countries themselves
Two highincome economies got themselves into trouble
The US where consumers  assisted by reckless lending to noncreditworthy households  had borrowed heavily to buy houses and cars was the main culprit
The periphery of the European Union  Ireland Portugal Spain and Greece  also began a borrowing binge a decade ago upon joining the euro fueling a realestate boom that likewise went bust
Emerging economies for the most part avoided this disastrous overborrowing One reason certainly was the vivid memory in Asia of the  financial crisis which underscored the need for limits on bank borrowing and capital inflows
By and large Asian emerging economies were more prudently managed during the past decade
The same can be said about Brazil which learned from its own crisis in  as well as Africa and other regions
In the runup to the Seoul summit the US government put forward a proposal that the surplus regions of the world should increase their domestic demand  mainly consumption  to boost imports and thereby help the deficit regions including the US to recover
The G emerging economies were not impressed
Their answer was straightforward the crisis began with US overborrowing so it is America responsibility not theirs to clean up the mess
The US should cut its budget deficit increase its saving rate and generally get its own house in order
The emerging economies reacted similarly to a second US initiative the Federal Reserve socalled uantitative easing
Emerging economies once again spoke nearly in unison
They told the US not to boost the money supply artificially as this would create the risk of yet another financial bubble this time in the emerging economies and in commodity markets
Once again the clear message to the US was to stop using gimmicks like fiscal stimulus or printing money and instead undertake a serious longerterm economic restructuring to boost saving investment and net exports
For their part emerging economies wanted to change the subject from shortterm macroeconomic stimulus and imbalances to longerterm development issues
The host government South Korea was especially dynamic here
South Korea called on the G members to focus on challenges such as meeting the United Nations Millennium Development Goals raising agricultural production and building sustainable infrastructure in developing economies
This was the first time that longterm development issues had been put so clearly on the G agenda and it is a sign of the growing geopolitical weight of the group emergingmarket members
The result of the deliberations is a new framework for the G engagement with the rest of the developing countries known as the Seoul Development Consensus for Shared Growth
The G rightly decided to focus on those areas of the global development agenda where the major economies have a comparative advantage financing of infrastructure such as roads and power business development and support for agricultural upgrading in the poorer countries
Other parts of the development agenda  for example health and education  will not be the G focus
The new G development agenda offers an excellent way to merge concerns about global imbalances with the need to accelerate the pace of development in the poorer countries
The US has been pushing China Germany Japan and others to raise consumption in order to boost demand
But there is a better way to put these surplus countries high saving rates to use
Rather than pushing their households to consume more the G should work harder to channel these savings to the poorest countries in order to finance urgently needed investments in infrastructure
India Prime Minister Manmohan Singh put the matter perfectly
He noted that subSaharan Africa is now in a position to absorb more capital inflows to build infrastructure
He recommended that G surpluses be recycled to those countries and to other poor countries to finance such investments
n other words said Singh e should leverage imbalances of one kind to redress imbalances of the other kind
By channeling the savings of China Germany Japan and other surplus countries into infrastructure investments in the poor countries the world economies truly would be working in harmony
The G Seoul Summit may well have initiated that important process
The G Next Test
BRUSSELS  The G meetings this month first in Busan South Korea for finance ministers and later this month in Toronto for heads of government mark the moment when the major players in the world economy shift gear from budgetary stimulus to retrenchment
Not everyone is in agreement about this
Before the Busan meeting United States Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner warned against  generalized undifferentiated move to pull forward consolidation plans and emphasized the need to roceed in step with the strengthening of the privatesector recovery
But the other finance ministers did not echo Geithner warnings
Instead they emphasized the mportance of sustainable public finances and the need for easures to deliver fiscal sustainability
Gone is the stress on cautious gradually phasedin exit strategies the search for a rebalancing was almost unnoticeable in the meeting communiqu
This change affects Europe first and foremost
Shortly before the Busan meeting the countries of southern Europe announced major consolidation efforts in the hope of soothing debt markets
Soon after this British Prime Minister David Cameron announced ears of pain ahead German Chancellor Angela Merkel outlined a bn retrenchment plan and French Prime Minister Franois Fillon a similar bn plan 
The advanced countries face a dismal budgetary situation with deficits averaging  of GDP in  and the prospect of publicdebt ratios rising from roughly  of GDP prior to the crisis to more than  of GDP in 
According to IMF calculations to reach a  debt ratio in  would require a budgetary adjustment of almost nine percentage points of GDP on average between  and 
While some countries in the past undertook adjustments of similar magnitude a generalized consolidation of this sort is without precedent
How painful will the adjustment be
In the past some countries have enjoyed tearless consolidation because the launch of a retrenchment program was accompanied by a drop in longterm interest rates a decline in private savings or a surge in exports thanks to exchangerate depreciation or all of these at the same time
But conditions today are characterized by low interest rates and high private debt so none of these are likely to help except possibly for exchangerate effects
Indeed depreciation has already started for Europe and many observers consider the euro fall from  dollars in late  to  dollars in recent days sufficient to offset in the short term the retrenchment negative impact on growth
But this can work only as long as the US does not follow suit and continues to serve as consumer of last resort
This may not happen
Even if the US further postpones retrenchment the US Congress is unlikely to tolerate an appreciation of the US dollar that makes European exporters more competitive and shifts the burden of sustaining the recovery onto US consumers
More importantly increasingly nervous bond markets will at some point start questioning the sustainability of US public finances
The US fiscal position is no better than that of major European countries like Germany France or the United Kingdom in fact it is worse
It is only because the EU is fragmented so markets started off by questioning the solvency of the weakest countries within it and because Europe does not benefit from a safehaven effect that it was the first to suffer the pressure
Fortunately the publicfinance situation is entirely different in the developing world which in some cases has been hit by capitalflow reversals stemming from the collapse of world trade but does not face an internal adjustment challenge
While domestic credit booms may be a threat in the future emergingmarket banks have mostly remained immune from the fallout of the financial crisis
As a result domestic nonfinancial sectors do not face the prospect of deleveraging
More importantly the fiscal challenge for these economies is of much lower magnitude than in the advanced world in fact it barely exists
The starting points are a  public debttoGDP ratio and an average budget deficit that as a share of GDP is four percentage points lower than in the advanced world
Against the background of much faster potential growth only a minor effort is needed to keep the debt ratio around the  level
So what if Europe and the US both enter a phase of prolonged budgetary adjustment while the emerging world stays on course
What if the divergence between the North and South within the G widens further
Four consequences are likely
First there will be a significant drag on world growth
Whatever the emerging world does to sustain domestic demand and reorient exports from advanced countries to other emerging countries the European and US elephants not to mention Japan are just too big for their illness to have no effect on world growth
Second the growth differential between emerging and advanced countries will widen which will in turn intensify flows of capital and skilled labor towards the developing world
Third the advanced countries will need monetary support which implies low policy rates for years to come while the monetary needs in the emerging and developing countries will be radically different
This will inevitably make fixed exchangerate links crack under pressure as the same monetary policy cannot possibly be appropriate for both regions
Finally instead of managing common challenges as in  the G members will need to manage their divergence
This will be a major test of resilience for an institution that demonstrated effectiveness in the crisis but still has to pass the test posed by this new phase in the global economy
The Toronto summit will provide a first opportunity to assess the G ability to adapt to new conditions
The G Broken Aid Promises
The Millennium Development Goals are the world agreed goals to cut poverty hunger and disease
Established in  their targets were to be met by 
We are now at the halfway point
So far despite endless words about increasing aid to poor countries the rich G countries are reneging on their part of the bargain
Cynicism abounds here
At the G Gleneagles Summit in  member countries pledged to double aid to Africa by 
Soon after the summit I was invited to a small highlevel meeting to discuss the summit followup
I asked for a spreadsheet showing the yearbyyear planned increases and the allocation of those planned increases across donor and recipient countries
The response I received was chilling
here will be no spreadsheets
The US has insisted on no spreadsheets
The point was clear
Though the G had made a clear promise there was no plan on how to fulfill it indeed there were clear instructions that there would be no such plan
The G is now reaping the consequences of its inaction
For the first year after the Gleneagles meeting aid numbers were padded by misleading accounting on debt cancellation operations
With those debt cancellation operations largely completed the data are now revealing the stark truth development aid to Africa and to poor countries more generally is stagnant contrary to all the promises that were made
Specifically between  and  overall aid to Africa excluding debt cancellation operations increased by a meager 
In fact total official development assistance to all recipient countries net of debt cancellation actually declined by  between  and 
Even the World Bank which usually takes the donors point of view recently acknowledged that except for debt cancellation romises of scaled up aid have not been delivered
Private reactions among senior government officials in the G are surprising
One senior G official told me that the aid promises are all lies anyway
I don agree with that but the cynicism that such a view reflects is alarming
It shows the nature of discussions at the highest reaches of the G
All this would seem to be insurmountable if the basic economics were not clear
We are not talking about unachievable financial goals
Indeed the sum of money is minuscule
The G representing nearly one billion people has promised to increase aid to Africa from  billion in  to  billion in   a difference that represents less than onetenth of one  of the income of the rich donor world
To put it in perspective the Christmas bonuses paid this year on Wall Street  just the bonuses  amounted to  billion
Spending on the Iraq war which achieves nothing but violence is more than  billion per year
So the G commitment could be honored if rich countries cared to honor it
To salvage its credibility the G needs to make crystal clear  once again  that it will honor its commitment to increase aid to Africa by  billion per year by 
That way cynics within the G governments can understand their assignments
Moreover unlike in  the G needs to present a plan of action
The lack of specific commitments by specific countries is a shocking display of governance at its poorest
Finally recipient countries need to be informed about the yeartoyear increases in aid that they can expect so that they can plan ahead
The increased aid should be directed at building roads power grids schools and clinics and at training teachers doctors and community health workers
All of that investment requires plans and years of implementation
Aid cannot be a guessing game
It must be committed in clear terms over a period of several years so that recipients can use it in a sensible and accountable manner
Admittedly part of the problem with the G is not simply lack of good faith or political will but basic competence
The US government doesn really know what it is doing in Africa because over the years America aid agency has been largely emptied of its leading thinkers and strategists
Moreover the Bush administration politicized the delivery of aid by channeling it through private religious groups that are part of the administration political coalition
That the reason that much of the US funding on AIDS follows religious strictures rather than science
Fortunately what needs to be done is not complicated
African countries have already identified their highpriority investments in health education agriculture and infrastructure including roads power and internet connectivity
These investments could be increased systematically during the period from now until  in order to enable these countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals
The plans are already on the table or at least on the shelf waiting for the G funding to arrive
It time for the rich countries to stop giving lectures to the poor and instead to follow through on their own words
And G citizens must hold their governments accountable for what they have pledged but not delivered
The Gambler of North Korea
SEOUL  After a painstaking investigation South Korea is pointing the finger of blame at North Korea for the sinking of its warship the Cheonan on March 
The debate about how to respond is complicated by the fact that the Cheonan sinking does not seem to be a standalone event but was instead part of a change in North Korea general pattern of behavior
Indeed North Korea has become increasingly bold and impetuous ever since Kim became ill probably from a stroke in August 
In the past top North Korean leaders tended to calculate carefully the costs and benefits when they acted to put pressure on the outside world
And they were inclined to play only one of their hreat cards at a time
But in April and May  they threw diplomatic caution to the wind launching a longrange rocket as well as various missiles and conducting a second nuclear test  all in the space of several weeks
As soon as the international community reacted by adopting United Nations Security Council Resolution  North Korea quickly shifted to a charm offensive aimed at the United States and South Korea
The authorities released two American journalists and a South Korean worker whom they had seized in August  on charges of violating North Korean law
But when the North Korean regime realized that smile diplomacy did not get it whatever it was they wanted the country rulers shifted back to hostility
This time the authorities froze South Korean real estate in the Geumgang Mountain tourist zone and most seriously of all attacked the Cheonan
The regime even dispatched two spies to Seoul to assassinate Hwang Jangyop the highestlevel North Korean official ever to defect to South Korea
I believe that this change in North Korea pattern of behavior is profoundly related to recent fundamental changes there
First Kim Jongil and his third son Kim Jongun may have become much more confident as a result of North Korea emergence as a de facto nuclear state
They seem to believe that possession of nuclear weapons provides them with far wider room for strategic and tactical boldness
After all they achieved what they wanted in defiance of enormous international pressure and even succeeded in transferring nuclear technology to Syria several years ago without being punished
Given such a run of successful gambles why be timid
The second change concerns Kim successor
North Korea new boldness may reflect Kim Jongil wish to polish the yearold Kim Jongun image as a strong and decisive leader
Or it may be that all of the provocations that have followed Kim Jongil illness may be the work of Kim Jongun himself
In other words the process of power transfer may be progressing much faster than anyone outside of North Korea has guessed
Finally longterm mismanagement and international sanctions have pushed the North Korean economy to the brink of collapse
As a result the regime may be trying to divert people attention from internal difficulties and push them to unite behind the emerging new leader
The attack on the Cheonan may have been particularly useful in cementing the regime hold on the military which felt disgraced by North Korea inept performance in a confrontation with the South Korean navy near the Northern Limit Line in the West Sea in November 
But compared to the more fundamental factors discussed above I believe that this is probably a secondary motive for the attack on the Cheonan
The problem is that all three factors  nucleararmed boldness the succession and economic malaise  will continue to influence North Korea behavior for the time being
Without a strong and internationally coordinated response to the sinking of the Cheonan such reckless provocations are not only likely to continue but may become more frequent
Thus South Korea and the international community must respond firmly
A joint South KoreaUS military exercise near the Demilitarized Zone or a joint antisubmarine exercise at the Northern Limit Line should be considered
A UN Security Council resolution denouncing North Korea brutal attack on the Cheonan must be an essential part of any international diplomatic response
Making North Korea pay a high economic cost for its rash behavior should be considered as well
All of these options are however shortterm responses and will likely be insufficient to bringing about any serious change in North Korea
A more fundamental longterm strategy is needed to face the new reality and achieve lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula
One of the messages that Chinese President Hu Jintao delivered to Kim Jongil at their bilateral summit on May   concerning North Korea need to launch serious economic reform and open up to the world  has provided a clue as to how to move forward
So far the international community has focused mainly on the immediate concern of denuclearizing North Korea
But this is merely addresses the symptom not the disease
It is past time for the international community  particularly China Russia the US Japan and South Korea  to devote similar diplomatic effort to persuading and pressuring North Korea to reform and open its economy
The world must develop a more carefully calibrated policy toward North Korea one aimed at simultaneously implementing denuclearization and economic reform
The added benefit of such an approach is that it is far more likely to gain Chinese support than today singleminded focus on denuclearization
The Gangs of Central America
Central America presidents recently met in Tegucigalpa Honduras to devise a united policy to deal with the region rampaging street gangs
Honduran President Ricardo Maduro himself elected on a campaign slogan of Zero Tolerance summed up their collective wisdom he gangs have internationalized and we are going to respond with force with a strong hand
The problem of juvenile gangs in Central America is not new
In El Salvador the gangs became an issue at the end of the  in Guatemala and Honduras the gangs appeared in the first half of the 
Since then their membership has multiplied
Most explanations of the gangs growth focus on two causes the prolonged civil wars that savaged Central America during the  and America deportation policies
These theories however fail to reflect local realities
Honduras the country with the most serious gang problem never had a civil war
Nicaragua and Mexico which receive many deportees from the United States have never had the number of gang members seen in El Salvador and Guatemala
There is no denying that the region civil wars and American deportations aggravate the gang crisis but the fundamental reasons young men and women join gangs can be found in domestic social conditions
Gang members emerge out of dysfunctional and violent families the historic and systematic socioeconomic marginalization of the region poor and a culture of aggression
Gangs flourish because weak institutions fail to guarantee and respect the fundamental rights of children and young people
True such conditions exist throughout Latin America but elsewhere they do not have the same potency
Not even in Nicaragua which shares many of the characteristics of the other countries of the region have gangs become dedicated to killing and terrorizing the population in the way that they do in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador and now in Chiapas Mexico
Part of the problem lies in how Central American governments confront the phenomena
For many years officials simply ignored the emerging gang problem
They were more interested in the process of political transition and putting in place the Washington Consensus
As a result they disregarded social problems and devoted their energies to reforming their political and economic systems
Far from strengthening social institutions this lack of attention weakened them
Sheltered by indifference the gangs grew
Officials saw increased crime as the natural cost of war and many predicted that as young members matured the gangs would disappear
This hasn happened and officials now acknowledge that they have a huge problem on their hands
But it wasn increasing homicide rates that made officials pay attention it was the realization that the violence hurt the region image abroad and made it difficult to attract foreign investment
The response of the countries involved has been fragmented and repressive
Plans with names like trong Hand in El Salvador he Broom in Guatemala and lue Liberty in Honduras have been created to deal with the problem but all ignore prevention overlook the social roots of the phenomena and concentrate on applying force
Instead of articulating policies to return fundamental rights to the region young people Central American governments are preparing to wage war against gangs in the name of national security
Such policies yield substantial political benefits they help to win elections and attract the admiration and favor of the Bush administration
Officials from America FBI and Department of Homeland Security have visited Central America to share experiences in combating gangs
Still this war on gangs like the socalled war on drugs is only making matters worse
The gangs are now more organized in El Salvador because the authorities confine many of them in separate jails according to their specific group
This gives each gang an opportunity to recruit new members among prison inmates elect national leaders and establish lines of authority and decisionmaking that are respected by all
In Honduras the gangs are more connected with organized crime because the policy of cleaning the streets has pushed many gang members to align with drug traffickers for protection
And now the gangs appear to be invading southern Mexico because Central America repressive policies have sent many gang members running north
Internationalizing the trong hand model across the region will incite the gangs to spread to Nicaragua and Costa Rica which have so far been successful in preventing gang violence
If we continue to ignore the social conditions that create gangs their numbers will grow
But the outlook for a new sensible policy is not promising
At the end of the summit of Central American presidents El Salvador President Antonio Saca talked about a regional prevention plan
Unfortunately no one paid much attention to his idea
The Gaza Prison
GAZA CITY  It is easier to enter a maximumsecurity prison than it is to enter the strip of land   kilometers long and maybe eight wide  that is home to Gaza  million Palestinians
Surrounded by a forbidding wall watchtowers and deadly buffer zones I entered with a hardtoobtain visa at the Erez crossing  iron gates an interrogation by bored young immigration officers and scanners
On the other side is a kilometerlong caged walkway that leads into this part of Palestine trapped between Israel Egypt the Mediterranean and the general indifference of the international community
The view walking  in sweltering heat  through that long cage is apocalyptic
Small groups of Palestinians smash up the remains of Gaza bombed industrial infrastructure  the concrete blocks that litter the sandy landscape
They pummel the blocks for gravel and the steel bars inside
The result of their labor is hauled away in carts pulled by mangy horses or donkeys
This is much of what passes for industry in Gaza
The world periodically wakes up to the horrors of life in Gaza and then goes back to watching the World Cup or planning summer holidays
We were awakened for example by the military assault of December  and January  when more than  Palestinians including over  children and  Israelis died
We noticed the longrunning horror story again when the Israeli Defense Forces attacked a Turkish flotilla carrying relief supplies in May with nine civilian fatalities
You have to be careful with language when discussing Israeli actions
Those who argue that there is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza should not compare the situation with Ethiopia or Sudan in the middle of a drought or a war
Conditions in Gaza are harsh and the population does suffer
Israel government has denied that people are starving and has relaxed its import restriction regime
But the siege was never intended to starve Gazans as Dov Weissglass a former aid to Ariel Sharon famously observed the aim was o put the Palestinians on a diet
The intention was collective punishment imposed partly in response to Hamas political control of Gaza
Hamas won the  elections in the whole of occupied Palestine and formed a national unity government with Fatah
America Israel and much of the international community then torpedoed that arrangement
It was all very well having elections  until the wrong side won
With the changes in the import controls on Gaza  there is now a list of what cannot be taken in rather than of what can  more goods should arrive
But the ability to buy the jams muesli balsamic vinegar and pots of lemon curd that I saw in an upmarket Gazan supermarket will not do much for ordinary people  of whom depend on emergency food rations
Moreover ordinary Gazans cannot rebuild their homes and schools because building materials remain proscribed or are dribbled in only for UN projects
No raw materials which would allow the revival of Gaza commerce and industry are permitted
This is a central part of Israel policy in flat defiance of international law and customary norms of civilized behavior
With chocolate and cardamom now allowed into Gaza Israel is applying a marter siege which will keep Palestinians here isolated poor and aiddependent but not starving
When I was in Gaza before the Second Intifada there were many examples of entrepreneurial activity  factories and farms
Most of that has been stamped out
As the assault on Gaza ended in  Israeli military bulldozers flattened factories
The imposition of a border zone has gobbled up  of the strip agricultural land
But Israel and Egypt  partners in the siege  turn a blind eye most of the time to tunnels perhaps as many as a thousand that snake under the Egyptian border at Rafah and bring in blackmarket goods which Hamas then taxes
Decent wouldbe Palestinian businessmen the potential backbone of a middle class are destroyed
Racketeers flourish
Kafkaesque politics produces lice in Wonderland economics
You see some of the humanitarian problems stemming from the siege most clearly when visiting hospitals as I did with the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians of which I am President
Lifesaving drugs are in short supply and equipment often does not work because of power cuts or the absence of spare parts
Seriously ill patients require permission to be treated in West Bank hospitals and some are reportedly pressed to collaborate with Israel security services in return for being allowed out
Doctors and students can leave Gaza only rarely to attend conferences or universities abroad
I strongly opposed the international call a year ago to boycott Israel universities
But the Gaza blockade means that Israel boycotts Palestinian academic life
It is time that Israel took its boot off Gaza windpipe
Some in Israel such as Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman seem to want to cut off Gaza completely from the West Bank in contravention of the Oslo accords and the prospect of a twostate solution and push it in the direction of Egypt
But Gaza remains an integral part of Palestine  and a growing part
With its population increasing at  a year the number of Gazans will double in about  years the same timeframe in which the World Health Organization estimates that Gaza will run out of water for its population
What type of world will the children you see in such prodigious numbers in Gaza inherit Will collective punishment make them moderate lawabiding helots
History is not on the side of this immorality
I want to see Israel a free democratic society live up to its original values and be at peace with its neighbors
It will not achieve this through its appalling Gaza policy
The world  starting with the US administration and the European Union  should tell that to Israel
But don hold your breath
The Gazpromization of European Energy Security
The term nergy security in Europe has been hijacked to empower suppliers and weaken importers implying a drastic reduction in competition rising political vulnerability and the erosion of the rule of law
The fact that Russian President Vladimir Putin likely successor Dmitry Medvedev is Chairman of Gazprom leaves little doubt about the Kremlin determination to maintain an iron grip on the energy sector
But the asymmetry in European UnionRussian energy relations must end
Concerns in the EU over energy security fueled by increasing dependence on Russia have never been greater
Together with the Russian authorities expropriation of oil company Yukos foreigners have been squeezed out of Russia energy extraction sector
Inevitably many in Europe are questioning the value of the Kremlin word
Rather than turning away the EU should seek deeper engagement and reciprocity
It should facilitate further incorporation of Gazprom into the EU market through market liberalization and downstream integration
Yet it must also press for Gazprom ultimate restructuring and real market entry into Russia for European companies because Russia unwillingness to do so guarantees energy insecurity for Europe
Indeed the Putin administration established a track record of bending rules and bullying foreign investors with the support of prosecutors tax authorities regulatory agencies and courts
At the same time Gazprom has evolved into the dominant marketmaker in gas for Europe and its actions have made a mockery of EU efforts at greater collaboration with Russia
Gazprom strategy deploys three tactics cooptation  cultivating partnerships with certain countries political leaders and corporations as levers of its interests preemption  using upstream power and Russian diplomacy to manipulate downstream conditions and scoop up assets and disaggregation  dividing the EU through bilateral deals
Gazprom cooptation of Europe has been achieved mainly through Germany where its partnerships with energy companies and banks have helped align the authorities with Russian aims
Extensive lobbying directly and by proxy is underway to persuade European regulators to allow longterm supply contracts in the EU  despite their deadening effect on competition
Preemption by Gazprom has been accomplished through a raft of acquisitions
Gazprom has flooded the market in Turkey withheld gas in Ukraine threatened to do so in Belarus and offered preferential market access to willing partners such as Italy
In the Caucasus the Kremlin has prevented Iran from establishing infrastructure to compete as a supplier of gas to Europe
To stop Iran gas Russia effectively bought Armenia entire energy sector while its support for Iran nuclear program helps maintain Iranian isolation keeping away the Western money Iran would need to become a rival gas exporter
Gazprom dominance is reinforced by activities coordinated with the Kremlin to assert its influence in markets like Spain and Italy
In exchange for gas deals with rival suppliers such as Algeria Russia has offered vast concessions on arms and preferential debt terms
In other cases the Kremlin acts punitively as when it cut off oil supplies to Lithuania following the sale of the Mazeikiu Nafta refinery to a Polish company or to Ukraine after its people voted for the rong party
The prime example of disaggregation is the Nord Stream pipeline which appeals to Germany while angering Poland and the Baltic countries
The undersea pipeline will cost three times as much as a new pipeline along existing land routes undermines the energy security of Germany eastern neighbors and threatens the Baltic Sea fragile ecosystem
But by delivering exports directly to Germany Russia will be able to cut off gas to Ukraine Poland and the Baltic states without directly affecting West European supplies  and Russia recent behavior indicates that this is a real threat
But Gazprom is worried about its upstream capabilities as is evident from the decision to divert gas from its Shtokman field to Europe rather than liquify it for new North American markets
As long as Gazprom remains opaque Europe cannot know whether its key supplier is spending enough to develop future reserves
The Kremlin political battle to win control of Russia energy sector has resulted in a dramatic reduction in the growth rate of domestic oil and gas production
That is a problem for Europe
Gazprom cannot be a partner to Europe if it does not invest in its own infrastructure yet plays a leading role in stripping Russian private businesses invests  billion in noncore assets such as news media and is run from the Office of the Presidential Administration
The lights must not go out across Europe
Brussels must demand transparency symmetry and the rule of law from Moscow with the goal being a revolutionary integration of European and Russian energy markets
Simultaneously through the diversification of supply sources massive investments in liquified natural gas LNG and a strong push in favor of the Nabucco pipeline and interconnectors between the Mediterranean rim countries Europe can move closer toward energy security
The very downstream access Gazprom wants in Europe is the EU trump card
The EU should tell Gazprom that access to Europe downstream assets is conditional on the reciprocal openness of Russia energy sector
The result would be a welcome place in the European energy market for a Russia that is both trusted and respected by its international partners
The Genetic Temptation
A gene for social skills we are told has now entered the fast growing Pantheon of genes for various human behaviors and dispositionstaking its place alongside genes for risktaking happiness aggression and sexual orientation among others
One gets the impression that we are well on the way to figuring ourselves out and that we are far simpler than anyone imagined
After all adeptness at cocktail party conversationor addiction to the cocktailsmay be no less genetically determined than hair color 
Defining the role that genes play in behavior however is not so easy
Many of the results of human studies are highly preliminary and do not actually identify a gene
In fact they cannot for genetic experimentation on humans is impossible
Even in animals whose genes are more easily studied and much better understood such as 
 Drosophila
  the tiny fruit fly there is no simple onetoone correspondence between gene and behavioral trait
Instead a wide variety of genes influence each characteristic 
Fruit fly genes are surprisingly similar to oursas they are to those of most other creatures
Even many aspects of their behavior resemble our own
For example when training a fruit fly to prefer one odor to another in a simple learning task it will remember better if trained at repeated intervals over a long time rather than in one intense session
Fruit flies are not geniuses but cramming works no better for them than it does for us
Even more recently scientists at the Neurosciences Institute in San Diego have shown that according to all essential definitional criteria fruit flies sleep at night 
But those of us who study how genes affect behavior are humbled by the fruit flys complexity
Moreover fruit flies exhibit this complexity under conditions in which nurture is kept constanta condition that is never true of humans
If the relationship between fruit fly genes and behavior is so complex can it be any less so with humans 
The view that an individual gene could account for a complete biological trait is as old as genetics itself
Whether describing genes for the color of flowers in pea plants or the shape of the fruit flys wings geneticists at the beginning of the last century believed that each gene governed one unique characteristic
Soon a few of the early geneticists founders of the Eugenics movement made the odious assertion that licentiousness shiftlessness and criminality could all be attributed to individual genes as well 
As time passed and scientific knowledge accumulatedmuch of it from the fruit flythe true complexity of the relationship between genes and characteristics became clear
By the s most geneticists had abandoned the idea of a single gene for each characteristic and were loath to ascribe human behavior solely to genes
Those in the Eugenics movement remained holdouts convinced that the salvation of the human race would be found in limiting the birthrate of those they deemed to be genetically unfit 
We are now in the midst of an explosion of genetic information
New technologies are uncovering more genes every day and comprehensive lists have been drawn up for worms mice and humans
But these species behavior no less than that of the fruit fly is the product of a vast array of genes none of which acts in isolation
Genes influence each other and are in turn influenced by the surrounding world
The result is always a unique individual 
The reason for this is simple
Any creature that reproduces sexually is made up of a unique combination of its species gene set which it inherits from its parents
All humans for example have the same set of genesthe same genetic contextbut not exactly the same versions of each gene
The exceptions to this in any species are identical twins and clones
These slight variations are part of what makes each of us different from other members of our species
The importance of genetic context has been shown in studies of behavioral mutants in fruit flies and mice
The same mutation may have a strong effect in one genetic context but not in another 
Beyond genetics all creatures experience a nonidentical sequence of life events
This is as true for genetically identical bacteria growing in a uniform environment as it is for a person living in Paris Tokyo Moscow or Buenos Aires
Granted the differences between any two Muscovites experiences are greater than the differences between the experiences of any two bacteria in a test tube culture
But that is just the point
Genetically identical bacteria represent an extreme case
We expect them to be uniform
So if contingency holds for them then it certainly holds for us 
Genes enable life but they clearly do not determine it
So the real issue is not whether we humans are servants of our genes but rather our infatuation with the idea that our behavior could so easily be explained and predicted
Perhaps we should not be so eager to be relieved of the burden of reflection evaluation and choicein short of grappling with what lies at the true heart of our humanity 
The Geoengineering Temptation
NEW BRUNSWICK  Let be clear manmade global warming is real
As a result of all the carbon dioxide methane soot and other substances that we human beings pump into the atmosphere every year global average temperatures have been rising over the past halfcentury 
While some northern countries relish the prospect of extracting minerals from an icefree Arctic Ocean and using the Northwest Passage global warming is not good for most of the planet
After all it means continued sealevel rise stronger storms and more frequent flooding drier and longerlasting droughts enhanced heatstress episodes ocean acidification destroying corals and other sea life and the northward migration of malarial mosquitoes and pine beetles
Moreover fundamental threats to the food and water supply  especially food in the tropics and water in the subtropics  are coming if we continue business as usual
Unlike the questions surrounding climate change and its consequences all of which can be answered by scientists what we want to do about it depends on values  that is what is important to us
The choices singly or in combination are  nothing the current response  mitigation reducing emissions of greenhouse gases  attempted adaptation to the ongoing climate changes and  geoengineering
If you are a big oil or coal company your choice will be nothing
You would choose to continue to make as much money as possible while the consumers of your products use the atmosphere as a sewer with no sewerage charge
And you would spend money on publicrelations firms and charlatans to try to confuse the public about the science so that you could continue this as long as possible just like tobacco companies did recently about the safety of smoking
Indeed you would use some of the same firms and charlatans
But if you are like me and want to minimize the damage to people and all other living things on Earth then you choose mitigation and where necessary adaptation
As for geoengineering we do not yet have enough information to decide but preliminary studies show that it presents more problems than it solves
There are basically two quite different and separate types of actions that have been labeled geoengineering
One carbon dioxide reduction CDR involves removing from the atmosphere the main gas that is causing global warming
In general this is a good idea but so far it seems rather expensive and nobody has yet designed a system to then sequester the carbon and keep it out of the atmosphere
CDR proposals include artificial trees that use chemicals to capture the CO and then pump it underground or under the ocean planting fastgrowing trees and then burying them and fertilizing the ocean with iron to make plankton grow faster hoping they will fall to the ocean bottom
This last idea has not been shown to work and may severely damage the entire ocean ecosystem but the first two are being worked on
The other geoengineering idea solar radiation management SRM envisions cooling Earth by putting mirrors in space pumping salt spray from ships into clouds to make them brighter or filling the stratosphere with a sulfuric acid cloud just as volcanic eruptions occasionally do
But volcanic eruptions teach us that while a cloud in the stratosphere would indeed cool the planet and stop ice from melting and the sea from rising it would also destroy ozone and produce regional droughts
There are other potential problems with SRM in the stratosphere
For example it would do nothing to stop ocean acidification
More importantly there is no way for us to decide what temperature Earth should be
Whose hand would be on the thermostat
What if Russia and Canada wanted Earth to be warmer and sinking islands in the Indian Ocean and Pacific want it to be cooler
What if the technology was used for military purposes or a big multinational corporation had a large role
Would you be happy with no more blue skies but nice yellow and red sunsets or never being able to see the Milky Way
If we somehow lost the will or means to continue to produce the stratospheric cloud temperatures would skyrocket much faster than they are increasing now
All this underscores the need for further study
We have to be able to quantify the benefits risks and costs of geoengineering and compare them to the benefits risks and costs of our other options so that we can make an informed decision
SRM might be needed in a planetary emergency  say if continued warming rapidly accelerates icesheet melting and sealevel rise or if it accelerates methane and CO emissions from thawing tundra which would then accelerate the warming itself
But geoengineering is not a magic solution to global warming
Right now it looks even more dangerous
So we must redouble our efforts to shift our economies to a postcarbon world while still allowing the billions of people without adequate food water and education to improve their lives
This offers tremendous economic opportunities if we can just put a price on the dangers to the planet of current carbon emissions
So long as governments begin to push the world in this direction we have a good chance to save our planet without geoengineering
The Geopolitical Consequences of the Financial Crisis
PRINCETON  Worried investors and policymakers are becoming obsessed with Great Depression analogies
But the lesson of  is only in part financial or economic The  crisis was so big and so destructive because it was a financial drama that played out on a geopolitical stage
Two surprising conclusions are emerging in today discussions but only one has been fully digested
First big public sector action is needed Second such action is complicated because in a globalized world the need for assistance spans borders
First private sector solutions have been tried but have failed in a breathtakingly short space of time
The most frequent consolation in this failure is that a really bad crisis is purgative
Insolvent businesses close bad loans are written off and lenders can lend with new confidence again
Hank Paulson who came to America Treasury from the strongest US investment bank Goldman Sachs made the purgation gamble in allowing Lehman Brothers to go under He argued that the US could not tolerate a bailout culture
A firm denial by the government should be seen as a sign that most of the American economy is fundamentally sound and that American financial markets are sophisticated enough to be able to identify sound business practices
America Treasury Secretary in the Great Depression was also a titan of finance Andrew Mellon Mellon immediate conclusion in the face of the  stock market panic has subsequently become notorious iquidate labor liquidate stocks liquidate the farmers liquidate real estate purge the rottenness out of the system
It is already clear that the high risk bet of  has not paid off any more than it did in  On the contrary the failure to perform one rescue has made more rescues necessary of AIG of HBOS in Britain That is unlikely to be the end There are lists circulating of which institution is next on the ladder to fall off  or be picked off The most appropriate analogy for this kind of mood is Agatha Christie nd Then There Were None  in which each murder produces more paranoia
In a financial system that has become so demented only institutions with more or less infinite resources can stem the tide Such institutions can conceivably be selfhelp organizations such as pools of powerful banks The US Treasury indeed tried to put together such a pool on Sunday September th
But in a climate of profound uncertainty selfhelp is not enough Governments or central banks are needed because only they are both big and quick enough
Only they could quickly come to the assistance of the giant housing finance institutions US Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and then deal with AIG
The second question is what kind of government can do the job
Not just any government will do Midsized European governments can possibly rescue midsized European institutions but in the case of really major financial conglomerates at the heart of the world financial system there are probably only two governments that have the fire power the US and China
In the similar circumstances of a financial meltdown in  there were also only a limited number of governments that could be effective The old economic superpower Britain was too exhausted and strained to help anyone else World reserves were massively accumulated in the US
Thus the only plausible case for a way out of the worldwide Great Depression in  lay as the great economic historian Charles Kindleberger emphasized with some step from the US At the time there were all kinds of convincing reasons why Americans should not want to take on the burden of a worldwide rescue sending more money to Europe might be seen as pouring money down a drain had not the Europeans fought a World War that had been the fount and origin of the financial mess Economically such action would have made a great deal of sense from a long term perspective but politically it was a nonstarter with no short term payoff at all
China is the America of this century The initial stages of the credit crunch in  were managed so apparently painlessly because sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East but above all from China were willing to step in and recapitalize the debt of American and European institutions The pivotal moment in today events came when the Chinese SWF China Investment Co was unwilling to go further in its exploration of buying Lehman Brothers CIC turning back will be held up in the future as a moment when history could have turned in a different direction
Now there will be plenty of reasons why the Chinese pulled back
The logic sounds like the American case of  Some of the arguments that are reverberating around Beijing are very reasonable there is a great deal of uncertainty and the SWFs might lose a lot of money
CIC would have initially lost some money with Lehman
Some lines of thought are more emotional might not  be a payback for the American bungling of the  East Asia crisis
We are about to see what stake China really has in the survival of the globalized world economy As in  the political arguments are all against such an operation Only the farsighted will see that the economic case for a rescue is compelling
The Geopolitical Message from Libya
NEW DELHI  Will ission creep in the West intervention in Libya end up creating inadvertently a jihadist citadel at Europe southern doorstep
Of course the Western powers must be applauded for their efforts with the support of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to prevent a slaughter of Libya civilian population
The democratic world should never stand by idly while a tyrant uses military force to massacre civilians
But if despots are to be deterred from untrammeled repression any intervention  whether military or in the form of economic and diplomatic sanctions  must meet the test of impartiality
The current political upheaval in the Arab world could transform the Middle East and North Africa in the same way that the fall of the Berlin Wall in  fundamentally changed Europe
Indeed  was a watershed producing the most profound global geopolitical changes in the most compressed timeframe in history
But in the decades since the Arab world rulers regimes and practices seemed to have remained firmly entrenched
In  Francis Fukuyama claimed in a famous essay that the Cold War end marked the end of ideological evolution he end of history with the niversalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government
Yet two decades on the global spread of democracy has been encountering increasingly strong headwinds
Only a small minority of states in Asia for example are true democracies
In fact a new bipolar Cold Warstyle ideological divide has emerged
The rise of authoritarian capitalism  best symbolized by China but also embraced by countries as disparate as Malaysia Singapore Kazakhstan and Qatar  has created a new model that competes with and challenges liberal democracy
The popular upsurge in the Arab world shows that democratic empowerment hinges on two key internal factors the role of security forces and the technological sophistication of the state repressive capacity
In recent weeks security forces have shaped developments in different ways in three Arab states
Yemen popular uprising has splintered the security establishment with different military factions now in charge of different neighborhoods in the capital Sana
In Bahrain by contrast the monarchy has used the foreign Sunni mercenaries that dominate its police force to fire on demonstrators who are predominantly Shia
In Egypt it was the military refusal to side with former President Hosni Mubarak that helped end his year dictatorship
Long used to wielding power the military had become increasingly wary of Mubarak efforts to groom his son as his successor
Yet today heady talk of freedom cannot obscure the reality that the people evolution has so far led only to a direct military takeover with the decadesold emergency law still in force and the country political direction uncertain
As for the second key internal factor a state ability to police mobile and electronic communications and Internet access has become as important as jackboots and truncheons
China for example is a model of despotic efficiency its internalsecurity system extends from stateoftheart surveillance and extralegal detention centers to an army of paid informants and neighborhood patrols that looks out for troublemakers
In response to calls by some overseas Chinese for people to gather on Sundays at specific sites in Shanghai and Beijing to help launch a molihua jasmine revolution China has revealed a new strategy preemptively flood the protestdesignated squares with police to leave no room for protesters
More importantly as the world leader in stringent realtime censorship of electronic communications China is strongly placed to block any Arab contagion from reaching its shores
External factors are especially important in smaller weaker countries
Nothing illustrates this better than Bahrain where Saudi Arabia  which has contributed more than any other country to the spread of global jihad  sent forces under the Gulf Cooperation Council banner to crush peaceful protests
Indeed Saudi Arabia effort to prop up the Bahraini regime parallels the Soviet Union intervention in Afghanistan in  to bolster a besieged allied regime  an invasion that led to the multibilliondollar CIAscripted arming of Afghan rebels and the consequent rise of transnational Islamic terrorists
Libya too is a weak divided country
Indeed with the CIA conducting covert operations inside Libya and aiding the rebels there the danger is that the West could be creating another jihadist haven
After all the broadening of the NATOled mission from a limited humanitarian goal to an allout assault on Libya military signals to some Arabs that this war is really about ensuring that the region does not slip out of Western control
The intervention has seemingly been driven by a geopolitical imperative to bottle up or eliminate Col Muammar elQaddafi so that his regime cannot exploit the political vacuum in neighboring Egypt and Tunisia
While it is now clear that much of the Arab world is in transition the end point is not yet clear
But Barack Obama administration apparently has concluded that Arab monarchs are likely to survive whereas Arab presidents are more likely to fall and that it is acceptable for the United States to continue to coddle tyrannical kings
Unfortunately this double standard sends a message that democratic empowerment in any society is possible only if it is in the interest of the great powers
No one has a greater interest in broad acceptance of this noxious idea  that promotion of human freedom is nothing more than a geopolitical tool  than the world largest oldest and most powerful autocracy China
The Geopolitics of Football
In football defeat is never definitive but it is always passionate
For football lovers FIFA the governing body of international football should have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize long ago
For others exasperated by football and the emotions it stirs up the sport is no longer a game but a type of war that stokes the basest sort of nationalist emotions
Is there a relationship between football and sports in general and a spirit of nationalism and militarism
During the Middle Ages sports were regularly forbidden in England because they came at the expense of military training
After France defeat by Bismarck Germany in the FrancoPrussian War Baron Pierre de Coubertin who relaunched the Olympic Games a few decades later recommended a renewed national emphasis on sport which by this point was seen as a form of military preparation
In a football match the rituals  the flag waving the national anthems the collective chants nd the language that is employed the match starts with a reakout of hostilities one ombs the goal blows up the defense launches issile reinforce the perception of war by other means
And in fact real war has actually broken out over football
In  Honduras and Salvador clashed after a qualification game for the World Cup
Football matches can it seems revive national rivalries and conjure the ghosts of past wars
During the  Asia Nations Cup final which pitted China against Japan Chinese supporters wore style Japanese military uniforms to express their hostility to the Japanese team
Other Chinese fans brandished placards with the number  written on it a reference to the number of Chinese murdered by the Japanese army in 
But can one really say that football is responsible for the currently bad diplomatic relations between China and Japan
Of course not
Hostility on the football pitch merely reflects the existing tense relations between the two countries which carry the weight of a painful history
At the opposite end of the spectrum the dramatic semifinal between France and Germany in Seville in  produced no political ripples either for diplomatic relations between the two countries or for relations between the two peoples
Antagonism was confined to the stadium and ended when the match did
What football really provides is a residual area of confrontation that allows for the controlled expression of animosity leaving the most important areas of interaction between countries unaffected
France and Germany will soon have a common army  they already have a common currency  yet the survival of national teams channels within a strictly limited framework lingering rivalry between the two countries
Football can also be the occasion of positive gestures
The joint organization of the  World Cup by Japan and South Korea helped accelerate bilateral reconciliation
The performance of the South Korean players was even applauded in North Korea
Sport indeed seems to be the best barometer of relations between the divided Korean people
Moreover football more than long speeches or international resolutions can help induce progress towards peaceful solutions for military conflicts
After their qualification for this year World Cup the Ivory Coast national team including players from the north and south addressed all of their fellow citizens asking the warring factions to lay down their weapons and to put an end to the conflict that has shattered their country
After Haiti President JeanBertrand Aristide was overthrown a few years ago Brazil football team acted as an ambassador for the United Nations Brazilianled peacekeeping forces
And when conflict stops from Kosovo to Kabul football is the first sign of a society returning to normal
The former president of the FIFA Joao Havelange often dreamed of a football match between Israelis and Palestinians the American vicepresident Al Gore regarded such a match as a means to help Washington solve the IsraeliPalestinian conflict
Perhaps one day it will take place
Certainly the IranUnited States football game in  offered a moment of fraternization between the two teams
Another IranUS match might be helpful at this difficult time
It is because football allows for symbolically limited confrontations with no major political risks that it is useful
Its impact on national and international public opinion is broad but not deep
As the sociologist Norbert Elias put it he spectators of a football match can enjoy the mythical excitement of battles taking place in the stadium and they know that neither the players nor they will suffer any harm
As in real life fans can be torn between their hopes for victory and their fear of defeat
But in football the elimination of an adversary is always temporary
A return match is always possible
As a Frenchman I cannot wait for the next World Cup match between France and Germany
But I want France to avenge its defeat at the last World Cup in Seville not its defeat at Verdun
Germany Case Against the ECB
MUNICH  Germany Constitutional Court is preparing what might become the most important decision in its history
Last September the court allowed the German government to sign the Treaty Establishing the European Stability Mechanism ESM the eurozone permanent intergovernmental rescue facility
Now however it may try to stop the European Central Bank socalled outright monetary transactions OMT program the ECB pledge to buy without limit the government bonds of troubled eurozone countries that subject themselves to the ESM conditions
To be sure the German court has no jurisdiction over the ECB  and thus has no power to judge its actions
The only institution that does have that power is the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg
But Germany Constitutional Court can judge whether the actions of EU institutions are compatible with its constitution and the European Union treaties
If the court finds that the ECB actions are unlawful it can constrain German institutions  even the German parliament
For example it could forbid the Bundesbank from participating in the OMT program
Or it could rule that the German government participation in the ESM must be conditional on the ECB willingness to limit OMTs
Udo Di Fabio a renowned former judge on the court has argued that the tribunal could even force the German government to unwind the EU treaties if it does not succeed in curbing the OMT program
The OMT program supporters point out that it has calmed the financial markets by affirming the ECB readiness to step in as a lender of last resort and buy sovereign debt before a country goes bust
By driving the market to a socalled ood equilibrium such a country yields remain low and it can continue to borrow
They point out that central banks all over the world are undertaking similar actions to stabilize markets
The Federal Reserve in particular has bought huge quantities of US government bonds
Opponents point out that that is exactly the problem because the ECB mandate is more limited than the Fed
After all the eurozone is not a federal country and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article  in particular explicitly forbids monetary financing of the member states which was Germany condition for giving up the Deutschmark
Moreover the opponents argue even the Fed does not buy bonds issued by troubled US states such as California or Illinois
Proponents of OMT counter that the Treaty forbids only direct government bond purchases indirect purchases in secondary markets are allowed
But the decision not to prohibit indirect purchases opponents argue may have been intended to allow the ECB to carry out weekly repo operations following a practice used by the Banque de France to reduce fluctuations in shortterm interest rates
It was not a mandate to buy or announce to buy sizeable stocks of bonds in order to reduce longterm interest rates
Moreover not forbidding indirect purchases should be seen primarily as a means of permitting banks that buy government bonds to pledge them as collateral for refinancing operations while bearing the full investment risk
The distinction between bond purchases from the government and from the banks that bought them from the government is a phony one that gives rise to myriad possibilities for circumvention
A major concern of the German Constitutional Court is the similarity between the ESM Secondary Market Support Facility SMSF and the ECB OMT program both of which imply the purchase of government bonds in secondary markets
The two schemes are being carried out under nearly identical conditions  requiring the ESM approval of a country reform program  and neither has been triggered so far
But the SMSF ability to provide financing is indirectly capped by member states maximum liability at  billion  billion after the Constitutional Court excluded joint and several liability in its September  ruling Germany maximum liability stands at  billion
By contrast the OMT program is unconstrained
Because ECB losses result in seigniorage losses for the respective national treasuries in a way similar to ESM losses the OMT program obviously undermines the ESM ruling by increasing the liability risk beyond the level approved by parliaments
The similarity between the SMSF and OMTs also implies that at least one of the two institutions is exceeding its mandate
If governmentbond purchases are monetary operations as the ECB claims the ESM is overreaching if they are fiscal operations it is the ECB that has crossed the line
According to this logic at least one of the institutions is acting unlawfully
Because the Constitutional Court has already given a green light to the ESM SMSF program how it will rule on the OMT program should be clear
However in courts as in the open sea predictions often prove unreliable

The German Hour
BRUSSELS  A series of developments over the last few weeks have set in motion a downward spiral for the eurozone
Unless officials especially German officials act fast the verdict of financial markets is bound to be ruthless
First the eurozone has failed to turn the tide
Mario Draghi President of the European Central Bank was right to note that despite numerous ministerial meetings and three summits implementation of the decision to increase significantly the firepower of the European Financial Stability Facility EFSF is still lacking
There are now growing doubts about the effectiveness of the EFSF
Second and partly as a consequence virtually all eurozone countries debt is trading at a discount relative to German Bunds
While it was necessary to price risk more accurately it is difficult to believe that the Netherlands with a debt ratio nearly  percentage points lower than Germany deserves to be assessed as a higher default risk
But now even the mighty Bund has started to suffer from heightened market anxiety
Third financialmarket participants and increasingly real businesses are pricing in a possible breakup of the eurozone if not the end of the euro itself
It is still difficult to think the unthinkable let alone work out the details of it but any rational player must now consider the possibility
If expectations of disaster build and a growing number of players start positioning themselves to protect themselves the consequences could become overwhelming
Not only the eurozone would suffer
Fourth Germany has become the eurozone undisputed leader
Although France continues to play its role as the other half of the European Union leading couple it has lost influence and the ability to take the initiative
A weaker French economy shakier public finances and the coming presidential election are all combining to alter the balance with Germany
Political audacity can carry France only so far
In this context Germany again finds itself in a situation akin to that of the late  when the Bundesbank was setting monetary policy for the rest of the continent
At that time German Chancellor Helmut Kohl wisely concluded that German economic dominance of Europe was not conducive to a stable equilibrium and that a better plan for the future was to build on Germany weight and influence to create a permanent common monetary order
Kohl insight gave birth to the euro
Today once again it is in Germany best interest to ensure lasting stability in Europe
With foreign assets worth  trillion  trillion most of which consist of claims on its eurozone partners Germany would lose out massively if the eurozone fragments
Claims on entities within partner countries would be redenominated in weaker currencies  or the borrowers would default on them
Obviously German exporters would be hurt by substantial currency appreciation
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has sensibly decided to take the lead on reforming the eurozone
But many Germans feel deceived by some irresponsible eurozone partners giving rise to the temptation to use Germany current strength to toughen sanctions and coerce weaker countries into adopting constitutional changes especially concerning fiscal policy
This is a risky attitude
To be sure Germany has far more leverage today than it has had at any point in the last  years
But attempting to extract unilateral concessions from partners is a recipe for disappointment
It is one thing is to be sanctioned for breaching the rules as with the Stability and Growth Pact it is quite another thing to permit elected national governments and parliaments to be overruled and national budgets censored by an unelected higher authority
The EU members are unlikely to agree to major reform unless Germany offers something in return
Absent a more balanced deal what is likely to emerge from negotiations is simply another layer of largely ineffectual and ultimately divisive sanctions
The natural quid pro quo for ex ante budgetary control is solidarity through the creation of Eurobonds
Joint and several liability for public bonds is imaginable only if countries offering their guarantee  and thus potential access to their taxpayers  can exercise veto power and prevent a partner country from issuing more debt
Thus legally binding ex ante control is a necessary condition for Eurobonds
Conversely surrendering budgetary sovereignty to eurozone partners is acceptable only if it accompanies their guarantee that they will come to the rescue in case of accident
Germany should be bold and use its leverage to offer a new contract to its eurozone partners mutual guarantee of part of their public debt in exchange for strict debt limits and a new legal order in which a eurozone authority can veto an enacted budget even before it is implemented
Only such boldness will deliver the certainty that markets need  and it is Germany responsibility to be bold
The German Tortoise and the American Hare
CAMBRIDGE For almost a decade Germany has searched its soul about its economic viability
Is there too little flexibility in our labor markets
Are wages too high
Is there too much regulation
How can German firms which should be worldbeaters succeed if they have to fight with one arm tied behind their back by their very own government and workers
Of course one would not want American ways of doing business imported here
Still things have got to change
But the talk drones on and on without any change being decided upon
For a brief moment earlier this year the debate came to a grinding stop as former finance minister Oskar Lafontaine jerked the questioning onto entirely different grounds
Squeeze big business that was Oskars answer to Germanys dilemma
But it did take long before the corporatism underpinning Germanys economic model reasserted itself
Lafontaines brief and turbulent bid for mastery in Germany and his spectacular crash opened a rare opportunity to see how the countrys domestic interests are really aligned what can happen and what must not take place
Lafontaine it seems had forgot that the deepest belief of German social democracy is dont rock the boat
Dont rock the boat stepping on the toes of big business which was Lafontaines error nor on union sensibilities as Chancellor Schroeder almost did as he dickered about making a ThatcherBlair style bid to reshape Germanys economy
The Economist indeed recently asked if Germany and Europe are really doing so bad in comparison with the United States
Over the past  decades America has had higher growth and higher productivity growth
But have living standards in the US raced ahead
If they havent isnt it all the talk about the new American model just hype and bubble
Indeed perhaps it is even a dangerous hype
Perhaps it is even possible to argue that Germanys and Europes lack of competition and flexibility are the very attributes that produce long term economic performance
Perhaps the world economy is at a turning point just ahead of the American bubble bursting at last so that it is even now possible to put the US success in perspective as something that obviously could not last not with Americas big external deficits scant household savings and prosperity driven by paper wealth
If we accept sheer GDP growth as the bottom line yes the US has done better over the past  years  on average versus  in Germany
But that is hardly something to write home about
Even if it means that over say half a century it makes for a  difference the gap is nice but not spectacular
But the difference goes further America has overcome its  enemy of the past inflation while Germany has lost the battle against its great enemy unemployment
Joblessness in Germany seems here to stay
The US has won its battle against its enemy  the budget deficits that ballooned under President Reagan
Today the US is running surpluses and is seeing a rapidly falling debt ratio while Germany by contrast has just negotiated a truce called the Waigel Pact
Third and most importantly America has created vast public enthusiasm for capitalism and selfresponsibility while in Germany the government is still expected to be the answer of last resort
In Germany ministers and the entire civil service bank on the premise that there is such a thing as a knowledgeable society and that a country with a good education has a seat in the front row
They have not figured out that even more important than high school education or a university degree is selfreliance initiative and entrepreneurship without these attributes education is like a car on square wheels
It looks like the real thing but it wont move
There is a nasty little story of one of Germanys megabusinesses that went shopping to buy a high tech boutique in the US
The domestic staff back home revolted we can do the same things the Americans do
Asked why they didnt the staff replied nobody asked us
Of course no generalization can do better than describe the average
But today Germany like Japan is merely a finalist in midlevel technology
But the shift to the frontier of cool and soft and high tech defies Germanys disciplined and ingrained engineering culture the organization of business where administrators predominate over greedy entrepreneurs
The Ghost in the Recovery Machine
NEW HAVEN  The International Monetary Fund October World Economic Outlook proclaimed that trong public policies have fostered a rebound of industrial production world trade and retail sales
The IMF along with many national leaders seem ready to give full credit to these policies for engineering what might be the end of the global economic recession
National leaders and international organizations do deserve substantial credit for what has been done to bring about signs of recovery since the spring
The international coordination of world economic policies as formalized in the recent G statement is unprecedented in history
But one also suspects that world leaders have been too quick to claim so much credit for their policies
After all recessions generally tend to come to an end on their own even before there were government stabilization policies
For example in the United States the recessions of            and  all ended without help from the Federal Reserve which opened its doors only in 
Economic theorists long ago developed models that describe how recessions end on their own
In his  book The Business Cycle  in a chapter entitled he Lower Turning Point Cambridge University economist R C O Matthews summarized a host of factors that businesscycle theorists of his day argued tend to bring on recovery automatically
For example demand for investment goods may rebound especially in certain hardhit sectors after a recession has caused physical capital to become technologically obsolete
Moreover interest rates tend to decline in a recession even if there is no central bank stimulating investment demand further
Similarly manufacturing can expand to restore inventories depleted by overcontraction of output while random shocks such as major innovations or harvest variations may have an asymmetric effect in a recession with upward shocks in some sectors having a greater impact than the downward shocks in others
On the financial front the failure of weaker banks in a recession leaves survivors that benefit from greater public confidence and are therefore able to resume profitable business
Some of these factors rather than just the actions taken by governments and multilateral organizations plausibly played a role in the current economic improvement
Unpredictable human psychology also plays a role
Such factors indeed matter very much for the economic outlook and for judging the success of the recovery program
One can start with the stockmarket turnaround since March of this year which has been stunning
Using monthly SampampP Composite data the  increase from March to September was the secondlargest sixmonth increase since  surpassed only by a  increase from February to August  during the Great Depression
This rebound is all the more remarkable given that it followed the secondlargest sixmonth decrease ever as stock prices fell  from September  to March 
The largest sixmonth decrease was you guessed it during the Great Depression when the index fell  from November  to May 
Moreover this same sharp turnaround occurred in many countries  and for many assets including oil prices gold and in some countries residential real estate
Any solid understanding of the causes of this turnaround is likely to prove elusive
People are still puzzling over the reasons for other major market upturns   etc
A market boom once started can continue for a while as a sort of social epidemic and can foster inspiring ew era stories that are spread by news media and word of mouth
The stories themselves help magnify the boom becoming part of the feedback that sustains it
The agreements reached at recent G meetings stand as one of these stories for they suggest a new era of international cooperation and economic professionalism  a narrative that has probably been exaggerated in the psychology of recovery
The G story is particularly salient in the developing world for the international recognition that the G expanded role has given to developing countries is highly resonant psychologically
Beyond that stories of highly profitable banks paying huge bonuses to their executives have also inspired people to think that things are not so bad in the business world
Anger at these profits and bonuses only tends to increase the contagion of the story
But any such speculative boom is inherently unstable as the stories evolve in time and with new shocks whose effect on markets is most uncertain
It was in fact an excessive speculative boom in the stock market and the housing market that got us into this financial mess in the first place
To be sure governments and multilateral institutions made some reasonable attempts to restore confidence
But they did not ngineer a recovery
They got lucky and the G as well as the governments that instituted stimulus packages are currently in a honeymoon period of apparent success
Where our stillailing world economy goes from here is as uncertain as the speculative markets that played such an important role in both the financial crisis and the recovery
We can only wish that formulating economic policy were as clearcut as say mechanical engineering
It is not a host of poorly understood natural cyclical factors play a role and so do the vagaries of human psychology
The Ghost of Appeasement
PRAGUE  One of the fundamental pillars of Europe political architecture is a strong and enduring belief in the universal validity of equal universal and inalienable human rights
At the core of this is a belief in the rights of human beings to a life of freedom and the protection of their dignity
In the years after World War II this humanist ideal became the basis of Europe spiritual and political identity and hence it is contained in the founding documents of the European Union
Of course this does not mean that the EU could or would want to conquer the rest of the world in the name of imposing its values rules and culture on the rest of humanity
Far from it
What Europe devotion to humanism does mean however is a determination no matter the circumstances to stand firm and not abandon the fundamentals of European civilization and European unification
As a result Europe places a primary emphasis on the universality of human rights and freedoms
To be sure there are many places around the globe where human rights and civil liberties continue to be trampled underfoot North Korea Iran Burma Tibet Zimbabwe and many others
This week a meeting of the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council GAERC will discuss once more relations between the EU and Cuba
Despite repeated reminders from the EU the Cuban government has done none of the things that the Union has been urging it to do for many years  above all to release all political prisoners and stop the persecution of independent civilsociety groups and the regime political opponents
On the contrary the Cuban government continues to detain prisoners of conscience and to criminalize demands for a societywide dialogue
This year the peoples of Europe are marking the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the Iron Curtain that once divided Europe in two
That  years after this epochal event an iron curtain remains around Cuba makes this anniversary poignant
Of course the tourists who crowd Cuba beaches are not aware of this iron curtain
But regardless of this ignorance and of its economic interests the EU should insist on the release of political prisoners and use all international institutions to bring pressure to bear on the Cuban government to respect the human and civil rights of Cuba people
During any negotiations with Cuba leaders European politicians and diplomats should remind their Cuban partners of their obligations
They should also be in contact with Cuban civil society to express their solidarity with the families of the political prisoners
From its own experiences in the twentieth century Europe knows what catastrophes can result when concessions are made to evil
The history of the twentieth century is an object lesson in this
Time and again Europe paid a high price for policies of compromises with evil that were dictated by economic interests or the illusion that evil can be appeased and will disappear of its own accord
The EU should not and must not repeat this error
The Ghost of Biafra
When Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo made his surprise announcement on  January to begin a nationwide dialogue to discuss constitutional reform he was bowing to the inevitable
The clamor by disaffected politicians and human rights activists for such a conference had reached a crescendo
Obasanjo and the ruling Peoples Democratic Party were reelected in May  in controversial circumstances
Opposition forces led by Muhammadu Buhari the candidate of the All Nigeria People Party accused Obasanjo of using the police to intimidate voters and falsify the election results
Initially it looked like Obasanjo would weather the storm and serve out his last term without making concessions to his opponents
However in late December  the national election tribunal sitting in Abuja the capital ruled that while the election had been free and fair in most parts of the country the number of votes was larger than the population in Ogun the President home state
The opposition seized on the ruling and called on Obasanjo to resign
Simultaneously the eastern part of the country descended into anarchy
Political thugs linked to the president resorted to strongarm tactics in an attempt to remove one of the governors angry that he had not given them lucrative public contracts
Obasanjo refused to call them to order even after they invaded and razed government offices
In the Niger delta where oil production and official neglect have devastated the environment and wrecked livelihoods enraged youths took to the swamps and led an insurgency against Federal troops
But the most powerful push for the conference came from politicians in the largely Christian south apprehensive that power would return to the Muslim north in  after Obasanjo himself a southern Christian completed his second term
Since political independence in  politics has revolved round Nigeria major ethnic groups  the Igbo and Yoruba in the south and the Hausa and Fulani in the north
Southerners apprehension is well founded
The north dominated the armed forces following the Biafra civil war in the late 
As military rule became the norm in Africa in the  northern army officers imposed an authoritarian and predatory mode of governance on the country a vicious grip that was loosened only when a resurgent civil society forced them to return to the barracks in 
Obasanjo election marked the return of civilian rule
The demand for a new constitution emulating Nigeria First Republic of the early  when the country was a federation of powerful regions enjoying a large measure of fiscal autonomy grew over the years as Nigeria economy plummeted
But Obasanjo is a passionate advocate of unitary government and counts many influential northerners as personal friends
The northern business and political elite see him as a bulwark against their increasingly restive southern rivals who openly threaten a repeat of the Igbo attempt to secede in  that caused the Biafra conflict taking the rich oil fields of the Niger delta with them
Obasanjo latest move his proposed ational Political Reform Conference in March is an attempt to steal the opposition thunder
There will be  delegates but the bulk of them nominated by the president and his party and the governmentcontrolled National Assembly will vet their proposals
The opposition has responded by calling on Nigerians to boycott the conference arguing that it lacks legitimacy
The opposition grouped in the ProNational Conference Organization PRONACO a new umbrella coalition of political parties and human rights groups has said it would convene an alternative national conference in June
PRONACO has formidable leaders in Wole Soyinka the Nobel literature laureate and Anthony Enahoro an elderly politician who made his name as a fiery young nationalist in the 
The group demands include dividing the country into six or eight new regions along broad ethnic lines with powers to generate and spend revenue
Opposition leaders also intend to debate such issues as the rights of women and minority groups and the place of Shari the Islamic legal code which has replaced civil courts in several northern states
Reformers also have the Obasanjo government neoliberal economic policies which they describe as unitive and intellectually bankrupt in their sights
But it is PRONACO demand that at least  of the oil revenue derived from the Niger delta and other states in the south be retained in the area of production that most threatens the survival of the country survival as a united entity
The Biafra war was largely an oil war prosecuted by northern officers and politicians to win back the delta oil fields from the Igbo
It is not likely that northern elites will stand by idly as a fresh attempt is made to take away what they consider a glittering prize
For now the north appears divided
But a hardening of the mood there and a brokered armistice between its disenchanted youth and older but vastly more experienced political war horses will not only present PRONACO with a formidable opponent but could throw West Africa into turmoil if matters degenerate into a frontal clash
The Ghost of North Korea
TOKYO  At  am on April  North Korea fired a missile which it called a satellite launch in the face of opposition from almost the entire international community
In a perverse way the world got its way because the vehicle exploded a minute after takeoff its debris falling harmlessly into the sea
North Korea typically goes silent after such episodes ailure does not exist in its political lexicon so it cannot be reported or discussed
The country media routinely meets any failure with outpourings of patriotic music and bombastic praise for the regime
But this time was different
Behind the scenes in North Korea failure does have consequences
In the coming weeks we will most likely learn of a purge of those responsible
Indeed the engineers and scientists involved in the launch probably put their lives on the line
Moreover North Korea could not deny failure this time because the regime invited international media to attend the event  even allowing foreign reporters into the missioncontrol room  in order to legitimize it as a atellite launch and not a weapons test
The ailure could not be concealed so it was quickly admitted
What was supposed to be a celebration of the th anniversary of the late Kim Jongil on April  and of the regime new beginning under his successor his youngest son Kim Jongun ended up being a funereal salute
Supposedly ordinary people in Pyongyang told foreign media with a practiced spontaneity that uccess is born of repeated failure
That is a chilling sentiment
The missile launch is believed to have been a legacy of Kim Jongil who fervently believed that the North survival required it to develop nuclear and biochemical weapons
So the failed missile launch probably means that a resumption of nuclear testing is inevitable following tests in  and 
However radioactive elements such as Krypton or Xenon were not detected in the atmosphere after previous tests
Just as the North called the recent missile a atellite an underground explosion caused by conventional explosives cannot be used as a bargaining chip unless it is called a uclear test
The next one probably will occur as soon as  tons of dynamite have been secured
The failed launch also marked a security fiasco for the North as a South Korea think tank obtained the final orders for it
These instructions casually referred to Kim family business indicating that he teachings should be executed by Kim Kyonghui Kim Jongil sister that im Kyonghui and Kim Jongun should take care of the family and that im Kyonghui should handle management of all assets inside and outside the country
Foreign media often focus on Kim Kyonghui role as the wife of regime insider Jang Sungtaek but as Kim Jongil sister she has been firmly in control of personnel changes since her brother death
Of the  members on Kim Jongil funeral committee she was listed th her husband was th
She is routinely ranked higher than her husband in terms of protocol
Indeed Jang Sungtaek promotion to General was her decision
The problem is that Kim Kyonghui is in poor health owing to years of alcohol abuse
Moreover she is so capricious and selfcentered that even Kim Jongil had trouble keeping her in check
Due to her poor health it is unclear how long she will be able to continue advising Kim Jongun now surrounded by military personnel in their seventies and eighties who supported past generations
He needs advisers closer to his own age but none is at hand
Dynastic concerns now seem to be paramount for the regime
Speculation is growing for example about whether Kim Solsong  the second daughter of Kim Jongil third wife  will be appointed when Kim Kyonghui is no longer able to perform her duties
Before his death Kim Jongil reiterated that at least three nuclear reactors should be built
He also warned that China despite being North Korea closest ally is also the country that merits the most caution
North Korea he insisted must not allow itself to be used by China
When Kim Ilsung the ternal Great Leader died in  Kim Jongil relied on his father teachings to reinforce his authority
Indeed there is no way of knowing whether his ideas and policies throughout his reign were actually Kim Ilsung
Perhaps Kim Jongil en Principles for the Establishment of the OneIdeology System should now be viewed as an official document that stipulates which instructions are to be followed when where and by whom
In that case his successor the callow Kim Jongun can claim to be bound to do as he was told
North Korea routinely pushes the international community around
But the North is itself being pushed around by the teachings of a ghost conveniently used by the people who remain in charge in Pyongyang
How long will the rest of the world allow itself to be pushed around by a ghost
The Ghost of Pinochet
The death of General Augusto Pinochet Chile former military dictator provides perhaps an appropriate end for a year that saw the Latin American left return to glory a revival that Hugo Chavez overwhelming reelection in Venezuela is but the strongest sign
For unlike in the days of Pinochet fear of the left has mostly vanished across the continent
Indeed the left has won in countries in which it has previously never held power
Despite the fact that the victories of Felipe Calderon in Mexico Alvaro Uribe in Colombia and Alan Garcia in Peru put a stop to a supposed tsunami of Socialist victories the trend toward the left is unmistakable
Chavez is no longer a lonely populist
In the Andean region he is accompanied by two clones that are reheating his recipes Evo Morales in Bolivia and Rafael Correa in Ecuador
In the rest of the continent the other left  the one deemed reliable by Wall Street and London bankers  will not join Chavez postures but neither will it join a crusade to unseat him
This other left however is not radical
The return to power from the political wilderness of Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua and Alan Garcia in Peru two of the most demonized enemies of US foreign policy during the  provides sardonic testimony to this
Ortega won thanks to an alliance with the heirs of Nicaragua old dictator Somoza
His only ideology nowadays is Daniel Ortega
Garca defeated Ollanta Humala who would have presumably joined the drift toward Chavez
That the Latin American right can sleep at night despite this leftward tide is not merely the result of communism disappearance nor does it mean that the US has given up its hegemonic intentions
The explanation lies in the fact that much of today left is not the left as we have known it
Instead today left looks at growth fiscal discipline and competitiveness with pragmatism and not as ideological red flags
Its economic proposals do not define its character it feels at ease with policies such as those followed by President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva during his first term in Brazil or those implemented by the Socialist Presidents Ricardo Lagos and Michele Bachelet in Chile
Easy applause can no longer be had by attacking big business or the IMF
Yet there is a frontier between today left and right and it is found in the realm of social issues samesex couples and marriages religious freedom abortion and female equality
These matters have been increasing in importance and are inciting a clash between the political forces that have just come to power and their conservative opposition
Foreign affairs also forms another divide
The Latin American left does not share George W Bush view of the world
On global issues it has not backed the US in the Iraq war it does not tolerate American disdain for multilateralism and it is unwilling to join the antiterror crusade
In Latin American affairs it balks at the Free Trade Area of the Americas FTAA and generally wants relations with the US that allow it to promote their local initiatives
Right leaning rulers such as President Uribe in Colombia still like to speak about their special relationship with Bush or their backing of his foreign policy
President Lula and others on the left mostly prefer to hold their tongues
Everything suggests that the new moderate Latin American left is more political than economic
And it is here where its biggest challenges will emerge
An excessive focus on growth and macroeconomic balances can lead to frustration among those sectors that are demanding better living conditions when they raised this new social democratic left to power
Education  its quality more than its coverage  was a key issue in Chile recent presidential elections
The debate over the ability of growth alone to reduce poverty has become heated
If the new left does not manage to answer these questions satisfactorily it will be seen as having failed
There is a paradox at the heart of this process the electoral victories by the left are a clear sign of democratic maturity
However even though rulers are chosen through popular vote there are worrying signs of weakness in the region democratic institutions
Presidents are too easily reelected or returned to power  Uribe Lula Chavez Ortega Garcia  with a consequent concentration of power and limits on the emergence of new leaders
Moreover the military remains politically influential in Chile Ecuador Venezuela and Colombia
Electoral systems are precarious enough to generate pathetic situations such as that which prevailed in Mexico throughout the autumn with its wo Presidents
Parties lose ground against the caudillist adventures of people like Lopez Obrador in Mexico and Chavez in Venezuela and congresses are assured only of public antipathy
Across Latin America voters  voicing their economic hopes  have opted for a new left
That left has obtained historic victories thanks to a democracy whose survival is still not guaranteed
So the ghost of Augusto Pinochet lingers
The Ghost of the Stability Pact
Murdered when France and Germany refused to abide by its rules the Stability Pacts ghost is haunting Europe particularly the postcommunist countries that join the European Union in May
By breaking the Pacts ban on fiscal deficits exceeding  of GDP France and Germany undermined this limit as a key criterion for determining whether countries are ready for eurozone membership
Would denial of admission to the eurozone because a country fails to fulfil rules that current members spurn really be legitimate
The convergence criterion on exchange rates is in similar disarray
Countries must remain within the European exchange rate mechanism ERM II for two years in order to ensure the right exchange rate when they adopt the euro
Germany satisfied the criterion with ease during  though by most measures the Deutschemark was  overvalued compared to the franc and other eurozone currencies
This damaged Germanys economy and continues to be a drag on growth in the whole eurozone
The European Commission spent the last three years trying to tighten the exchange rate criterion which would make it an insurmountable obstacle for eurozone candidates
Although the criterion requires only that countries remain within the ERMs normal fluctuation band   on either side of a central parity  the Commission says that it will base recommendations concerning candidate countries admission on whether their exchange rates remain within a  band
The final two criteria  inflation and interest rates  are also a mess
A eurozone candidates inflation must not be more than  percentage points above the average of the three best performing EU states for one year
But the three countries that prospective members can be compared to may be 
 outside 
 the eurozone
Indeed in September  the three reference countries would have been Lithuania Poland and the Czech Republic were they already members of the EU they join in May
Moreover the inflation criterion fails to allow for higher inflation in services and construction in fastergrowing countries
But such inflation represents a natural adjustment of relative prices resulting from faster growth
It harms no one and should not be penalized
Finally the interest rate criterion requires that rates on year government bonds not be more than two percentage points above the rates in the three countries performing best 
 in terms of inflation
 
Again these could easily prove to be three new EU members outside the eurozone
Here is the core problem the criteria were devised when the eurozone did not exist
Four large countries and several small ones had to be brought into nominal convergence to ensure that the anchor of a common currency did not rip their economies apart
But the small countries now wishing to join the eurozone which together make up  of the zones economy cannot impose significant damage on existing members were they to get convergence wrong let alone anything like the damage caused by Germany joining with an overvalued currency
In any case the Stability Pacts death means that a new fiscal framework is needed
This means that new convergence criteria are needed too
For the inflation and interest rate criteria one possibility is to require the same margins as now but over the average for the entire eurozone
However the possibility that rapid growth might generate higher inflation in fastgrowing accession countries suggests that a slight increase in the permitted inflation margin  to say  percentage points  should be allowed
On the exchange rate a narrow fluctuation band should be avoided
I suggest creating an ERM light
As at present there would be a central rate with a fluctuation band of  on either side to guide market expectations
However intervention would not be required at these margins
If the margins were exceeded members would consider realignment 
The exchange rate criterion could be assessed later on the basis of a narrower band as the European Commission proposes although a limit of  fluctuation on either side of the central parity seems more reasonable than 
Intervention inside the narrow band would be discouraged banned so that rather than trying to force the foreign exchange market to fit the policies of a candidate country we would be listening to what markets say about the best rate for conversion to the euro 
The result might be a longer stay within the new ERM but without the crises that the original eurozone members suffered
It would certainly be better than joining the euro at a disastrously overvalued rate as Germany did
The hardest challenge is redefining the fiscal criterion but one thing is clear it would be absurd if candidates had to pass a test that was never applied after entry
If fiscal rules are unnecessary then a fiscal convergence criterion is also unnecessary
Of course most economists believe that fiscal rules 
 are
 needed to prevent some countries from free riding on low interest rates and running up debt to what would otherwise be unsustainable levels
But equality requires that any new accession criterion must be based on the fiscal rules that actually operate within the eurozone
The Ghosts of Economics Past
In Charles Dickens great novel A Christmas Carol the soulless businessman Ebeneezer Scrooge is tormented by a visit from the Spirit of Christmas Past
Today economists are similarly troubled by unwanted ghosts as they ponder the reappearance of economic ills long thought buried and dead
From Stephen Roach at Morgan Stanley to Paul Krugman at Princeton to the Governors of the US Federal Reserve and the senior staff at the European Central Bank to almost everyone in Japan economists all over the world are worrying about deflation
Their thoughts retrace the economic thinking of over fifty years ago a time when economists concluded that the thing to do with deflation was to avoid it like the plague
Back in  Irving Fisher Milton Friedmans predecessor atop Americas monetarist school of economists announced that governments could prevent deep depressions by avoiding deflation
Deflation a steady ongoing decline in prices gave businesses and consumers powerful incentives to cut spending and hoard cash
It reduced the ability of businesses and banks to service their debt and might trigger a chain of big bankruptcies that would destroy confidence in the financial system providing further incentives to hoard
Such strong incentives to hoard rather than spend can keep demand low and falling and unemployment high and rising for a much longer time than even the most laissezfaireoriented politician or economist had ever dared contemplate
Hence the Keynesian solution use monetary policy lower interest rates and fiscal policy expanded government spending and reduced taxes to keep the economy from ever approaching the precipice where deflation becomes possible
But if this is an issue solved over fifty years ago why is it haunting us now
Why is this menace a matter of grave concern in Japan today and a threat worth worrying about in the US
In the late s those present at the creation of the postWorld War II international economic order tried to create an international monetary system that would a allow for exchange rates stable enough for producers and consumers to escape the risks of excessive and irrational exchange rate fluctuations b allow countries to follow their own domestic macroeconomic policies and c prevent the catastrophic panics affecting not just individual banks but whole countries that produced the destructive international financial crisis of the Great Depression
The result was the fixedbutadjustable exchange rate system of Bretton Woods which over time mutated into the floatingrate system of the s
Then came the s
All of a sudden tremendously destructive herddriven financial crises were back Mexico Thailand Korea Brazil and so on looked like nothing as much as the US financial panic of  or the Austrian Creditanstalt crisis of 
Argentinas crisis at the end of  looked remarkably like Argentinas Baring Brothers crisis of   save that politicians and international bankers seem to have had a much better idea of what to do to minimize the damage in  than they do today
But if those who built the postWorld War II international monetary system worked to guard against the dangers posed by panicdriven international financial crises why are these financial devils back
The truth is that economic policymakers are juggling sets of potential disasters exchanging the one that appears most threatening for a threat that seems more distant
In the US the Bush Administration is skeptical of the stimulative power of monetary policy and wants bigger fiscal deficits to reduce unemployment hoping that the future dangers posed by persistent deficits  low investment slow growth loss of confidence uncontrolled inflation and exchange rate depreciation can be finessed or will not become visible until after the Bush team leaves office
In Europe the European Central Bank believes that the danger of uncontrolled inflation following a loss of public confidence in its commitment to low inflation outweighs the costs of European employment that is far too high
In developing countries capital controls to prevent financial crises are feared as obstacles to attracting the finance necessary for industrialization and as potential sources of corruption as financial flows somehow pass through the hands of the Vice Minister of Finances nephewinlaw
Flexible exchange rates designed to allow the market to signal when confidence in the currency is declining also put exporters at a competitive disadvantage against foreigncountry producers whose prices arent batted around by unpredictable exchange rates
Even the importsubstitution policies now universally scorned were originally adopted by the developing world for good as well as bad reasons the protectionist shuttingoff of developedcountry markets during the Great Depression which had disastrous consequences for the developing economies
The ghosts of economics past return because the lessons of the present are always oversold
Politicians and policymakers advance their approach to economics as the One True Doctrine
But what they are doing however is dealing with the biggest problem of the moment but at the price of removing institutions and policies that policymakers before them had put into place to control problems which they felt to be the most pressing
Ebeneezer Scrooges nocturnal visitors were able to convince him of the errors of his ways
Lets hope that todays economists also learn the lessons of their unwanted ghosts
The Ghosts of History in East Asia
This year marks the centenary of the RussoJapanese War of  and on August  many countries will commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the end of WWII in the Pacific
Of course Japan military dominance in East Asia  which began with the RussoJapanese War and led to WWII  is no more
The ghosts of this history still hang over in East Asia with each country struggling to find ways to deal with the past
China is a benchmark
Over the centuries Japan and China have taken turns dominating East Asia and both now seek to assert regional hegemony
Historically the Korean Peninsula was the playground for this rivalry but with North and South Korea appearing to make peace with each other South Korea is also staking a claim to regional influence
Resentment over past wrongs buttresses all of these rival claims for influence
During his visit to the US in June South Korean President Roh Moo Hyun told President Bush that China had invaded Korea over  times in history
His remarks shocked China which views itself as the victim of invasions most humiliatingly by the Japanese and has forgotten its own history of bullying its neighbors
Roh also openly criticizes Japan for its cowardice in not facing up to its historic war crimes saying that it does not deserve a seat on the UN Security Council
Japan long colonized Korea and during WWII Koreans were forced to join the Japanese Imperial Army  a situation similar to that of Taiwan
But whereas the struggle between China and Japan for dominance over Korea was the focal point of the East Asian drama Taiwan was but a sideshow a mere outpost to the Imperial Qing Dynasty while Korea was a vassal paying tribute to China
After defeating both the Qing dynasty and Russia Japan not only gained control over the Korean Peninsula but also extended its reach deep into Northeast China
As East Asia ig Brother Japan Kwantung Army founded Manchukuo in Northeast China in 
Japan wanted Manchukuo to become what India was to Britain or what Algeria was to France  a crown jewel of the empire  and sent a million immigrants  of whom died there after postwar Manchukuo was taken over by Russia while investing huge sums to develop heavy industry
Japan Nanjing government in China under Wang Jingwei was like Germany Vichy government in France under Henri Philippe Ptain
Both men were treated as traitors after the war ended
By contrast as a result of long colonization Taiwan and Korea had developed a complex of both resistance and reliance towards their rulers
With only a few exceptions the local elite was assimilated into the colonial system
But the outcome was similar throughout the region following Japan defeat in WWII
Civil war broke out in China the Korean Peninsula was divided and the other Southeast Asian colonies with the sole exception of Thailand resorted to military force to achieve independence
China has still failed to face up to the history of Manchukuo and its civil war not to mention opening the secret files concerning Mao Zedong decision to send almost a million soldiers into the Korean War
South Korea initiated talks with the Japanese government only recently on retrieving the remains of Korean slave workers
More than  Taiwanese and about the same amount of Korean soldiers who died for the Imperial Japan are worshipped in Japan Yasukuni shrine
And Recently some civil groups in both countries started to demand the return of the remains of their countries soldiers interred at Yasukuni
Taiwan delayed reawakening reflects the early reliance of its nationalist government on protection from the US and assistance from Japan
Chiang Kaishek had no choice but to return good for evil by abjuring compensation claims on Japan as well as by secretly arranging for the Kwantung Army exChief of Staff to join Taiwan efforts in confronting the Communists
Japan has never apologized for its colonization of Taiwan and Taiwanese had no opportunity for historical reflection during  years of martial law
This spring antiJapanese demonstrations broke out almost simultaneously in both China and Korea with both countries seeking to place the memory of Japanese dominance in the service of building a new national identity and strategic position
So we can expect that like the events in May to mark  years since the end of WWII in Europe Asia commemoration on August  of the end of the war in the Pacific will expose lingering  and still raw  historical sensitivities
Unlike in Europe however historical memory in Asia continues to be wedded to current strategic ambitions
One hundred years ago the rise of Japanese military power changed the fate of Asia
Sixty years ago the demise of Japanese power changed Asia fate again
Today as China rises in wealth and power to rival Japan Asia holds its breath waiting for the ghosts of history to disappear
The Ghosts of Summits Past
PRINCETON  The world is confronted by a dramatic financial crisis that many policymakers believe is more severe than the interwar Great Depression
Before  experts said that a new Great Depression was impossible because of the strength and the depth of the cooperative mechanisms set up at the end of World War II
The G summit has thus created enormous expectations that internationalism may once again overcome a plethora of economic problems
Unfortunately the magnitude of the expectations alone suggests that disappointment is almost certain
The symbolism of the location is unfortunate as it carries a reminiscence of the main abortive attempt to manage the world economy during the Great Depression
The  World Economic Conference also met in London at the Geological Museum with an even broader range of participants from  countries
The participants at the  summit may not visit the Geological Museum but they will have to deal with the specter of conferences past for the failure in  offers important lessons for our current leaders
First as with the G summit everyone expected the London Conference to fail
The plenary meeting was paralyzed by the way in which the preparatory commissions had worked
Monetary experts argued that an agreement on currency stabilization would be highly desirable but that it required a prior agreement on the dismantling of trade barriers  all the high tariffs and quotas that had been introduced in the course of the depression
Trade experts met in parallel and made the mirror image of this argument
They agreed that protectionism was obviously a vice but thought that it was a necessary one that could not be addressed without monetary stability
Only leadership by a determined great power prepared to sacrifice its particular national interests in order to break the resulting impasse might conceivably have saved the meeting
But such leadership was as unlikely then as it is now
Indeed the second lesson of the London Conference of  consists in governments unwillingness in times of great economic difficulty to make sacrifices that might entail a shortterm cost
Even if the result would have been longerterm stability the immediate political consequences were too unpleasant
In adverse economic circumstances governments felt vulnerable and unsure and they could not afford to alienate public support
Finally faced by a realization of inevitable failure participants look for a scapegoat
The  Conference looked like a classic detective novel in which every party had a reason to be a suspect
Britain and France had turned away from internationalism adopting trade systems known as mperial Preference which favored their vast overseas empires
Germany president had just appointed Adolf Hitler radical and aggressive government
The German delegation was led by Alfred Hugenberg who was not a Nazi but wanted to show that he was an even more implacable nationalist than Hitler himself
The Japanese government had just sent troops into Manchuria
Of all the major powers in London the United States looked the most reasonable and internationalist by far
It had a new charismatic president who was known as an Anglophile and a cosmopolitan spirit
Franklin Roosevelt was already taking vigorous action against the depression and was trying to reorder the failed US banking system
Roosevelt did not know what line to take at the conference and his stream of advisers offered inconsistent counsel
At last he lost patience and announced that for the moment the US had no intention of stabilizing the dollar
This message delivered on July   was known as he bombshell
Roosevelt talked about the need to restore he sound internal economic system of a nation and condemned the ld fetishes of socalled international bankers
Everyone pretended to be shocked at the failure of internationalism
But at the same time they were delighted to have found someone who could be blamed for the failure of the conference
In  we face a similar set of circumstances
The lines of conflict have been clearly drawn in advance
The US wants the world to embark on macroeconomic stimulus programs and thinks that the complicated task of reinventing and reordering financial supervision and regulation can wait
Many European countries cannot afford a stimulus package owing to overstretched public finances and instead want to make progress on the international regulation of banking
The alibis for failure are also already prepared
The new summit is unlikely to produce either a coordinated stimulus package or a detailed blueprint for a foolproof system of financial regulation
Throughout the meeting participants will be waiting for the moment when one of the leaders maybe Angela Merkel loses patience and makes the obvious and true remark that the process is a waste of effort
Then everyone will denounce this honest politician for having wrecked internationalism
In the  it was the autocratic and belligerent governments of Germany and Japan that could derive the most capital from the failure of the London conference
Failure at today London conference is also likely to be used as a rhetorical weapon against the large Western governments and to provide a rationale for implementing new forms of state capitalism
The Global Cost of Turkey Crisis
Turkey will hold its parliamentary election in July four months earlier than scheduled thereby narrowly avoiding a constitutional crisis over the choice of the country next president
Nonetheless Turkey bout with political instability has damaged its foreign policy and international standing
At the center of the storm are Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan head of the moderately Islamist Justice and Development Party AKP and Yasar Buyukanit Chief of the General Staff of the Turkish military which regards itself as the guardian of the secular republican tradition established by Kemal Ataturk
When Erdogan contemplated moving from the prime minister job to the presidency earlier this spring the military and secular political parties indicated profound dissatisfaction
General Buyukanit said in April that the country new president must be secular ot just in words but in essence
Having met and conversed with Erdogan on more than one occasion I found him a moderate and reasonable man
Moreover the AKP has broad support among Turkish voters and an admirable record of economic growth human rights legislation and improvement in the treatment of Turkey Kurdish minority
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul a close associate of Erdogan in the AKP pressed Turkey application to join the European Union
So when Erdogan decided to nominate Gul as the AKP candidate for the presidency I was surprised by the strength of the secularist opposition
The secular establishment argues that the AKP moderation thus far reflects the checks and balances implied by secularist control of the presidency
They argue that if the AKP comes to control the presidency it may no longer pursue moderate policies
Secularists point with concern to other AKP such as Speaker of the Parliament Bulent Arinc who are noted for their pronounced religious and social conservatism
When the Turkish Parliament attempted to elect the president on April  Gul did not receive enough votes to win on the first ballot
The main opposition party argued that the vote was invalid and the General Staff issued a statement that it was atching this situation with concern
Massive public demonstrations were held in Istanbul to support Turkey Kemalist secular tradition
The issue went to Turkey highest court which annulled the parliamentary vote effectively blocking Gul candidacy resulting in Erdogan decision to call an early election
These events were closely watched in Washington and Brussels
The United States had been pressing the EU to advance Turkey application for admission but Turkish membership was already controversial in several EU countries
This reflects concerns about Turkey Muslim culture and its large population as well as concern that any further enlargement will overly dilute the European project
Now opponents of Turkey EU accession bid have seized upon recent events to argue that the country does not meet the democratic standards necessary for full membership
They point out that Turkey military has ousted four elected governments since  and continues to play an inappropriately large role in Turkish politics
While the high court decision and the appeal to the electorate means that Turkish democracy has dodged a bullet for now the progress of Turkey EU accession negotiations has been further slowed
This is unfortunate for both Turkey and Europe
With a slowdown in accession negotiations Turkish politicians will have less incentive to continue the reforms necessary for membership
Turkey suffers from nationalist sensitivity and extremist groups have orchestrated several unfortunate incidents including attacks on minorities and harassment of cultural figures like the Nobel Prizewinning novelist Orhan Pamuk
If Turkey pulls away from Europe the EU claim that it successfully wields oft power in world politics will be powerfully undermined
In the larger picture Turkey is not only an important member of NATO with influence both in the Balkans and the Middle East but it also plays a vital role in the wider world
One of the crucial questions of twentyfirst century politics will be how the world copes with the rise of political Islam
For radical Islamists and some Westerners the rise of Islam sets the scene for a lash of civilizations which they welcome as a polarizing device that will allow them to recruit from the much larger Muslim mainstream
But Turkey has the potential to show the shallowness of such a scenario by demonstrating the compatibility of liberal democracy and Islam
Unfortunately this appears to have been lost on the neoconservatives in the Bush administration for whom it was the invasion of Iraq and its liberation from Saddam Hussein that was supposed to provide a beacon for a wave of democratization that would transform the Middle East
What they produced instead was an lectocracy that in the absence of liberal institutions replaced the tyranny of the Sunni minority with a tyranny of the Shiite majority and a religious sectarian civil war
Indeed the invasion of Iraq also hurt Turkey both economically and by strengthening the base for the Kurdish terrorist PKK organization operating from northern Iraq
The result has been a dramatic increase in antiAmericanism in Turkish politics
If the neo conservatives had instead focused their attentions on strengthening the soft power of Turkey they could have done far more to advance the cause of democracy in the Middle East
Nuclear Power Renaissance in Reverse
PARIS  Last June Yukiya Amano the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA declared that uclear power will make a significant and growing contribution to sustainable development in the coming decades
But as this year World Nuclear Industry Status Report highlights recent trends paint a very different picture
Duke Energy America largest utility has shelved plans to build two reactors in Florida after having spent  billion on the project
The decision came only three months after the company abandoned investment in two new units in North Carolina
In fact this year four American utilities have decided to shut down a total of five reactors permanently  the first closures in the United States in  years
One of the units  Kewaunee Power Station in Wisconsin  was abandoned after massive investment in upgrades and a year license renewal it simply could not generate power at competitive prices
For the same reasons Vermont Yankee another plant with a license to operate through  is now scheduled to close in 
Similarly the world largest nuclear operator  the French statecontrolled utility lectricit de France  announced its impending withdrawal from nuclear power in the US after having sunk roughly  billion into aborted projects
And in order to help offset soaring operating costs which resulted in losses of  billion  billion last year EDF will raise electricity prices this year for its French customers by  on average and by another  next year
Over the five years ending in March  EDF lost  of its share value
Likewise the world largest nuclear builder  the French statecontrolled company AREVA  lost up to  of its share value between  and 
Not surprisingly investors have welcomed new strategic plans by both companies as well as EDF withdrawal from the US market the downward pressure on their share prices has eased though for how long remains to be seen
The nuclearenergy industry decline began decades ago
But since the March  triplemeltdown at Japan Fukushima Daiichi plant the pace of the decline has accelerated significantly
Indeed in  annual nuclear generation worldwide dropped by an unprecedented  exceeding the previous year recordbreaking drop of  and bringing total annual nuclearpower generation to  below its historic maximum achieved in 
Although Japan accounts for threequarters of this decline with only two of the  units that are officially in operation in Japan actually producing power  other countries including the world top five nuclear generators also decreased their output
As a result nuclear power share of global electricity generation dropped to around  in  compared to its  peak of 
Only the Czech Republic reached its historic maximum nuclear share last year
Moreover of the  reactors under construction worldwide twothirds are located in just three countries  China India and Russia  with China alone accounting for 
Nine of the  have been listed as nder construction for more than two decades
The Watts Bar  reactor in Tennessee holds the record having been under construction for  years
An additional four projects have been underway for more than ten years
In total at least  of the  units currently under construction have encountered delays many of which have lasted for several years
Whether the other projects all of which have been initiated in the past five years are on schedule remains to be seen
As a result of such delays only three new units began operating last year  half the number of reactors that were shut down
The average age of the world reactor fleet now stands at  years and continues to increase steadily
By contrast new renewable technologies are gaining traction illustrating a fundamental shift in international energy policy and investment strategies
Last year China Germany Japan and India generated more power from renewables than from nuclear for the first time
In China and India wind alone outpaced nuclear
Since  global onshore windpower generation has averaged  annual growth while the growth rate for solar photovoltaics has been a staggering 
Last year an additional  GW of wind and  GW of solar were installed worldwide compared to a net addition of  GW of nuclear
The shift to renewables has been particularly pronounced in the world major advanced economies
For example Germany ongoing nuclear phaseout has been complemented by accelerated renewables implementation with up to  MW of solar photovoltaic capacity connected to Germany power grid in a single month
As a result the price per installed solar kilowatt has dropped by threequarters over the last seven years
Even in the US where cheap shale gas is reshaping the energy industry more wind power was connected to the grid last year than gas and in the first three months of this year more than  of new capacity was renewable
Over the past decade the nuclear industry has attempted to capture global leaders attention with a promotional campaign centered around the notion of a uclear renaissance
But their promises  including investment costs of  per installed kilowatt and building times of four years  have proved to be false
Indeed since the industry launched its publicrelations campaign in the early  cost estimates have increased roughly sevenfold and profits have declined
The  reactors that started up over the last decade had a mean construction time of nearly ten years but contributed just  GW  onethird of what solar and wind added in one year
The IAEA optimistic rhetoric cannot obscure fundamental arithmetic skyrocketing maintenance expenses and in many cases postFukushima upgrade costs together with the impossibility of building competitive new capacity without massive government subsidies are devastating the nuclear industry
As the economist Mark Cooper has put it nuclear power is actually undergoing a enaissance in reverse
The Global Economics of Desire
How concerned should advanced countries be about the outsourcing of manufacturing to China or software development to India
Fear of jobs lost to lowwage countries strikes a populist chord but misses a vital point the prosperity of developed countries depends primarily on entrepreneurship
After all no economy can raise living standards forever through innovations that make production of existing goods more efficient
In the short run increased efficiency reduces the cost of a good or service so people consume more of it
But eventually consumers refuse to buy more even if prices continue to fall
After that further efficiencies require shedding workers
Creating and satisfying new consumer desires keeps the system going by absorbing the labor and purchasing power released by the increasingly efficient satisfaction of old ones
At the other end of this process producers who satisfy old desires continue economizing because they compete for employees and consumers with producers who satisfy new desires
Similarly outsourcing to lowwage countries improves living standards only if the human capital released can be used to make new goods and services
Otherwise outsourcing merely reduces demand for domestic labor just like other efficiency gains
For many advanced countries expansion of markets for new goods and services facilitates  and has been facilitated by  imports from lowwage countries
More than half of all manufactured goods consumed in the US are made abroad particularly low technology massproduced laborintensive products
Virtually all the toys and shoes sold in the US are made in the Far East
China alone accounts for  of the US bicycle market
Resources released by these imports fostered the growth of industries that satisfy new needs
Cheap Asian televisions gave Western households the wherewithal to purchase PCs powered by Intel microprocessors and Microsoft software which are designed by engineering graduates who would otherwise have worked for TV manufacturers
To be sure the speed and magnitude of the integration of nearly a billion Chinese and Indian workers into global labor markets is unprecedented and will hurt some workers and communities in developed countries
But as long as these economies churn out new desires outsourcing represents an opportunity for prosperity on both sides
The problem of course is that producers of new goods and services do not create jobs at exactly the same rate as efficiency gains or imports reduce the demand for labor
Following the Internet boom of the late s job creation slowed while efficiency improvements continued to reduce the labor required by the old goods and services
Nor does the usual argument for free trade apply
Lowcost call centers in India or Chinese made bicycles do not reflect any natural comparative advantage
Rather costs are low because for almost two centuries colonial powers and then domestic governments hobbled markets and restricted international trade leaving a legacy of wages so low that they offset weaker productivity
Moreover exports to lowwage countries cannot compensate for job losses
A Chinese worker simply cannot buy the same goods and services as a worker in the EU and workers in lowwage countries spend only a small portion of their incomes on EU products
As incomes in China grow imports from other low or middleincome countries rise faster than imports from highwage countries
Chinas trade surplus with the US exceeds  billion but it runs a deficit with India
Uncertainty about jobs breeds anxiety and anxiety stokes protectionist sentiments
But apart from a few industries such as toys and bicycles far fewer jobs are lost to imports than to efficiency improvements
Manufacturing employment in the US fell in  to its lowest level since  but thanks to a tripling in output per worker total manufacturing output was roughly three times larger
Pressure to reduce costs in the recent downturn may have accelerated the movement of jobs to lowwage locations but this accounts for only  of the decline in employment since the downturn began
The Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter attributed the boomandbust cycles of the th century to periodic bursts of creative destruction followed by lulls in innovative activity
More effective use of countercyclical policies may have subsequently smoothed out the economic cycle but this cannot explain why productivity and incomes also grew more rapidly than in the th century
Standard supplyside arguments fare no better
After all tax rates were higher in the th century and regulation more extensive
A critical factor is large scale nondestructive creation
Inventions from  to  may well overshadow those of the entire th century but they were the result of a few inventors such as Thomas Edison who satisfied a small wealthy clientele
In the th century many entrepreneurs large companies financiers and inventors developed products and services for the masses
Moreover their innovations created and satisfied many new consumer desires
Airplanes for instance didnt reduce demand for automobiles people fly when they would not otherwise have driven
These new mass markets sustained a steady increase in average incomes and total employment
Simply put the longterm prosperity of developed economies depends on their capacity to create and satisfy new consumer desires
Provided this capacity remains in good repair job losses  through improvements in the efficiency of domestic production or through outsourcing to lowwage countries  will enhance standards of living
But if this capacity is impaired neither the low road of protection nor the high road of free trade can do much good
The Global Economy Corporate Crime Wave
NEW YORK  The world is drowning in corporate fraud and the problems are probably greatest in rich countries  those with supposedly ood governance
Poorcountry governments probably accept more bribes and commit more offenses but it is rich countries that host the global companies that carry out the largest offenses
Money talks and it is corrupting politics and markets all over the world
Hardly a day passes without a new story of malfeasance
Every Wall Street firm has paid significant fines during the past decade for phony accounting insider trading securities fraud Ponzi schemes or outright embezzlement by CEOs
A massive insidertrading ring is currently on trial in New York and has implicated some leading financialindustry figures
And it follows a series of fines paid by America biggest investment banks to settle charges of various securities violations
There is however scant accountability
Two years after the biggest financial crisis in history which was fueled by unscrupulous behavior by the biggest banks on Wall Street not a single financial leader has faced jail
When companies are fined for malfeasance their shareholders not their CEOs and managers pay the price
The fines are always a tiny fraction of the illgotten gains implying to Wall Street that corrupt practices have a solid rate of return
Even today the banking lobby runs roughshod over regulators and politicians
Corruption pays in American politics as well
The current governor of Florida Rick Scott was CEO of a major healthcare company known as ColumbiaHCA
The company was charged with defrauding the United States government by overbilling for reimbursement and eventually pled guilty to  felonies paying a fine of  billion
The FBI investigation forced Scott out of his job
But a decade after the company guilty pleas Scott is back this time as a reemarket Republican politician
When Barack Obama wanted somebody to help with the bailout of the US automobile industry he turned to a Wall Street ixer Steven Rattner even though Obama knew that Rattner was under investigation for giving kickbacks to government officials
After Rattner finished his work at the White House he settled the case with a fine of a few million dollars
But why stop at governors or presidential advisers
Former Vice President Dick Cheney came to the White House after serving as CEO of Halliburton
During his tenure at Halliburton the firm engaged in illegal bribery of Nigerian officials to enable the company to win access to that country oil fields  access worth billions of dollars
When Nigeria government charged Halliburton with bribery the company settled the case out of court paying a fine of  million
Of course there were no consequences whatsoever for Cheney
The news barely made a ripple in the US media
Impunity is widespread nbspindeed most corporate crimes go unnoticed
The few that are noticed typically end with a slap on the wrist with the company  meaning its shareholders  picking up a modest fine
The real culprits at the top of these companies rarely need to worry
Even when firms pay megafines their CEOs remain
The shareholders are so dispersed and powerless that they exercise little control over the management
The explosion of corruption  in the US Europe China India Africa Brazil and beyond  raises a host of challenging questions about its causes and about how to control it now that it has reached epidemic proportions
Corporate corruption is out of control for two main reasons
First big companies are now multinational while governments remain national
Big companies are so financially powerful that governments are afraid to take them on
Second companies are the major funders of political campaigns in places like the US while politicians themselves are often part owners or at least the silent beneficiaries of corporate profits
Roughly onehalf of US Congressmen are millionaires and many have close ties to companies even before they arrive in Congress
As a result politicians often look the other way when corporate behavior crosses the line
Even if governments try to enforce the law companies have armies of lawyers to run circles around them
The result is a culture of impunity based on the wellproven expectation that corporate crime pays
Given the close connections of wealth and power with the law reining in corporate crime will be an enormous struggle
Fortunately the rapid and pervasive flow of information nowadays could act as a kind of deterrent or disinfectant
Corruption thrives in the dark yet more information than ever comes to light via email and blogs as well as Facebook Twitter and other social networks
We will also need a new kind of politician leading a new kind of political campaign one based on free online media rather than paid media
When politicians can emancipate themselves from corporate donations they will regain the ability to control corporate abuses
Moreover we will need to light the dark corners of international finance especially tax havens like the Cayman Islands and secretive Swiss banks
Tax evasion kickbacks illegal payments bribes and other illegal transactions flow through these accounts
The wealth power and illegality enabled by this hidden system are now so vast as to threaten the global economy legitimacy especially at a time of unprecedented income inequality and large budget deficits owing to governments inability politically  and sometimes even operationally  to impose taxes on the wealthy
So the next time you hear about a corruption scandal in Africa or other poor region ask where it started and who is doing the corrupting
Neither the US nor any other dvanced country should be pointing the finger at poor countries for it is often the most powerful global companies that have created the problem
The Global Economy Dialogue of the Deaf
CHICAGO  As governments do more to try to coax the world economy out of recession the danger of protectionism is becoming more real
It is emerging in ways that were unforeseen by those who founded our existing global institutions
Unfortunately the discussion between countries on trade nowadays is very much a dialogue of the deaf with countries spouting platitudes at one another but no enforceable and verifiable commitments agreed upon
There is an urgent need to reform global institutions  and more dramatically than envisaged by the G thus far
Protectionism is not just about raising tariffs on imports it is any government action that distorts the global production and allocation of goods services and capital to favor domestic producers thereby reducing overall efficiency
So for example government pressure on multinational banks to lend domestically or to withdraw liquidity from foreign branches is protectionism as are capital injections into multinational companies with the explicit requirement that domestic jobs be preserved
Such actions are problematic not only because they insulate inefficient forms of production but also because foreign countries respond by adopting similar measures towards their national champions so that everyone is worse off
The number of inefficient workers protected by these measures is offset by the number of efficient workers laid off by foreign multinationals responding to political pressures in their home country
Perhaps of greatest concern moreover is that the public especially in poor countries that cannot undertake offsetting measures will come to distrust global integration with multinationals viewed as Trojan horses
In addition to explicit protectionist measures governments now plan actions that will affect others across the globe
For example the large volume of public debt that industrial countries will issue will undoubtedly raise interest rates and affect developing country governments borrowing costs
There is little dialogue about how industrial country issuances can be staggered to minimize the impact on global markets and what alternatives can be developed for countries that are shut out
If developing countries are left to their own devices they will conclude that they should selfinsure by rebuilding foreignexchange reserves to even higher levels a strategy that has clearly hurt global growth
We need a moderatesized representative group of leaders of the world largest economies to meet regularly to discuss such issues informed by an impartial secretariat that will place its analyses before the group
Initially the group should only exert peer pressure on its members to comply with international responsibilities
But as confidence in the group decisionmaking  and in the impartiality of the secretariat  improves members might give it some teeth such as the ability to impose collective economic sanctions on recalcitrant members
The United Nations is too large to serve this purpose and the most obvious candidate for the group the G is not representative
There is however a representative alternative  the International Monetary and Financial Committee IMFC a group of finance ministers and central bank governors that meets twice a year to advise the International Monetary Fund
While the IMFC could be shrunk for example if eurozone countries agree to a common seat the real challenge is to make it a venue in which countries talk to one another rather than at one another
To meet this goal some changes would be in order
First the frequency of meetings should be increased especially in times of crisis and the level of a few of these meetings enhanced
So for example two meetings a year at the headofgovernment level and quarterly meetings at the financeminister level with more at the deputyminister level would provide ample time for dialogue and thus for trustbuilding and would allow the commitments made by the heads of government to be monitored
Second the IMF permanent Executive Board established in an era when travel was costly and communications difficult and consisting of midlevel government functionaries should be abolished
Important decisions should be vetted by the IMFC and others delegated to IMF management
Current executive directors typically do not have the authority to make commitments on their countries behalf so their effort is often diverted to minutiae
And in an attempt to preserve its turf the Board constantly attempts to keep the IMFC from discussing anything of substance
Third the obvious secretariat is the IMF
Unfortunately the Fund is not regarded as being impartial especially by countries that have been seared by its past conditionality
The IMF has however become far more neutral than it is given credit for  though it could take more steps to distance itself from its past
These include abolishing any region or country right to appoint IMF management allowing the Fund to borrow from markets so that it does not have to keep seeking key countries permission to expand eliminating any country official veto power over major decisions and having its agenda set by the IMFC rather than outside bodies
Industrial countries should be happy that developing countries would take greater responsibility for global economic outcomes rather than simply sulking about their lack of voice and representation
Developing countries in turn would gain greater voice but would also be forced to contribute ideas and resources to deal with global problems
And maybe just maybe we would preserve faith in globalization
The Global Economyus Gathering Storm
MUNICH  From  to  the world economy experienced an unusually long and strong boom with growth rates of nearly  and with many countries participating
The European Union EU recorded  growth on average during these years
In Germany where growth averaged  during this period some journalists proclaimed a new economic miracle
Now however increasingly bad news is giving rise to serious doubts dark clouds are hovering over the United States in particular
Is the world economy on the brink of recession
In the US realestate prices remain in free fall and the banking crisis is still claiming new victims Bear Stearns IndyMac First Heritage Bank First National Bank of Nevada First Priority Bank Fannie Mae Freddie Mac etc
In the banking world as a whole expected writeoffs now considerably exceed the  billion mark projected just last spring
Unemployment moreover is rising at its fastest rate in seven years
Overall employment which is still high in historical terms has been declining continuously since the beginning of 
It is surprising that America stock market hasn crashed yet since all other indicators are pointing downward
The Standard ampamp Poor priceearnings ratio recently stood at around  well above the longterm average of around  since 
Disturbing signals for the world economy have also come from recent surveys of economic activity
The Ifo World Economic Climate index deteriorated in the third quarter of  for the fourth consecutive time
That decline was primarily the result of more unfavorable appraisals of the current economic situation but also reflected another downward revision of expectations for the next six months
Today the index is at its lowest level since the fourth quarter of 
The cooling of the Ifo World Economic Climate index was particularly marked in Western Europe and Asia
This has dispelled hopes that Asia economic activity could develop separately from that of the US thereby offsetting European exporters losses in America
In the third quarter of  the Ifo index for Asia was at its lowest level since the attack on the World Trade Center in  with particularly poor economic assessments coming from Japan
In the US the climate indicator declined again after having sunk dramatically in the second quarter bringing it to its lowest level since 
The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index fell in June  to its lowest level in decades and has since recovered only insignificantly
Also for the euro area the Ifo Economic Climate index registered a dramatic decline
Europe largest economy Germany is now going into the doldrums
The Ifo Business Climate index which though based on a survey for Germany is regarded as Europe most important economic activity indicator has been falling with few interruptions since the autumn of last year
It is now clearly in territory that implies an economic downturn
In addition export expectations for German manufacturing are heading south
Incoming orders in manufacturing the most important indicator in the official statistics fell more sharply in the first two quarters of  than at any time since the beginning of 
In the second quarter the German economy shrank at an annualized seasonally and calendar adjusted rate of 
All in all there is now hardly any doubt that the economic upturn in Germany that began in the summer of  is now coming to an end
Amid this gloomy outlook we anxiously look for encouraging signs
The price of crude oil which hit a record level of  a barrel in July has since fallen almost  or 
Whether recent developments in America economy give reason for hope is now the question
With an annualized  quarterly rise in GDP in AprilJune growth was twice as high as in the first quarter 
This largely reflects the impact of  billion in tax rebates roughly  of GDP but given the continuing and intensifying realestate crisis this boost to growth still does not mark a turnaround
In Japan with an economy of about half the size of the US growth forces remain weak In the second quarter of  the Japanese economy shrank at an annualized rate of  primarily due to weak exports
With all this discouraging news it is little comfort that some areas of the world are still displaying considerable growth rates China is expected to grow by  this year and in  with India growing by  Russia up by  owing to higher oil prices and Latin America growing by  on average during this period
Unfortunately the weight of these countries and regions is small China the biggest of them accounts for only  of the world economy
So the signs of a worldwide economic slowdown have increased
The American crisis is now spreading to other areas of the world
Former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan may be right when he says his crisis is different  a once or twice a century event deeply rooted in fears of insolvency of major financial institutions
The Global Economy Inevitable Hard Landing
In recent weeks the global liquidity and credit crunch that started last August has become more severe
This is easy to show in the United States the euro zone and the United Kingdom spreads between Libor interest rates at which banks lend to each other and central bank interest rates  as well as government bonds  are extremely high and have grown since the crisis began
This signals risk aversion and mistrust of counterparties
To be sure major central banks have injected dozens of billions of dollars of liquidity into the commercial banking sector and the US Federal Reserve the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada have lowered their interest rates
But worsening financial conditions prove that this policy response has failed miserably
So it is no surprise that central banks have become increasingly desperate in the face of the most severe crisis since the advent of financial globalization
The recent announcement of coordinated liquidity injections by the Fed and four other major central banks is to be blunt too little too late
These measures will fail to reduce interbank spreads significantly because monetary policy cannot address the core problems underlying the crisis
The issue is not just illiquidity  financial institutions with shortterm liabilities and longerterm illiquid assets
Many more economic agents face serious credit and solvency problems including millions of households in the US UK and the Eurozone with excessive mortgages hundreds of bankrupt subprime mortgage lenders a growing number of distressed homebuilders many highly leveraged and distressed financial institutions and increasingly corporatesector firms
At the same time monetary injections cannot resolve the generalized uncertainty of a financial system in which globalization and securitization have led to a lack of transparency that has undermined trust and confidence
When you mistrust your financial counterparties you won want to lend to them no matter how much money you have
The US is now headed towards recession regardless of what the Fed does
The buildup of real and financial problems  the worst US housing recession ever oil at  a barrel or above a severe credit crunch falling investment by the corporate sector and savingsless and debtburdened consumers buffeted by multiple negative shocks  make a recession unavoidable
Other economies will also be pulled down as the US contagion spreads
To mitigate the effects of a US recession and global economic slump the Fed and other central banks should be cutting rates much more aggressively rather than relying on modest liquidity injections that are bound to fail
The Fed basispoint cut in December was puny relative to what is needed similar cuts by the Bank of England and Bank of Canada do not even begin to address the increase in nominal and real borrowing rates that the sharp rise in Libor rates has induced
Central banks should have announced a coordinated  basispoint reduction to signal their seriousness about avoiding a global hard landing
Likewise the European Central Bank decision not to cut rates  deluding itself that it may be able to raise them once the allegedly emporary credit crunch is gone  is mistaken
With deflating housing bubbles high oil prices and a strong euro already impeding growth the ECB is virtually ensuring a sharp eurozone slowdown
In any case the actions recently announced by the Fed and other central banks are misdirected
Today financial markets are dominated by nonbank institutions  investment banks money market funds hedge funds mortgage lenders that do not accept deposits socalled tructured investment vehicles and even states and local government investment funds  that have no direct or indirect access to the liquidity support of central banks
All these nonbank institutions are now potentially at risk of a liquidity run
Indeed US legislation strictly forbids the Fed from lending to nondepository institutions except in emergencies
But this implies a complex and cumbersome approval process and the provision of highquality collateral
And never in its history has the Fed lent to nondepository institutions
So the risk of something equivalent to a bank run for nonbank financial institutions owing to their shortterm liabilities and longerterm and illiquid assets is rising  as recent runs on some banks Northern Rock money market funds state investment funds distressed hedge funds suggests
There is little chance that banks will relend to these nonbanks the funds they borrowed from central banks given these banks own severe liquidity problems and mistrust of nonbank counterparties
Major policy regulatory and supervisory reforms will be required to clean up the current mess and create a sounder global financial system
Monetary policy alone cannot resolve the consequences of inaction by regulators and supervisors amid the credit excesses of the last few years
So a US hard landing and global slowdown is unavoidable
Much greater and more rapid reduction of official interest rates may at best affect how long and protracted the downturn will be
National Drift or Global Mastery
LONDON  As world business leaders gather in Davos a longoverdue paradigm shift in monetary policy  subordinating the targeting of inflation to the targeting of growth  is slowly taking shape
In what some call a everse Volcker moment US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has specified a target of  unemployment alongside his inflation target Japan new government has proposed a minimum inflation target and Mark Carney the next governor of the Bank of England has argued that here could not be a more favorable case for nominal GDP targeting
Meanwhile China has pledged to double average domestic per capita income by 
Sadly it has taken four years of gross underestimation of the impact of fiscal austerity and a chronic shortage of demand with the economy supply potential beginning to decline accordingly for us to agree to target growth  which the G called for in 
So why with change materializing is there so little optimism about growth as we enter  and why is there so much talk of a ost decade
The answer is that the problem of low growth requires more than a shift in national monetary policies it also requires an agreement to coordinate global growth  a solution that has not been forthcoming
Of course some of the pessimism arises from the weakness of Europe which has agreed only that the European Central Bank be lender of last resort and some stems from recognition of the limits of quantitative easing
In part we are victims of a selffulfilling pessimism  the view that a debt overhang dooms us to unemployment and stagnation with nothing to be gained by attempting to use fiscal expansion or monetary innovation to counter it
But I believe that we have failed to grow faster for a more fundamental reason
Put simply ten years ago America could deliver a global recovery
Perhaps ten years from now Asian consumer spending will fill this void
But today for the first time in decades no single economy can drive the global economy forward
For  years until  the West America and Europe was responsible for the majority of global output manufacturing trade investment and consumption
Now we are in a transitional era with the rest of the world outproducing outmanufacturing outtrading and outinvesting Europe and America  but not yet outconsuming them
This imbalance means that producers of most goods and services are outside the West but rely on Western consumers to absorb their output
Until the transition is complete we depend on each other no one can succeed alone
But in the absence of global coordination the world is stuck in a rut acting out its own global version of the risoner dilemma  a universe in which no major economy can succeed on its own yet none trusts any other enough to attempt cooperation and coordination
NominalGDP targets may be a necessary way forward but they are not a sufficient response to slow global growth
Even the boldest of national initiatives may fail  not because targeting economic growth is the wrong approach but because there is no way to sustain the higher levels of growth that we need without better global coordination
In the absence of a favorable global context any change in economic policy that is purely national like employment targeting will have limited benefits and may discredit the pursuit of a national employment goal
So today fundamental policy void  yet to be addressed  lies in national governments unwillingness to contemplate global leadership
Cynics might argue that this is dysfunctional national decisionmaking replicated at a global level
But there is a more compelling explanation nobody will confront pervasive protectionism
Of course economic nationalism is obvious in America with its nervousness about China and hostility to global agreements but Europe too is now witnessing both a wave of antiimmigrant sentiment and rising resistance to helping poorer countries
Indeed it is safer for politicians to offer the opposite of a global vision to renationalize every economic problem and attribute all of them to the mistakes of domestic opponents
So for four years budget deficits  which do of course have to be addressed by longterm debtreduction plans  have virtually monopolized economicpolicy debate in Europe and America at the expense of sensible discussions about growth employment and trade
Put crudely it is more beneficial politically for an opposition politician to claim that his country problems are selfinduced caused by domestic profligacy and have little to do with global financial failures
Citizens would be excused for concluding that the  global financial crisis had nothing to do with a global banking collapse and was entirely caused by a few spendthrift national governments racking up deficits
As a result millions of people are unemployed unnecessarily and millions more face reductions in their living standards
Economics is now global but politics remains local
Global challenges grow while the agendas of international summits contract reinforcing the myth that they are mere talking shops
But even as protectionist sentiment frustrates cooperation there is a global growth deal waiting to be done
It starts from the recognition that large surplus savings and much unused capacity are waiting to be mobilized and that expanding consumer demand among Asia rising middle class holds the key to expansion
Yet China whose consumers are perfectly able to absorb imports from the West will remain wary of boosting middleclass demand while it is in fear of losing some of its Western export markets
India government wants to open up its economy to Western imports but the rest of the world is not addressing its fears of overexposure to global volatility
Only a coordinated policy response covering all of the G economies can break this vicious cycle of low confidence and slow trade growth
If China could be confident that its export markets will not falter it could expand domestic consumer demand and take in Western goods
Likewise if America were confident that it could sell in Asia Western consumer confidence would rise
Three years ago the International Monetary Fund showed that by coordinating the expansion of Asian demand and investment in Western infrastructure we could mobilize private funds for big privatepublic partnership projects
Global output would rise  employment would grow by  million and  million people would escape poverty
Global economic coordination is no longer a luxury
Winston Churchill gibe about the policies of the  haunts us as well
Governments Churchill said then were esolved to be irresolute adamant for drift solid for fluidity and allpowerful for impotence
In  it is irresolution drift and the resulting impotence that we too must address
The Economic Fundamentals of 
NEW YORK  The global economy this year will exhibit some similarities with the conditions that prevailed in 
No surprise there we face another year in which global growth will average about  but with a multispeed recovery  a subpar belowtrend annual rate of  in the advanced economies and closetotrend rates of  in emerging markets
But there will be some important differences as well
Painful deleveraging  less spending and more saving to reduce debt and leverage  remains ongoing in most advanced economies which implies slow economic growth
But fiscal austerity will envelop most advanced economies this year rather than just the eurozone periphery and the United Kingdom
Indeed austerity is spreading to the core of the eurozone the United States and other advanced economies with the exception of Japan
Given synchronized fiscal retrenchment in most advanced economies another year of mediocre growth could give way to outright contraction in some countries
With growth anemic in most advanced economies the rally in risky assets that began in the second half of  has not been driven by improved fundamentals but rather by fresh rounds of unconventional monetary policy
Most major advanced economies central banks  the European Central Bank the US Federal Reserve the Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank  have engaged in some form of quantitative easing and they are now likely to be joined by the Bank of Japan which is being pushed toward more unconventional policies by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe new government
Moreover several risks lie ahead
First America minideal on taxes has not steered it fully away from the fiscal cliff
Sooner or later another ugly fight will take place on the debt ceiling the delayed sequester of spending and a congressional ontinuing spending resolution an agreement to allow the government to continue functioning in the absence of an appropriations law
Markets may become spooked by another fiscal cliffhanger
And even the current minideal implies a significant amount of drag  about  of GDP  on an economy that has grown at barely a  rate over the last few quarters
Second while the ECB actions have reduced tail risks in the eurozone  a Greek exit andor loss of market access for Italy and Spain  the monetary union fundamental problems have not been resolved
Together with political uncertainty they will reemerge with full force in the second half of the year
After all stagnation and outright recession  exacerbated by frontloaded fiscal austerity a strong euro and an ongoing credit crunch  remain Europe norm
As a result large  and potentially unsustainable  stocks of private and public debt remain
Moreover given aging populations and low productivity growth potential output is likely to be eroded in the absence of more aggressive structural reforms to boost competitiveness leaving the private sector no reason to finance chronic currentaccount deficits
Third China has had to rely on another round of monetary fiscal and credit stimulus to prop up an unbalanced and unsustainable growth model based on excessive exports and fixed investment high saving and low consumption
By the second half of the year the investment bust in real estate infrastructure and industrial capacity will accelerate
And because the country new leadership  which is conservative gradualist and consensusdriven  is unlikely to speed up implementation of reforms needed to increase household income and reduce precautionary saving consumption as a share of GDP will not rise fast enough to compensate
So the risk of a hard landing will rise by the end of this year
Fourth many emerging markets  including the BRICs Brazil Russia India and China but also many others  are now experiencing decelerating growth
Their tate capitalism  a large role for stateowned companies an even larger role for stateowned banks resource nationalism importsubstitution industrialization and financial protectionism and controls on foreign direct investment  is the heart of the problem
Whether they will embrace reforms aimed at boosting the private sector role in economic growth remains to be seen
Finally serious geopolitical risks loom large
The entire greater Middle East  from the Maghreb to Afghanistan and Pakistan  is socially economically and politically unstable
Indeed the Arab Spring is turning into an Arab Winter
While an outright military conflict between Israel and the US on one side and Iran on the other side remains unlikely it is clear that negotiations and sanctions will not induce Iran leaders to abandon efforts to develop nuclear weapons
With Israel refusing to accept a nucleararmed Iran and its patience wearing thin the drums of actual war will beat harder
The fear premium in oil markets may significantly rise and increase oil prices by  leading to negative growth effects in the US Europe Japan China India and all other advanced economies and emerging markets that are net oil importers
While the chance of a perfect storm  with all of these risks materializing in their most virulent form  is low any one of them alone would be enough to stall the global economy and tip it into recession
And while they may not all emerge in the most extreme way each is or will be appearing in some form
As  begins the downside risks to the global economy are gathering force
Global Marketsu Time Factor
BARCELONA  In recent months the dichotomy between booming financial markets on the one hand and sluggish economies and dysfunctional politics on the other has loomed large
Yet insufficient attention is being devoted to a critical factor  time and who controls it  that could well mean the difference between an orderly global resolution of today growing inconsistencies and a return to a more troubled phase
Markets have been understandably buoyant in the first quarter of 
Most economic data confirm that after the trauma caused by the global financial crisis the United States economy is healing and doing so in an accelerated fashion
The sequence is now well established
It started with large multinational companies which are on as solid a financial footing as I can remember
Smaller firms are gradually recuperating banks have rebuilt their capital cushions and reduced their dubious assets the housing sector has stabilized and a growing number of households are reestablishing healthier balance sheets especially as employment gradually picks up
This privatesector recovery is helping government finances
The US budget deficit has been on a downward trend for now helped by both higher revenues and lower pressure on spending for example payments to the unemployed have fallen as joblessness has declined
The healing process is also evident in Europe though unfortunately it is effectively limited only to sovereignbond markets
The real economy remains under enormous pressure in several countries as economies contract and unemployment remains alarmingly high
After flirting with disaster last July interestrate spreads for eurozone bonds have generally been subdued and financial segmentation has been slowly reversed that is at least before European officials embarked on the controversial path of trying to impose losses on guaranteed bank deposits in Cyprus
Moreover as Ireland highly successful  billion tenyear bond issue in midMarch demonstrated some countries are in the process of restoring normal access to capital markets
The impact on markets of these trends has been turbocharged by central banks which are risk markets best friends
This is not because they wish to play that role rather it is because higher asset prices are essential if central bankers stand any chance of delivering the desired economic outcomes of higher growth and stronger job creation
This is most evident in the US where markets love the Federal Reserve trifecta of nearzero policy interest rates negative in real terms aggressive forward policy guidance and asset purchases  all of which push investors to take more risk
Markets also welcome the fact that the Fed hyperactive experimentation is forcing other central banks around the world to pursue more expansionary policies
Indeed from the Bank of Japan dramatic policy Uturn to the Bank of Mexico surprise interestrate cuts the Fed approach is affecting central banks in a growing number of countries
Pushed further away from bestcase scenarios they are unable to ignore the global liquidity impact of the Fed policies yet they lack the right policy tools to address it
The mix of endogenous healing and strong centralbank tailwinds including from a hatever it takes European Central Bank has also helped markets shrug off troubling political uncertainties
Be it the US Congress paralyzing polarization or Italy protest vote against the established political order politicians are being given time to overcome their dysfunction thereby minimizing any immediate disruptive impact
Understandably investors have interpreted all of this as a green light to take more risk
And with the hype this month over eight successive records for the Dow Jones index and many other records around the world excitement induces more investors to enter riskier asset markets
The excitement is not anxietyfree however and rightly so
Investors worry about the longerterm consequences of political dysfunction another year of European economic contraction disastrously high unemployment unprecedented  and thus untested  central bank policies and increasing global tensions
And the recent bungling of the Cyprus rescue does not help No wonder some have called the recent market rally ne of the most unloved in history
This mix of excitement and anxiety is in fact a sign of the looming crossroads that faces investors
One road involving a relatively orderly handoff from policyassisted recovery to selfsustaining growth offers the possibility of even greater financial rewards as rapidly improving economic and political conditions validate current artificial pricing and drive it higher
The other road is a lot less attractive
With insufficient endogenous healing and no economic escape velocity the effectiveness of central banks policies wanes and political dysfunction increases leading to financial losses volatility spikes and huge riskmanagement challenges
Given current policy and political uncertainties  and the multiple equilibria that they entail  it is difficult to predict with a high degree of confidence which road eventually will be taken and when
Those who claim otherwise may well fail to appreciate fully the exceptional nature of the current situation
In these circumstances timing may not be everything but it may prove to be a key determinant of the probabilities
If the journey to the crossroads is accelerated by a large geopolitical shock originating in say the Middle East or North Korea andor a serious political breakdown in Europe for example a meltdown in Cyprus or prolonged political paralysis in Italy the probability of taking the adverse path rises to an uncomfortably high level
If however central banks can contain domestic and global inconsistencies long enough the combination of endogenous healing and eventual political progress would significantly improve the probability distribution
Have no doubt today markets rely heavily on the old adage that ime heals all wounds
The timekeepers are central banks
But their control of the clock is less than perfect and it will become increasingly ineffective if economic improvement faces additional political headwinds in the months ahead
The Global Future of Europe Crisis
WASHINGTON DC  It is now clear that the eurozone crisis will continue well into  despite early February recovery in stock markets
Negotiations between Greece and the banks over Greek sovereign debt may yet be concluded but sufficiently wide participation by banks in the deal remains very much in doubt
Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund has raised the issue of officialsector debt reduction possibly even by the European Central Bank sending the message that a aircut for private bondholders will not be enough to return Greece to financial sustainability
The IMF concerns are valid but the Fund idea is being resisted fiercely owing to fears of political contagion other debtdistressed eurozone countries might press for equal treatment
Moreover the promised increase in IMF resources that would allow it to build a stronger firewall against financial contagion has still not arrived
And all of the changes agreed upon for the European Stabilization Fund ESF and the European Stability Mechanism ESM have yet to be implemented
Of course some positive steps have been taken
The ECB generous provision of liquidity to European banks at only  interest for up to three years has prevented a banking crisis from piling on top of the sovereigndebt crisis
But that initiative has not succeeded in reducing the roblem countries longerterm borrowing costs to levels compatible with their projected growth rates there is just too much longterm uncertainty and growth prospects are simply too discouraging
Indeed in midJanuary Standard amp Poor downgraded AAArated France and Austria in addition to seven other eurozone countries  Slovenia Slovakia Spain Malta Italy Cyprus and Portugal
It now seems clear to almost everyone that one key challenge facing the eurozone stems from the fact that it is a monetary union without being an economic union an arrangement that has no counterpart anywhere
As a result divergences in production costs over time cannot be compensated by exchangerate adjustments
In the absence of somewhat higher inflation in the surplus countries say  a year adjustment requires deflation in the crisis countries to bring about a noticeable relative decline in production costs over time
In practice such deflation can be achieved only at the cost of high unemployment and social distress
It is therefore unclear whether the current strategy of combining austerity and deflation is politically feasible which explains the huge uncertainty hanging over the entire eurozone
Somewhat higher inflation in the surplus countries and larger crossborder resource transfers would give the deficit countries more time allowing for structural reforms to produce results and reducing the need for deflation
But Northern European surplus countries reject such an approach fearing that it would weaken the pressure on Southern European debtor countries to undertake structural reforms in the first place
Beyond the specific problems of the monetary union there is also a global dimension to Europe challenges  the tension emphasized by authors such as Dani Rodrik and Jean Michel Severino and Olivier Ray between national democratic politics and globalization
Trade communication and financial linkages have created a degree of interdependence among national economies which together with heightened vulnerability to financialmarket swings has restricted national policymakers freedom of action everywhere
Perhaps the most dramatic sign of this tension came when Greece thenprime minister George Papandreou announced a referendum on the policy package proposed to allow Greece to stay in the eurozone
While one can debate the merits of referenda for decisionmaking the heart of the problem was the very notion of holding a national debate for several weeks given that markets move in hours or minutes
It took less than  hours for Papandreou proposal to collapse under the pressure of financial markets and European leaders fear of them
Around the world the stock of financial assets has become so large relative to national income flows that financialmarket movements can overwhelm most countries
Even the largest economies are vulnerable particularly if they are highly dependent on debt finance
If for some reason financial markets andor China central bank were suddenly to reject US Treasury bonds interest rates would soar sending the American economy into recession
But being a creditor does not provide strong protection either
If Americans appetite for Chinese exports suddenly collapsed because of a financial panic in the United States China would find itself in serious economic trouble
These interlinked threats are real and they require much stronger global economicpolicy cooperation
Citizens however want to understand what is going on debate policies and give their consent to the types of cooperation proposed
Thus a more supranational form of politics is needed to reembed markets in democratic processes as happened during the course of the twentieth century with national politics and national markets
The scale of this challenge becomes apparent when one sees how difficult it is to coordinate economic policies even in the European Union which has moved much further than any other group of countries in the direction of supranational cooperation
Nonetheless unless globalization can be slowed down or partly reversed which is unlikely and undesirable in the long run the kind of olitics beyond borders for which Europe is groping will become a global necessity
Indeed the European crisis may be providing a mere foretaste of what will likely be the central political debate of the first half of the twentyfirst century how to resolve the tension between global markets and national politics
The Global Home
Homes are the most local of investments rooted to a particular place like a tree and thus thriving or withering in response to local economic conditions
The whole world flashes by on our television screens but the market for our homes which is comprised almost entirely of local amateurs remains grounded right there in our own backyard
Soon however this could all change
Within a month the Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME in collaboration with my company MacroMarkets as well as Fiserv and Standard  Poor will launch futures and options contracts on home prices in ten cities in the United States
The contracts will be settled on the SPCaseShiller Home Price Indices which developed out of academic work that my colleague Karl Case and I pioneered almost twenty years ago
For many years we have been campaigning for housing futures but no exchange wanted to use such indices to create a futures market until now
The futures markets on home prices will allow investors around the world to invest in US homes indirectly by buying interests in them through these markets
An investor in Paris Rio de Janeiro or Tokyo will be able to invest in owneroccupied homes in New York Los Angeles and Las Vegas
A fundamental principle of financial theory  iversification or isk spreading  implies that interest in the new contracts will be high
People and businesses in New York for example are overexposed to their local real estate risks so they should reduce this risk by selling New York home price futures
People in Tokyo will assume some of this risk by purchasing New York home price futures if the price is right
The New Yorkers still live in their own homes but now they have spread their investment risk worldwide
A genuine futures market on singlefamily homes has not been attempted since  when the London Futures and Options Exchange now merged into Euronextliffe failed in its effort to launch such a market in Britain
That attempt never generated much trading volume
The Exchange threw a party and no one came
British spreadbetting markets for home prices and some retail online markets have never amounted to much either
Will it be different this time
To be sure starting a new market is always an uncertain proposition people want to go to parties only if a lot of other people are there if no one is there no one wants to come
Likewise in markets without many investors not enough trades can be executed to generate the returns needed to attract them
As is often true of great parties it can be a bit of a mystery how substantial new markets get started but we know that it does happen from time to time
Initial indications suggest growing interest in futures trading for home prices particularly as so much talk about the ousing bubble underscores the importance of diversifying risk
After the CME announcement one of its competitors the Chicago Board Options Exchange said that it plans to create futures and options contracts on major US regions to be based on the median home price published by the National Association of Realtors
But aside from strong public interest in investing in housing and in hedging housing risks another critical issue must be resolved if futures markets are to succeed prices must be revealed and investors must understand what these prices mean
I believe there is a very good chance that many of these futures markets will soon be predicting substantial price declines in some US cities over the next year
They will be in what traders call ackwardation the future price in the market today is lower than the price of a home today
Maybe backwardation won appear on the first day that housing futures are traded but there is a good chance it will come within a matter of months
We may need backwardation in some of these markets if they are to fulfill their function
Everyone knows that there has been a huge real estate boom in many of these cities and elsewhere in the world in recent years
International investors are not likely to want to invest in these cities unless expectations of a price decline are built into the futures markets as people in Tokyo understand from their own bitter experience
But if backwardation is strong enough even investors who think that the US housing market is headed for a fall will still be able to expect a good return from home price futures because they are already getting a discounted price in the futures market
Nevertheless it will require some adjustment for New Yorkers seeking to hedge their own real estate investments to sell futures contracts that have a builtin price decline
They will have to get used to the idea that the market already expects the decline and that they can protect themselves only for that margin of possible future price declines that exceed this expectation
In fact such adjustments in our thinking will likely occur when we actually see the futures market prices
Until now the future course of real estate prices has been merely a matter of diverse opinion
When markets create an international consensus on the future price of homes in cities around the world we will be better able to manage the risks facing these cities thereby stabilizing their economies  and our own lives
The Global Imagination of Protest
NEW YORK  When graffiti appeared last spring on a wall near Tunisia interior ministry reading hank you Facebook it was not just praise for a socialmedia company that had facilitated the country uprising
It was also a celebration of the sense of shared experience that defined the Tunisian revolution  and the many other historic protests and revolutions that erupted in 
As we discovered collecting essays for our new book From Cairo to Wall Street Voices from the Global Spring one of the defining characteristics of the new age of protest is the dovetailing of the desire and the ability to connect  across neighborhoods cities countries and even continents
In every contributor country a new awareness of shared destinies and of a global community permeated protest movements
Socialmedia technology was one tool that advanced it but so was a reconceptualization of the meaning of public space and the view that a plurality of ideas is superior to dogma  that the act of collaboration is as important as the outcome
So these were not just political revolutions
They were also revolutions of ideas  the globalization of protest as a strategy
To be sure protesters grievances vary greatly according to local circumstances though there is surprising consistency across regions and even continents when it comes to issues like housing unemployment inequality and the frustration of young people who have studied hard and cannot find jobs
At the same time the philosophy of change through mass collaborative and inclusive action is common to  and crossfertilized between  almost every movement
Consider Tunisia where Mouheb Ben Garoui a  yearold activist writes in our book about how fellow citizens from all walks of life and no definite political affiliation poured out of their homes to occupy squares and demand a say in the country future
Facebook helped but mainly because it magnified and accelerated the process
As in other countries the very act of seizing territory meant a lot to protestors
In the squares of both Tunisia and Egypt demonstrators who had felt alienated and isolated under repressive regimes were overjoyed to discover that they were not alone
Sitting in the square became more than an act of defiance in Spain Greece and in the Occupy Movements of the United States and the United Kingdom the occupied zones became places where a new democratic society could be practiced sometimes through the timeconsuming General Assembly process of group decisionmaking
In Greece and Spain protesters told us that their neighbors stories were a revelation
People unburdened themselves to strangers
As Spain indignados sat in the squares they felt for the first time connected to the people in their communities  a feeling that became a large part of why they stayed
In our book the story of Egyptian protester Jawad Nabulsi  shows how some activists used technology to mobilize people
Nabulsi who worked for charities in Upper Egypt that raised money to provide running water and electricity to poor households wrote about how Malcolm Gladwell The Tipping Point and Jim Collins Good to Great affected his thinking about social change
 had gone to villages and slums saw the depth of problems in these places and assumed they could not be fixed
I tell myself hey are too humungous it like throwing something in the sea he writes
Reading Gladwell and Collins Nabulsi realized he didn need to change the whole country but just  circle of key players who could have an influence and that he eeded to focus on the leaders in the community and work with them
He began setting up Facebook groups in order to connect likeminded people
These groups took on a life of their own
Seeing that there were others who felt the same frustrations people became willing to make their voices heard in Tahrir Square and like the Spaniards rediscovered their community
Satellite tweets and Facebook statuses beamed that same message to the world
The immediate political results of this new connectivity are tenuous
Egypt Tunisia and Libya have had their regime change but it is unclear what role if any the young idealistic revolutionaries will play in their countries future
In Egypt the power of the military is more concentrated now than it was under former President Hosni Mubarak
In the US the protests of  will have a lasting effect only if Occupiers remain organized and continue their work on fighting foreclosures
They certainly will not feel motivated to turn out to support President Barack Obama reelection campaign if their voices are not heard in the White House as they were in Zuccotti Park and other public spaces from Oakland to Madison
But if the movements gains are uncertain the connectivity that they created is likely to endure
With American protesters citing Egyptians and Spaniards as direct inspiration online communities from Syria to Europe crosspollinating and continuing strong turnout for rallies like those on May Day  in the US it is clear that the spirit of community is here to stay
And worldwide it is clear that if politicians do not respond to demands for fairness freedom a more prosperous future and government that actually serves the people the protests will continue
The Global Impact of America Health Care Debate
CAMBRIDGE  Since assuming the presidency earlier this year Barack Obama primary legislative focus has been on reforming the financing of American health care
Yet his proposals are meeting strong opposition from fiscally conservative Democrats as well as from Republicans owing to their potential impact on future fiscal deficits
Because those deficits are the primary cause of America currentaccount deficit  and thus of global imbalances  the healthcare debate outcome will affect governments and investors around the world
About  of all Americans are now covered by some form of health insurance
All individuals over the age of  are eligible to be insured by the federal government through the Medicare program
Lowincome families and those whose income and assets are depleted by high medical costs are covered by the Medicaid program which is financed jointly by the states and federal government
Many uninsured get free care in emergency rooms of public and private hospitals and receive free care for chronic conditions in those same institutions
In the most recent budget the federal government outlays for Medicare in  are projected to be over  billion while Medicaid will cost taxpayers over  billion
Private health insurance is generally provided by employers which is encouraged by treating employer payments for health insurance as a taxdeductible business expense while not including the value of that insurance as taxable income to employees
That rule reduces income and payroll taxes by more than  billion
In short an overwhelming majority of Americans are insured with government a major financer of health care
But there remain about  million individuals who are not formally insured and some insured individuals still face the risk of financially ruinous medical costs if they have very expensive medical treatment
Obama campaigned on the goals that everyone should have health insurance that high medical costs should not bankrupt anyone and that increased efficiency in the production and delivery of care should slow the overall growth of healthcare costs
But rather than producing a specific proposal he left it to Congress to design the legislation
Several competing plans emerged from the different Congressional committees that have jurisdiction over the issue
The leading proposal produced by the Senate Finance Committee fails to achieve any of Obama goals
It would cut the number of uninsured roughly in half but would still leave about  million people uninsured  with the threat of ruinously high medical bills deterring them from getting care
There is also no clear plan to slow the growth of healthcare costs
As a sign of their support for the administration goals the pharmaceutical industry and the hospital industry have together promised to reduce costs by a total of about  billion a year  a token amount given government health spending of roughly  trillion and total health outlays of more than  trillion
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office CBO estimates that the Senate Finance Committee plan would cost about  billion between now and 
Most of this increased cost would in principle be financed by  billion of taxes on highpremium insurance policies and by about  billion of cuts in payments to physicians and hospitals that provide services to older patients in the Medicare program
If the cost and financing estimates are accurate and if Congress does not change any of these provisions in the future the CBO calculations imply that the Senate Finance Committee plan would reduce fiscal deficits between now and  by  billion less than  of the projected deficits of more than  trillion
In fact there is a strong risk that this legislation would ultimately add to the fiscal deficit
Increasing the number of insured by  million and broadening protection for some who are now insured implies increased demand for health care which could raise the cost of care paid for by the government as well as by private healthcare buyers
In addition both sources of financing are also uncertain
Taxes on highpremium insurance policies would lead many employees and employers to shift their sources of taxfree income from these healthinsurance benefits to other forms of untaxed compensation
If they do this the government would not collect the additional revenue from the insurance companies employers or employees
Similarly the proposed cuts in payments to providers of services to Medicare patients are unlikely to receive the necessary Congressional support in future years especially if it turns out that doing so would reduce the volume of services rather than just providers incomes
There is a long history of legislating such spending cuts only to reverse them in subsequent years
In considering the fiscal implications of Obama health proposals it is important that the current legislation would still leave  million individuals without insurance
How much would it cost to insure them if the gross cost is now projected at  billion for the easiertoinsure  million
And how could that cost be financed if the proposed taxes on existing health policies and the reductions in Medicare outlays have already been used
Closing that gap could add more than  trillion to the government cost over the next  years
It is clear that there is a significant danger that the current legislation would add substantially to future US deficits  and establish a precedent for even more expensive expansions of health care in the future
This would come on top of the currently projected fiscal deficits in both the near term and over the coming decade  and before America demographic shift substantially raises the cost of Social Security and Medicare
Surprisingly the bond market still seems almost oblivious to this risk
But holders of US debt worldwide have every reason to be concerned
The Global Impact of America Housing Crisis
CAMBRIDGE  The bursting of America housing bubble in the summer of  triggered the global financial crisis and recession
The sharp fall in house prices that followed caused a dramatic downturn in household wealth leading to lower consumer spending and an overall fall in GDP
By now wealth in the form of owneroccupied housing is down about  equivalent to a loss of more than  trillion of household wealth
The fall in house prices also led to a sharp rise in mortgage defaults and foreclosures which has increased the supply of homes on the market and caused house prices to fall further
As a result onethird of all American homeowners with mortgages are already nderwater  their mortgage debt exceeds the value of the house
For onesixth of these homes the debt is  higher than the price of the house
In addition high loantovalue ratios in the US interact with household financial problems to increase the number of defaults and foreclosures
More specifically the rising unemployment rate along with the large number of employees on involuntary parttime work has increased the number of people who cannot afford their monthly mortgage payments
Unlike virtually every other country US residential mortgages are effectively o recourse loans
If a homeowner stops making mortgage payments the creditor can take the property but cannot take other assets or a fraction of wages
Even in those states where creditors have the legal authority to take other assets or wage income the personal bankruptcy laws are so restrictive that creditors don bother to try
Although it is tempting to think of this as a purely domestic problem affecting the United States nothing could be further from the truth
When homeowners default banks lose money and uncertainty about the extent of future defaults undermines confidence in banks capital making it more difficult for them to raise funds and causing them to reduce their lending in order to conserve existing resources
As a result the recession has been deeper and longer than it would otherwise have been
The resulting weakness of the US economy will mean lower US import demand
And if the downward spiral in house prices continues the value of mortgagebacked securities held by financial institutions around the world will continue to decline affecting the supply of credit far beyond the US
Some recent data suggest that the decline in house prices may be coming to an end
The rate of decline of US house prices fell in the past three months for which we have data ending in May and the figures for May show essentially no decline at all
If that trend continues it will prevent further erosion of household wealth and strengthen the banks capital positions
But the recent data while encouraging may be the result of temporary factors rather than an indication that the fall in house prices has actually come to an end
Mortgage interest rates fell below  in March and April but have risen significantly since then
Moreover a government program of subsidies to firsttime homebuyers may have released a backlog of pentup demand
And banks had a voluntary moratorium on foreclosures holding supply off the market
All of this may have caused a temporary improvement in house prices
In short we will have to wait for the data on house prices in June and July to know whether there has been a permanent turnaround
The recent rise in existing home sales in the US may also be misleading since a large proportion are sales of foreclosed properties
Indeed property that has either been foreclosed or is on the verge of foreclosure now accounts for nearly onethird of all existing home sales
Foreclosed property is generally sold at auction guaranteeing that there will be a buyer  but driving down prices
Significantly foreclosures rose  month on month in June and a whopping  compared to June 
The Obama administration has enacted legislation aimed at helping individuals who are having difficulty making their monthly mortgage payments because of a decline in their incomes or a rise in the interest rate on their mortgage
For individuals with high monthly mortgage payments relative to their disposable income the US government will share with the creditor bank the cost of reducing the monthly payment to  of disposable income
This is a new program and it remains to be seen how well it will work to prevent future defaults
Some limited previous experience with mortgage modifications is not encouraging
Nearly  of those who had their mortgages modified nevertheless defaulted within six months
Unfortunately there is no program to deal with the defaults and foreclosures caused by high loantovalue ratios
Given the large number of negativeequity homeowners there is a risk that defaults and foreclosures will continue
If they do the sale of foreclosed properties will continue to depress house prices reducing household wealth and hurting financial institutions
Unless house prices have stopped declining it is important for the Obama administration to turn to the problem of high loantovalue ratios
That would help not only the US economy but also the economies of all of America trading partners
The World After November
MADRID  On November  either Barack Obama or Mitt Romney will emerge victorious after an exhausting electoral race setting the wheels in motion for the coming four years
An ocean away on November  more than  members of the Chinese Communist Party CCP will gather in Beijing
Approximately a week later the members of the Politburo Standing Committee will walk out in hierarchical order preparing to take charge of a growing country of  billion people
The leaders of the world two largest economies are changing
So is the world itself
The Middle East in particular is experiencing a moment of intense transformation
While reconstruction  both literal and figurative  is commencing in some parts of the region countries like Syria are aflame
Others such as Iran with its moribund revolution have never ceased rumbling
Amidst a crumbling economy the country remains belligerent using its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah to launch at least one successful drone flight above Israel and reportedly initiating recent cyber attacks
As a result relations among regional actors remain tense
After his speech at the United Nations appealing for a ed line on the Iranian nuclear program in the spring or summer of  Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu called an early general election which could potentially give him a strong mandate for action against Iran
Egypt meanwhile is finding its own equilibrium both domestically drafting a new constitution and in terms of foreign policy
Then there is Turkey straddling Europe and the Middle East
An emerging economy poised to become a regional power it has exchanged fire with its neighbor to the south Syria and has called on its NATO allies to bolster its security
This is part of the changing panorama that new world leaders will inherit in the Middle East  a region in which the United States has been deeply involved
After nearly a decade of draining military engagement the US combat mission in Iraq concluded in  and the combat mission in Afghanistan is set to end in 
The next American president will also inherit a country with a markedly changed geopolitical perspective
Technological advances and innovation have begun to turn the longstanding dream of energy independence into a reality
Whereas extraction of America extensive reserves of natural gas was previously thought to be unfeasible technologies such as hydraulic fracturing racking have ushered in a shalegas revolution
Indeed the US is on the cusp of energy selfsufficiency
Last year for the first time in  years less than onehalf of the oil consumed in the US was imported
Annual growth in shalegas production has increased from  between  and  to  between  and 
By  shale gas is projected to account for roughly onehalf of total US energy production
The repercussions of this revolution will not be only economic
Politically reduced reliance on foreign oil may allow the US to concentrate on its foreignpolicy shift toward Asia
But it is not just the new US leader who will inherit a changed world
Across the Pacific the days of recordbreaking economic growth in Asia  a key component of social and political stability  may be coming to an end
Indeed events in China in recent months have revealed internal unease
Though nationalist sentiment directed against external foes tends to divert attention temporarily from internal turmoil the country serious domestic problems need to be addressed
China economy and politics ideologically transformed in all but name will soon need to be adapted to address rising social inequality
Despite global economic headwinds China leaders will surely remain focused on maintaining and boosting growth in order to lift more Chinese out of poverty and avert social unrest they are also certain to continue monitoring the oilrich Middle East
After years of relying on America presence in the region playing an advantageous waiting game China next leaders may embrace a more active role
And because China reputation in the region is untainted by a legacy of imperialism they may be in a rather advantageous position to do so
Meanwhile the European Union is struggling with its own demons
Despite the EU need to focus inward while weathering the global economic crisis the Union must not abandon its neighbors to the south
It is crucial to engage with the southern Mediterranean region as a critical meeting point  a place of political economic and energy cooperation
In this respect the EU most valuable tools are its signature Nobel Prizewinning model of multilateral dialogue and soft power
Next door Russia too must respond to new vulnerabilities stemming from changing global conditions
The Kremlin continues to support Syrian President Bashar alAssad regime maintaining a strict aversion to military intervention and seeking to defend its strategic interests including its naval base in the Syrian city of Tartus
That stance has translated most obviously into repeated vetoes of UN Security Council resolutions aimed at ending a conflict that has already produced tens of thousands of victims
International inaction on Syria is bad news not only for the country people it is also eroding the legitimacy of one of the world most important multilateral institutions
Given that the issues of Iran and Syria are closely connected internal division among the Security Council five permanent members the US China Britain France and Russia could be extremely damaging to the search for a solution to Iran nuclearenrichment drive
That is reflected in the current stalemate in talks between them plus Germany and Iran
Too much is at stake which is why all possible tracks for a negotiated outcome must be pursued
Whether or not recent rumors of bilateral USIran talks prove true such initiatives should be welcomed
While the big players remain preoccupied with their internal changes the region continues to smolder
The main question now is whether the leaders who emerge in November will be firefighters or fire starters
America Broken Dream
WASHINGTON DC  The United States has long been viewed as the and of opportunity where those who work hard get ahead
Belief in this fundamental feature of America national identity has persisted even though inequality has been gradually rising for decades
But in recent years the trend toward extremes of income and wealth has accelerated significantly owing to demographic shifts the economy skills bias and fiscal policy
Is the collapse of the American dream at hand
From  to  the share of income accruing to the top  of US households increased by  percentage points
This is equivalent to shifting  trillion of Americans total annual income to these families  more than the total income of the bottom  of US households
Inequality precise impact on individual wellbeing remains controversial partly because of the complex nature of the metrics needed to gauge it accurately
But while objective indicators do not provide a complete picture of the relationship between income inequality and human wellbeing how they are interpreted sends important signals to people within and across societies
If inequality is perceived to be the result of just reward for individual effort it can be a constructive signal of future opportunities
But if it is perceived to be the result of an unfair system that rewards a privileged few inequality can undermine individuals motivation to work hard and invest in the future
In this sense current US trends have been largely destructive
Economic mobility for example has declined in recent decades and is now lower than in many other industrialized countries as well including Canada Finland Germany Japan and New Zealand
An American worker initial position in the income distribution is highly predictive of his or her future earnings
Moreover there is a strong intergenerational income correlation about  in the US with the children of parents who earn say  more than the average likely to earn  above their generation average
Indeed the US now lies near the middle of the World Bank ranking of economic opportunity well below countries like Norway Italy Poland and Hungary
Some argue that as long as the US maintains its economic dynamism leadership in technological innovation and attractiveness to immigrants income inequality is irrelevant
But other pertinent trends  such as failing public schools crumbling infrastructure rising crime rates and ongoing racial disparities in access to opportunities  seem to refute such claims
After all having some of the world top universities means little if access to them is largely a function of family income
This does not matter only to Americans
In a world in which individuals fates are increasingly linked and effective governance depends on some consensus on norms of social and distributive justice growing income differentials in one country  especially one that has long served as a beacon of economic opportunity  can shape behavior elsewhere
Without the belief that hard work begets opportunity people are less likely to invest in education undermining labormarket development they may even be driven to protest
More generally declining economic mobility in the US could undermine confidence in the principles of a market economy and democratic governance that America has espoused for decades  principles that are fundamental to many countries development strategies
As Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz has pointed out The extent to which the global economy and polity can be shaped in accord with our values and interests will depend to a large extent on how well our economic and political system is performing for most citizens
Given increasing evidence that the system is performing much better for wealthier citizens than for poorer ones America soft power seems bound to erode substantially
Reducing inequality will require longterm comprehensive solutions such as fiscalpolicy reforms that reward public investment in health and education without adding disincentives to an already cumbersome tax code
But pursuing such measures requires significant political will which the US seems to be lacking
Indeed given political paralysis at the national level initiating a constructive debate about an issue as divisive and consequential as inequality will depend largely on the American public
If more people recognized the constraints that inequality places on their future prospects they would be likely to press policymakers to confront it
This would not only benefit the US it would have a positive impact on global governance
Americans have long prided themselves on their country status as the land of opportunity a destination that people have endured immeasurable adversity to reach
A publiceducation campaign aimed at highlighting the challenges that inequality poses to the very foundation of this reputation is a lowrisk first step toward reviving America promise

Mental Health for All
MELBOURNE  One spring evening in  when I was a mentalhealth researcher at the Australian National University in Canberra I was discussing with my wife Betty Kitchener a registered nurse who taught firstaid courses for the Red Cross in her spare time the inadequacy of conventional firstaid training
Such courses typically neglect mentalhealth emergencies leaving participants poorly equipped to help people who are struggling with suicidal thoughts panic attacks posttraumatic stress the effects of alcohol or drug abuse or a diminishing grip on reality
Betty knew firsthand the potential consequences of this lack of knowledge
When she was  she experienced an episode of severe depression which culminated in a suicide attempt
But her family and teachers failed to recognize the problem so she received no support or professional help
This lack of early treatment undermined her recovery and she has continued to experience episodes of depression throughout her life
In order to help ensure that more people did not have to suffer alone as Betty had we resolved to create a mentalhealth firstaid training course in our local community
Three years later when Betty reduced her paid employment in order to develop Mental Health First Aid training we were finally able to launch the course
The benefits of this initiative quickly became apparent with evaluation studies showing that participants became more accepting of the health significance of mental illnesses more confident in their ability to help others and motivated to apply their knowledge after completing the course
Such positive results helped to drive the course expansion
By  it was operating across Australia and in Scotland and Hong Kong and has since spread to more than  other countries
Over  people in Australia alone  more than  of the population  have now received the training
This rapid growth should not be surprising given the prevalence of mentalhealth problems worldwide
In Australia roughly one in five adults is affected by a diagnosable mentalhealth problem each year but many of these people receive no professional help
The statistics are similar in other developed countries
This means that everyone will either be personally affected by a mentalhealth problem or have close contact with someone who is
Indeed most people will have contact whether they are aware of it or not with someone who is suicidal
Research shows that whether or not a person obtains professional help is strongly influenced by the encouragement and attitudes of those close to them
People with strong support networks have a significantly better chance of recovery than those whose problems go undetected or are ignored or minimized
Given this ensuring awareness and acceptance in communities while enhancing people ability to identify potential mentalhealth problems in others and to provide help is vitally important
This need is particularly pressing for those  such as parents teachers youth workers and sports coaches  who are in regular contact with young people
Mentalhealth problems tend to arise early in life with the first episode occurring during adolescence or early adulthood  a critical phase of development when people are completing their education joining the work force building key relationships and forming health habits
Without a strong support system mentalhealth problems can disrupt these developments damaging the future prospects of those whom they affect
While the Mental Health First Aid course rapid expansion has helped to improve the situation in many communities there is much left to do
In the short term all developed countries should aim to achieve  participation rates in mentalhealth firstaid courses as Australia has
In the longer term countries should aim to match participation rates in conventional firstaid courses
In the last three years  of Australia population has completed such a course partly owing to requirements that people in certain positions such as childcare workers have a firstaid certificate
Requiring that people in particular occupations  including highschool teachers nurses and police officers  acquire a mentalhealth firstaid certificate would significantly enhance participation thereby strengthening support for those who are struggling with mentalhealth problems
Such certifications are even more important in the developing world given the limited availability of mentalhealth professionals
Pilot work in rural India shows that the mentalhealth firstaid approach can be successfully adapted to the needs of communities with limited resources
In developed and developing countries alike the scope of the problem is too large to be left exclusively to mentalhealth professionals
Every member of the community must be empowered to protect and improve their own mental health and that of those around them
Transatlantic Trade Goes Global
STANFORD  Negotiations have now commenced between the United States and the European Union on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership TTIP potentially the largest regional freetrade agreement in history
If successful it would cover more than  of global GDP and account for large shares of world trade and foreign direct investment
The US and EU have set an ambitious goal of completing negotiations by the end of 
Historically however most trade agreements have taken much longer to complete
The scale of the TTIP is enormous
With Croatia accession at the beginning of July the EU now consists of  member states each of which has its own particular set of special interests pressing for trade promotion or protection based on comparative advantage history and raw domestic political power
Moreover the desired scope of the agreement is vast complicating the process further
The TTIP would eliminate all trade tariffs and reduce nontariff barriers including in agriculture expand market access in services trade bring about closer regulatory harmonization strengthen intellectualproperty protection restrict subsidies to stateowned enterprises and more
This all but guarantees difficult talks ahead indeed France has already demanded and received a ultural exception for film and TV
Expanding trade boosts income on average in all the countries involved
Economists estimate that global free trade enabled by many successful rounds of multilateral talks most recently the Uruguay Round culminating in the establishment of the World Trade Organization has boosted worldwide income substantially
Regional freetrade agreements FTAs such as the TTIP do so as well but some of the gains may come at the expense of other trade partners
Within each country despite net gains there are also some losers
The best way to deal with the economic political and humanitarian concerns raised by trade agreements is via transition rules temporary income support and retraining as opposed to maintaining protectionist barriers
The gains from such pacts stem from a variety of factors the most important of which is comparative advantage countries specialize in producing the goods and services that they are relatively most efficient at producing and trade these goods and services for others
Economies of scale and other factors are also important
As the scope of trade liberalization shrinks so do the benefits  more than proportionally Estimates of the annual gains from a fully realized TTIP are  billion for the EU and  billion for the US
British Prime Minister David Cameron predicts two million new jobs
And a noninflationary boost to growth in a weak global economy would be particularly timely
But the devil is in the details
Tariffs are generally modest already so gains from their further reduction would be modest as well
It is vital to remove nontariff barriers such as localized rules and restrictions not based on scientifically legitimate safety or health concerns despite political pressure to maintain or tighten them
Limiting the scope of trade and investment covered by the TTIP would likewise reduce the benefits
Trade negotiations become either broad and deep or narrow and limited
NAFTA for example followed the former route greatly boosting trade among the US Canada and Mexico
Its copycat SAFTA the South Asian Free Trade Agreement moved slowly to reduce tariffs and the list of excluded items so India signed separate bilateral FTAs with Bangladesh and Sri Lanka
The TTIP is being divided into  specific working groups
While the negotiations are new the issues separating the two sides are longstanding and widely known
One of the most difficult is the EU limitation of imports of genetically modified foods which presents a major problem for US agriculture
Another is financial regulation with US banks preferring EU rules to the more stringent framework emerging at home such as the much higher capital standards for large banks recently proposed by America financial regulators
Several other serious disagreements also stand in the way of a comprehensive deal
For example US pharmaceutical companies have stronger intellectualproperty protection at home than in the EU
Entertainment will become increasingly contentious with online distribution of films
And the anachronistic  Jones Act requires cargo carried between US ports to be shipped only on American ships recall the confusion about the possibility of foreign ships coming to help during the BP Gulf oil spill
Safety regulations and restrictions on foreign control of companies in sensitive industries are further points of contention
The TTIP is not just about the US and the EU
Mexico already has an FTA with the EU and Canada is negotiating one
At some point NAFTA and TTIP will need to be harmonized
Meanwhile the world other countries  still accounting for more than half of world GDP and the bulk of global trade and FDI  are wondering how the TTIP would affect each of them
One possibility suggested by my excolleague former US Trade Representative Carla Hills is that a successful TTIP would be a major impetus for rekindling the moribund Doha Round of global freetrade talks
The Uruguay Round received a similar boost soon after NAFTA was signed
Everyone everywhere has an interest in how the TTIP talks develop and in what ultimately results from them
To take a simple example more reasonable EU rules on genetically modified agricultural imports from North America if translated with appropriately careful monitoring to Africa could be a tremendous boon to African agriculture
Failure to make any inroads on this score in the TTIP negotiations would almost certainly block genetically modified food in Africa
Analogous issues arise in sector after sector and in one regulation after another
We can hope but in no way guarantee that the details agreed at the end of the TTIP negotiations justify the enthusiasm at their start

Focal Point
The Global Innovation Revolution
BERKELEY  As countries around the world struggle to lay the foundations for stronger sustainable growth in the future they would do well to focus on policies that encourage innovation
Empirical studies across time and countries confirm that innovation is the primary source of technological change and productivity growth
And investments in research and development as well as in the scientific and engineering workforce on which they depend are critical drivers of innovation and national competitiveness
A new study by the National Science Board the governing body of the National Science Foundation in the United States examines trends in such investments for both individual countries and regions
These trends indicate that the global landscape for innovation changed significantly during the last decade
That landscape is likely to change further as several Asian economies particularly China and South Korea increase their investments in RampD and scientific and engineering education to secure their place as significant hubs of innovation
At the same time crushing debt burdens may compel the US Europe and Japan to reduce their investments in these areas
The US remains the global leader in RampD investment spending an estimated  billion in   a total boosted by President Barack Obama stimulus package and higher than China Japan and Germany combined
But in terms of RampD spending as a share of GDP the US ranked only eighth in  at  of GDP
The US share remained above the OECD average but this was mainly the result of national differences in the amount of RampD defense spending
Indeed defense accounted for  of US RampD in  and for more than  during the last  years
The defense share of RampD in the European Union and Japan has been and remains markedly lower  less than  in the EU and less than  in Japan in  no comparable data are available for China and South Korea
Over the next decade sizeable cuts in defense spending as part of overall deficit reduction could mean a significant reduction in RampD investment in the US
Between  and  global RampD spending grew at an average annual rate of  accelerating to  during the last five years despite the global recession
During the entire period RampD spending grew significantly faster than global output reflecting both increasing government support and a rising share of technologyintensive industries in global production and trade
But these aggregate figures obscure differences among countries and regions
Over the decade the US share of global RampD fell from  to  the EU share fell from  to  and Asia share rose from  to 
Within Asia RampD spending in China grew at an astounding  annual pace twice the country GDP growth rate  and by  China had surpassed Japan to become the world secondlargest investor in RampD Spending on RampD also grew rapidly  about  annually  in South Korea
By contrast RampD spending grew by  in Japan  in the US and roughly  in Europe
Throughout the world the business sector remains both the predominant performer and the predominant funder of RampD investment
In  business accounted for  of RampD funding in Japan  in South Korea  in China  in Germany and  in the US whose companies are the largest RampD investors in terms of absolute purchasing power spending more than twice as much as Japanese businesses
But business investment as a share of GDP has changed very little in the US over the last decade while it has risen rapidly in many other countries including China Singapore South Korea and Israel
Global multinational companies are the largest businesssector RampD investors in the US and other countries
For example multinational companies whether headquartered in the US or elsewhere accounted for about  of private nonbank RampD investment in the US in  about the same as a decade earlier
And US multinationals still locate about  of their RampD activities in the US often in innovation clusters around research universities
But this share has declined during the last decade as US multinationals have shifted some of their RampD from the US and Europe to Asia in response to rapidly growing markets ample scientific and engineering talent and generous subsidies
Global competition for multinational companies RampD activity and for the local benefits that it brings is likely to intensify in the future with many countries already offering sizeable tax credits and extended tax holidays
The Asian economies have been particularly aggressive in the use of such incentives
And recognizing that the availability of a workforce with the necessary skills is a key determinant of where businesses locate their RampD activities many countries are increasing their investments in tertiary education and training in science engineering and technology
Engineering accounts for only  of all bachelor degrees in the US compared to  in Asia  which now accounts for half of all engineering degrees being awarded  and  in China
Many countries are also changing their immigration laws to make it easier to attract highly skilled workers especially scientists and engineers who are increasingly mobile
Meanwhile immigration policies in the US and Europe are making it more difficult to attract and retain such workers compelling companies to shift RampD abroad to find the talent that they need
As a result of these changes the global landscape for innovation has been transformed over the last decade
Ours is now a world in which many emergingmarket countries have made advancement in science and technology a top priority and in which multinational companies RampD investments have become much more mobile
As the US and other developed countries embark on austerity plans to contain their debt they must heed these changes in the innovation landscape and boost their investments in RampD  and in science and engineering education  even as they make painful cuts elsewhere
The Global Jobs Challenge
NEW YORK  Over the past three decades hundreds of millions of new workers have entered the global economy
They arrived with various levels of education and skill and over time have generally gained in terms of uman capital  and in terms of value added and income
This has brought a tremendous and ongoing growth in income levels opportunities and the size of the global economy
But these new workers have also brought more employment competition and significant shifts in relative wages and prices which is having profound distributional effects
These massive structural changes in the global economy present three great employment challenges worldwide with different countries facing their own variants
The first challenge is to generate enough jobs to accommodate the inflow of new entrants into the labor market
Clearly a wide range of advanced and developing countries is failing to do so
Youth unemployment is high and rising
Even in fastgrowth developing countries surplus labor is awaiting inclusion in the modern economy and the pressure is on to sustain job creation
The second challenge is to match skills and capabilities to the supply of jobs  an adjustment that takes time
It is also a moving target
Globalization and major laborsaving technologies have thrown labor markets in many countries into disequilibrium
Skills mismatches abound
Moreover with continuing rapid growth in developing countries the global economy structure is far from static and it seems clear that the pace of market adjustment is lagging that of structural change
The third challenge is distributional
As the tradable part of the global economy goods and services that can be produced in one country and consumed in another expands competition for economic activity and jobs broadens
That affects the price of labor and the range of employment opportunities within all globally integrated economies
Subsets of the population gain and others lose certainly relative to expectations  and often absolutely
Many advanced countries  in fact most of them  have experienced limited middleincome growth
In some European countries where income inequality has remained in check this has been a component of a deliberate strategy to maintain employment growth and competitiveness in the tradable part of the economy with wage restraint partly shared across the income distribution
In the United States income inequality has risen as the upper end of the income and education spectrum benefits from globalization while the rest experience declining employment opportunities in the tradable sector
For two decades prior to the  crisis employment levels were maintained  and downward pressure on incomes mitigated  by creating jobs in nontradable sectors
In some cases this took the form of rapid growth in government in others like the US a pattern of excessive debtfueled consumption underpinned a large shift in employment to nontradable services and construction
Indeed government and health care both largely nontradable accounted for almost  of net employment growth in the US between  and 
That pattern came to a sudden stop in the financial crisis of 
Privatesector leverage declined and publicsector leverage reached  and exceeded  sustainable limits with Greece being only the most extreme example
But expectations created by precrisis growth patterns adjust slowly
Because the dominant narrative still maintains that the precrisis period was normal at least in terms of the growth pattern in the real economy the perceived challenge is to restore growth according to the precrisis pattern
Unfortunately this narrative cannot explain why particularly in the advanced countries growth is faltering and the employment engines have largely shut down
Part of the answer consists in the long lingering impact of financial crises and deleveraging well documented by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff in their book This Time is Different
At the same time the financial imbalances and distortions that precede a crisis delay appropriate and necessary responses to technological and global market forces in the real economy as well
In short economies and policies adjusted in an unsustainable fashion to some extent obscuring the need for a more sustainable pattern of adaptation
What does it mean  for individuals businesses and governments  that structural adjustment is falling further and further behind the global forces that are causing pressure for structural change
Above all it means that expectations are broadly inconsistent with reality and need to adjust in some cases downward
But distributional effects need to be taken seriously and addressed
The burden of weak or nonexistent recoveries should not be borne by the unemployed including the young
In the interest of social cohesion market outcomes need to be modified to create a more even distribution of incomes and benefits both now and in intertemporal terms
After all underinvestment now implies diminished opportunity in the future
The imperative of structural adjustment also implies that individuals governments and other institutions especially schools need to focus on increasing the speed of adjustment to meet rapidly shifting market conditions
Attention to both the demand and supply sides of job markets is required
This means not only matching skills to jobs but also expanding the range of jobs to match skills
Finally global economicmanagement institutions need to address whether the pace of globalization and its implied structural change is faster than the capacity of individuals economies and societies to adjust can withstand
If so the next challenge will be to find nondestructive ways to moderate the pace in order to bring capacity to adjust and the need for adjustment into closer alignment
None of this will be easy
We do not now have well developed frameworks for understanding structural change
Nevertheless the unemployed and underemployed especially younger people expect their leaders and institutions to try
The Global Roots of EuroJitters
FLORENCE  It is too simplistic to explain the current wave of concern about the euro in terms of Greece problems
Greece has massive fiscal and competitiveness problems but Greece  of the population of the European Union is smaller than California  of the population of the United States
And California too is suffering massive fiscal difficulties and declining competitiveness in some of the industries in which Californians were once pioneers
The euro current problems are instead a reflection of unresolved Europewide and global problems
The common currency is the canary in the mine of the global exchangerate system
The euro precisely measures international tensions in that it is a bold experiment a currency that is not linked to a state but rather follows from international rules and treaties
It is a creature of the intellect rather than a product of power
It is a postmodern or postsovereign currency
But in the aftermath of a crisis countries put national interests above their willingness to go along with international rules
The creation of money is often thought to be the domain of the state this was the prevalent doctrine of the nineteenth century reaching its apogee in the German economist Georg Friedrich Knapp The State Theory of Money 
In the New Testament Christ famously answers a question about obedience to civil authorities by examining a coin and telling the Pharisees ender unto Caesar what is Caesar
Unlike most banknotes and coins there is no picture of the state or its symbols  no Caesar  on the money managed by the European Central Bank
There has always been a close relationship between European monetary integration and global problems
Europeans thought that their close geographic proximity and shared cultural inheritance might enable them to produce answers where global debates had become stalled
When things did not work out globally a regional solution might be possible
The impetus to the first act of European monetary integration the  Werner Report stemmed from awareness that there were major difficulties in the fixed exchangerate system established in  at the Bretton Woods conference
Nobody outside the US could force it to restrain either its monetary policy which was becoming increasingly expansive under President Richard Nixon or its fiscal policy marked by mushrooming deficits due to the costs of the Vietnam war
Policymakers in France loved to quote a remark by the French poet Paul Valry who in the middle of the chaos of the Great Depression had written that urope visibly aspires to be governed by an American committee
To Europeans the International Monetary Fund which supervised exchangerate arrangements in the postBretton Woods world looked like a perfectly American committee and France did not like that
The Werner Report ideas were too feeble to deal with the currency turmoil of the early  and it was almost a decade before Europe produced a new response
The European Monetary System began as a highlevel reaction to global currency chaos and in particular to the depreciation of the dollar in  and  which seemed to threaten its continued role as the major international reserve currency
The process that began with the report of the Delors Committee in  and led to the Maastricht Treaty in  the establishment of the euro in  and the introduction of the physical currency in  was rooted in an attempt to devise mechanisms that would generate a more stable global exchangerate regime
The critical policy innovators of the late  in particular the highly activist French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur took an international answer and started to advocate its realization on the European level
At the G meeting of finance ministers in Louvre in February  Balladur suggested a system of currency target zones when its realization proved problematic he pushed on with a more definitive and tighter European version of the scheme
What resulted was a partly flawed answer to the problem
That was because France and Germany the principal protagonists in the drama of monetary integration had different visions of how the problem should be solved
The Germans pressed for clearly defined fiscal rules but other countries wanted more wiggle room
The French argued for European economic governance alongside the monetary union but that looked to others as imposing too much French planisme 
A watereddown version of the German solution was eventually adopted
Today as in the  or  we face a fundamentally global problem of inconsistent monetary policies
Back then Europeans complained that low interest rates in America were driving global inflation now low US interest rates are blamed for driving irresponsible assetprice booms
Indeed low US interest rates though an appropriate domestic response to the financial crisis have pushed a global carry trade in which people borrow in dollars to fund investments in the apparently less crisishit large emergingmarket economies
These large transactions are funneled through the international banking system
The answers to a global problem of this kind cannot be found on a European level
It will demand global coordination of monetary policies and some form of global economic governance
Europe tried this combination and found that even in a regional setting it could not be fully realized
Instead an imperfect answer produced heightened vulnerability
The result is that Europe has made itself into the primary victim of the financial crisis
The Globalization of Ethics
Many Europeans doubt that Asia can catch up with Europe in terms of regional integration
But Asia not only has the type of stable common ethical foundations that were so important to European integration it also has a well developed set of moral principles some of which were an established part of Asian culture long before similar principles were adopted in Europe
Indeed these Asian principles can serve as a part of an emerging common global ethic
Of course Asia does not yet have a cohesive core culture comparable to that of Europe which is founded on the JudeoChristian tradition and the Enlightenment
But Europeans ought not to be too arrogant because in recent years that common European culture has itself proven to be fragile particularly in light of the Bush administration divideandrule strategy pitting ld Europe against ew Europe
And just as the inhuman terror attacks of September   severely damaged Islam credibility in many people eyes the invasion of Iraq which was based on lies has damaged both Christianity and the Western community of values
Although Asia seems to lack Europe cultural core there are core ethical constants that have long governed Asian societies and indicate common ethical foundations
Indeed in some respect Asia has more experience with intercultural relations than Europe
As early as the third century BC Buddhism spread peacefully from India to Sri Lanka and to large parts of Southeast Asia
In the first century CE it continued its advance spreading along the Silk Road to Central Asia and China and finally made its way to Korea and Japan centuries later
Ethnically homogeneous Japan is an example of how three different religions  Shinto Confucianism and Buddhism  can coexist peacefully and in many cases intermingle
Even Islam  which mostly spread in the wake of military conquests in the Middle East India and North Africa  expanded rather peacefully into Southeast Asia in the footsteps of merchants scholars and mystics
Moreover there was a historically important and ethically oriented humanism in China as early as the fifth century BC The concept of en which corresponds to our umanum is a central term in the Chinese tradition
Likewise Confucius was the first to formulate the Golden Rule of Reciprocity ever impose on others what you would not choose for yourself
Through the spread of Chinese characters the concept of ren and the Golden Rule spread throughout the vast Chineseinfluenced area that reaches from Central Asia to Taiwan and from Korea to Singapore
This Golden Rule however also appears in the Indian tradition
In Jainism it is stated as  man should wander about treating all creatures as he himself would be treated
In Buddhism  state that is not pleasant or delightful to me must also be so to him and a state that is not pleasing or delightful to me how could I inflict that upon another
In Hinduism ne should not behave towards others in a way which is disagreeable to oneself
This is the essence of morality
This olden Rule can also of course be found in the Abrahamic religions
Rabbi Hillel  BC said hat is hurtful to yourself do not do to your fellow man
Jesus worded it positively o in everything do to others what you would have them do to you
Islam too has a similar concept one of you believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself
Moreover such commonalities go beyond the principle of humanity and the Golden Rule of Reciprocity
Four concrete ethical rules were laid down in the Buddhist canon by Patanjali the founder of Yoga in the Chinese tradition and of course in the three prophetic religions o not kill o not steal o not bear false witness and o not abuse sexuality
These transcultural ethical rules form structural elements of a common human ethic whatever we call it and make almost irrelevant the idea of a deep antagonism between sian and estern values
If Asia focuses on its transcultural ethical core an entirely new spirit of unity can be developed that uses soft power instead of military force and does not know enemies but only partners and competitors
In this way Asia could catch up with the West in terms of its cultural integration while contributing to the establishment of a genuinely peaceful new world order
This project differs from the West human rights movement which is based on natural law thinking
The point is rather to integrate values standards and attitudes of ethicalreligious traditions that while appearing in each culture in a specific form are common to all and that can be supported by nonreligious people as well
The Globalization of Mass Politics
Globalization has assumed a new form global mass politics
Of course political protests have been global for decades as past marches against the Vietnam War nuclear weapons and globalization itself demonstrated
The revolutions of  and  in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union blanketed a huge region within months
But the antiIraq War protests reveal a new dynamic
Up to  million protestors in some  countries and  cities took to the streets on schedule on a single day February  showing that mass politics can now be approached globally
Communications and mass media have long enabled copycat effectsprotests in one place ignite similar actions elsewhere
The overthrow of King Louis Phillipe in France in  was carried by the recently introduced telegraph to Germany igniting revolution
Television images of the fall of the Berlin Wall spurred revolutionary changes throughout the former Soviet bloc
On other occasions protests such as May Day marches were transformed into widespread social mobilization as happened in France on May  
What is distinctive about the recent mass protests against US plans for a war against Iraq is that the February  event was planned ahead of time at short notice for a specific date and with an explicit goal of worldwide scale
The decision to launch February  as a day of mass protest was apparently taken at a meeting of activists at the European Social Forum in Florence in November last year
In ninety days these organizers turned out more than  million protestors worldwide
There are three keys to this phenomenon
The Internet allowed for a rapid worldwide dissemination of organizational plans at an extraordinarily low cost to the organizers
Mass action depended on local organizations seizing the initiative based on a loose global plan
This is what network theorists call selforganizing behavior
As each unit took its own steps these local actions were communicated to the rest of the world through Web sites that tracked and disseminated global plans as well as offering information advice and encouragement
A worldwide common concern the prospect of an Iraq War
There was a fourth specific feature fuelling the global protests too the exceptionally high level of arrogance and ineptitude displayed by the Bush Administration
US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld provoked the worlds ire through a mocking disdain for global public opinion
Rumsfelds juvenile attack on old Europe no doubt helped bring millions into the streets
Indeed its no longer possible in an age of mass communication to play to the home audience without the world also listening
Bushs swaggering style plays well in Texas but not in Paris and Berlin
It is unlikely that worldwide protests will stop the Bush Administrations war plans but they will help shape the political security and economic ramifications of such a war
The war is likely to proceed because the US can carry out the military phase of the war largely on its own and because the Bush Administration has no easy way to back down from its military mobilization
Moreover the uncertainties over war are hurting Americas economy and economies elsewhere by causing a postponement of business plans and falling consumer confidence
If todays stalemate drags on the weak economy will threaten Bushs reelection bid in November 
His political advisors may well advise him that it will soon be now or never to launch the war
But America will pay dearly for launching a war against global public opinion
Unless the Bush administration is vindicated in its actionsfor example if Saddam Hussein launches weapons of mass destruction that unite the world against him or if the US discovers hidden nuclear weapons in the Iraqi desertantiAmerican sentiments and terrorism unleashed by war are likely to be massive
Americas people have never been told about the huge financial and political burdens that lie ahead and they are not ready to bear them
Already the US is facing huge fiscal deficits and a squeeze on popular programs even before the costs of war and its aftermath are taken into account
Cheap and instantaneous means of global communication are here to stay
February  demonstrates that people throughout the world will use them to demand their right to help shape global political decisions
The Globalization of Old Age
Antiglobalization campaigners gripe that the rich are getting richer
Thats true in many ways
But rich countries are also getting older
This graying of the worlds richest nations will profoundly affect not only these societies but poorer countries as well
According to the UN the worlds population now stands at  billion and will reach  billion by midcentury
People aged  or more are projected to increase from  million now to nearly  billion by 
Furthermore the elderly population itself is aging
The  age group makes up the fastestgrowing segment of the population its share of the over population will increase from  to  by 
This graying of the world is a natural result of falling fertility rates and rising life expectancy
While the decline in fertility is global its speed varies across countries
Rich countries in Europe North America and East Asia have a sharply higher share of the elderly than developing countries
Fertility reductions in the richer parts of the world have already brought population growth rates close to zero
Furthermore due to improved access to quality health care and better living conditions life spans in rich countries are now much longer than in the developing world
People aged  or more represent almost  of the population in rich countries today whereas in the world as a whole this ratio is not expected to be reached before 
By that point this age group in industrial countries will claim onethird of the total population
It will take another century for the rest of the world to catch up
One result of all this is that the relative number of workingage individuals between  who pay the taxes to support pensioners is declining much faster in the industrial world than in developing countries where populations remain young and grow rapidly
Rich economies are already challenged by this decline and so are scrambling to meet the insatiable demands of public pension and health care systems which causes their fiscal balances to deteriorate
The effects of population aging will become even more obvious and widespread in the decades ahead as domestic labor supply in rich countries shrinks even further
Moreover because the elderly tend to spend more and save less rich countries will also face changes in the ratio of savings to consumption in their national income as well as in the composition of what is purchased
These demographically induced developments will not only affect investment and growth patterns of industrial economies but the allocation of resources as well
In a globalized world what happens in rich countries has an impact on developing economies
Yet there is little discussion of the opportunities and challenges this presents
Nowadays most talk focuses on migration as a means of letting overpopulated developing countries fill the labor shortages of developed countries with graying populations
Japans population for example is projected to decline by  million by  while the share of its  population will climb to  and the share of its  population will exceed 
The number of workingage Japanese will thus fall sharply bringing the ratio of workers to retirees to about one
Estimates suggest that Japan would need  million immigrants per year until  just to maintain the ratio of workers to pensioners that it had in 
Will developed countries really allow for migration on such a scale
Or will they instead increase their imports of manufactured products and food thus creating jobs in developing countries that might help absorb their surplus labor
Even if rich countries choose increased imports the growing volume of trade will merely expand an existing channel for routing the effects of an aging population onto developing countries
Trade serves as such a channel because nations with aging populations are economically powerful and so are capable of setting the terms on which they trade with poorer countries
Developing countries that trade intensively with advanced economies must adopt their relative prices and allocate their resources accordingly
But these relative prices will increasingly reflect the changed demands of the aging citizenry of industrial nations
International capital flows will also magnify such demographic spillover effects as capital is traded at the interest rates determined in large industrial economies
These rates will increasingly be influenced by the changing age composition within advanced countries
Because the old save less lower aggregate savings in rich countries will crimp the relative abundance of capital available to poorer economies
The powerful combination of globalization and aging will make developing economies ever more susceptible to changes in the terms of trade interest rates and exchange rates in rich countries
All developing countries should monitor these demographic developments closely even if they have yet to experience population aging themselves
Young nations such as Mexico and Turkey should be particularly careful due to their strong economic ties with NAFTA and the EU where the gradual aging of populations is well under way
The Globalization of Protest
NEW YORK  The protest movement that began in Tunisia in January subsequently spreading to Egypt and then to Spain has now become global with the protests engulfing Wall Street and cities across America
Globalization and modern technology now enables social movements to transcend borders as rapidly as ideas can
And social protest has found fertile ground everywhere a sense that the ystem has failed and the conviction that even in a democracy the electoral process will not set things right  at least not without strong pressure from the street
In May I went to the site of the Tunisian protests in July I talked to Spain indignados from there I went to meet the young Egyptian revolutionaries in Cairo Tahrir Square and a few weeks ago I talked with Occupy Wall Street protesters in New York
There is a common theme expressed by the OWS movement in a simple phrase e are the 
That slogan echoes the title of an article that I recently published entitled f the  for the  and by the  describing the enormous increase in inequality in the United States  of the population controls more than  of the wealth and receives more than  of the income
And those in this rarefied stratum often are rewarded so richly not because they have contributed more to society  bonuses and bailouts neatly gutted that justification for inequality  but because they are to put it bluntly successful and sometimes corrupt rentseekers
This is not to deny that some of the  have contributed a great deal
Indeed the social benefits of many real innovations as opposed to the novel financial roducts that ended up unleashing havoc on the world economy typically far exceed what their innovators receive
But around the world political influence and anticompetitive practices often sustained through politics have been central to the increase in economic inequality
And tax systems in which a billionaire like Warren Buffett pays less tax as a percentage of his income than his secretary or in which speculators who helped to bring down the global economy are taxed at lower rates than those who work for their income have reinforced the trend
Research in recent years has shown how important and ingrained notions of fairness are
Spain protesters and those in other countries are right to be indignant here is a system in which the bankers got bailed out while those whom they preyed upon have been left to fend for themselves
Worse the bankers are now back at their desks earning bonuses that amount to more than most workers hope to earn in a lifetime while young people who studied hard and played by the rules see no prospects for fulfilling employment
The rise in inequality is the product of a vicious spiral the rich rentseekers use their wealth to shape legislation in order to protect and increase their wealth  and their influence
The US Supreme Court in its notorious Citizens United decision has given corporations free rein to use their money to influence the direction of politics
But while the wealthy can use their money to amplify their views back on the street police wouldn allow me to address the OWS protesters through a megaphone
The contrast between overregulated democracy and unregulated bankers did not go unnoticed
But the protesters are ingenious they echoed what I said through the crowd so that all could hear
And to avoid interrupting the ialogue by clapping they used forceful hand signals to express their agreement
They are right that something is wrong about our ystem
Around the world we have underutilized resources  people who want to work machines that lie idle buildings that are empty  and huge unmet needs fighting poverty promoting development and retrofitting the economy for global warming to name just a few
In America after more than seven million home foreclosures in recent years we have empty homes and homeless people
The protesters have been criticized for not having an agenda
But this misses the point of protest movements
They are an expression of frustration with the electoral process
They are an alarm
The antiglobalization protests in Seattle in  at what was supposed to be the inauguration of a new round of trade talks called attention to the failures of globalization and the international institutions and agreements that govern it
When the press looked into the protesters allegations they found that there was more than a grain of truth in them
The trade negotiations that followed were different  at least in principle they were supposed to be a development round to make up for some of the deficiencies highlighted by protesters  and the International Monetary Fund subsequently undertook significant reforms
So too in the US the civilrights protesters of the  called attention to pervasive institutionalized racism in American society
That legacy has not yet been overcome but the election of President Barack Obama shows how far those protests moved America
On one level today protesters are asking for little a chance to use their skills the right to decent work at decent pay a fairer economy and society
Their hope is evolutionary not revolutionary
But on another level they are asking for a great deal a democracy where people not dollars matter and a market economy that delivers on what it is supposed to do
The two are related as we have seen unfettered markets lead to economic and political crises
Markets work the way they should only when they operate within a framework of appropriate government regulations and that framework can be erected only in a democracy that reflects the general interest  not the interests of the 
The best government that money can buy is no longer good enough
The Globalization of Science
SAN FRANCISCO  Science provides an invaluable source of guidance to individuals and governments
This is true in part because scientists can often predict the future consequences of current actions 
For example we know that someone who smokes two packs of cigarettes a day is likely to have a serious problem with cancer some  years later
And science predicts that unless we severely constrain consumption of oil and coal around the world the climate will continue to warm increasing ocean volume and melting huge amounts of ice in the Arctic and Antarctic  thereby causing disastrous rises in sea level
These are but two examples of thousands of instances in which it makes good sense for decisionmakers to take into account what science can predict about the future
And yet what science knows is far too often overlooked when highstakes decisions are made
This is not to say that scientists should dominate the government decisionmaking process
It is the business of politicians not scientists to consider the relative costs and benefits of the options before them weighing them as they see fit in reaching their conclusions
But many such judgments will be poor ones without effective scientific input
For example the United States government is wellserved by an organization called the National Academies based on three honorary organizations composed of the nation most distinguished scientists engineers and health professionals the National Academy of Sciences National Academy of Engineering and Institute of Medicine respectively
This independent nongovernmental organization produces more than  reports a year most in response to specific requests from the US government
These requests range from questions about the health hazards of trace amounts of arsenic in drinking water to questions about how best to support various forms of scientific research
Through a rigorous review process the Academies insist that each report be limited to what science can say about the subject based on evidence and logic without preempting the decisions that need to be made by others
Thus for example the report on drinking water predicted the frequency of bladder cancers that would eventually occur in a population exposed to levels of five  or  parts per billion of arsenic
But it did not say what maximum arsenic concentration the government should legislate
The full text of some  reports by the Academies are available online at 
 wwwnapedu
  and each can be downloaded for free in any of  countries
The dangers of arsenic are the same across the globe and in this case a USbased report can help all nations
However there are other important sciencebased issues that require study by internationallybased organizations in order to be widely accepted
To meet this need the InterAcademy Council IAC in Amsterdam was founded in  by a worldwide organization of science academies called the InterAcademy Panel IAP
The IAC is governed by a Board that includes a rotating group of  Academy presidents from around the world representing nations at a range of economic development levels and its reports present a truly international perspective backed by the world best scientists and engineers
The IAC provides advice on subjects requested by the United Nations and other international organizations all of which is freely available at 
 wwwinteracademycouncilnet
 
The first IAC report was entitled 
 Inventing a Better Future A Strategy for Building Worldwide Capacities in Science and Technology
 
It argued convincingly for the importance of supporting science and technology institutions in every nation that focus on harnessing the increasing store of international scientific and technical knowledge to meet that nation needs
Inventing a Better Future
 also provided detailed guidance to governments and international organizations on how to build institutional capacities for science and technology in both developing and industrialized countries
The IAC most recent effort entitled
 Lighting the Way Toward a Sustainable Energy Future
 presents an ambitious sciencebased agenda for meeting the world enormously challenging energy requirements
An important audience for each IAC report are the  academies of science that belong to the IAP Each has a special responsibility for disseminating a report recommendations throughout its own country which can considerably enhance the academy effectiveness in influencing national policies
The combination of the IAP and the IAC is an important new experiment for providing international scientific advice  an experiment that has only just begun to demonstrate its potential effectiveness for spreading the benefits of science and technology to all humanity
The God of Suffering
PRINCETON  Do we live in a world that was created by a god who is allpowerful allknowing and all good
Christians think we do
Yet a powerful reason for doubting this confronts us every day the world contains a vast amount of pain and suffering
If God is allknowing he knows how much suffering there is
If he is allpowerful he could have created a world without so much of it  and he would have done so if he were all good
Christians usually respond that God bestowed on us the gift of free will and hence is not responsible for the evil we do
But this reply fails to deal with the suffering of those who drown in floods are burned alive in forest fires caused by lightning or die of hunger or thirst during a drought
Christians sometimes attempt to explain this suffering by saying that all humans are sinners and so deserve their fate even if it is a horrible one
But infants and small children are just as likely to suffer and die in natural disasters as adults and it seems impossible that they could deserve to suffer and die
Once again some Christians say that we have all inherited the original sin committed by Eve who defied God decree against eating from the tree of knowledge
This is a triply repellant idea for it implies that knowledge is bad disobeying God will is the greatest sin of all and children inherit the sins of their ancestors and may justly be punished for them
Even if we were to accept all this the problem remains unresolved
For animals also suffer from floods fires and droughts and since they are not descended from Adam and Eve they cannot have inherited original sin
In earlier times when original sin was taken more seriously than it generally is today the suffering of animals posed a particularly difficult problem for thoughtful Christians
The seventeenthcentury French philosopher Ren Descartes solved it by the drastic expedient of denying that animals can suffer
Animals he maintained are merely ingenious mechanisms and we should not take their cries and struggles as a sign of pain any more than we take the sound of an alarm clock as a sign that it has consciousness
People who live with a dog or a cat are not likely to find that persuasive
Last month at Biola University a Christian college in southern California I debated the existence of God with the conservative commentator Dinesh Douza
In recent months Douza has made a point of debating prominent atheists but he too struggled to find a convincing answer to the problem I outlined above
He first said that because humans can live forever in heaven the suffering of this world is less important than it would be if our life in this world were the only life we had
That still fails to explain why an allpowerful and allgood god would permit it
Relatively insignificant as this suffering may be from the perspective of eternity the world would be better without it or at least without most of it
Some say that we need to have some suffering to appreciate what it is like to be happy
Maybe but we surely don need as much as we have
Next Douza argued that since God gave us life we are not in a position to complain if our life is not perfect
He used the example of a child born with one limb missing
If life itself is a gift he said we are not wronged by being given less than we might want
In response I pointed out that we condemn mothers who cause harm to their babies by using alcohol or cocaine when pregnant
Yet since they have given life to their children it seems that on Douza view there is nothing wrong with what they have done
Finally Douza fell back as many Christians do when pressed on the claim that we should not expect to understand God reasons for creating the world as it is
It is as if an ant should try to understand our decisions so puny is our intelligence in comparison with the infinite wisdom of God
This is the answer given in more poetic form in The Book of Job 
But once we abdicate our powers of reason in this way we may as well believe anything at all
Moreover the assertion that our intelligence is puny in comparison with God presupposes just the point that is under debate  that there is a god who is allknowing allpowerful and all good
The evidence of our own eyes makes it more plausible to believe that the world was not created by any god at all
If however we insist on believing in divine creation we are forced to admit that the god who made the world cannot be allpowerful and all good
He must be either evil or a bungler
The Gold Bubble and the Gold Bugs
NEW YORK  Gold prices have been rising sharply breaching the  barrier and in recent weeks rising towards  an ounce and above
Today old bugs argue that the price could top 
But the recent price surge looks suspiciously like a bubble with the increase only partly justified by economic fundamentals
Gold prices rise sharply only in two situations when inflation is high and rising gold becomes a hedge against inflation and when there is a risk of a near depression and investors fear for the security of their bank deposits gold becomes a safe haven
The last two years fit this pattern
Gold prices started to rise sharply in the first half of  when emerging markets were overheating commodity prices were rising and there was concern about rising inflation in highgrowth emerging markets
Even that rise was partly a bubble which collapsed in the second half of  when  after oil reached  killing global growth he world economy fell into recession
As concerns about deflation replaced fear of inflation gold prices started to fall with the correction in commodity prices
The second price spike occurred when Lehman Brothers collapsed leaving investors scared about the safety of their financial assets  including bank deposits
That scare was contained when the G committed to increase guarantees of bank deposits and to backstop the financial system
With panic subsiding towards the end of  gold prices resumed their downward movement
By that time with the global economy spinning into neardepression commercial and industrial gold use and even luxury demand took a further dive
Gold rose above  again in FebruaryMarch  when it looked like most of the financial system in the United States and Europe might be near insolvency and that many governments could not guarantee deposits and backstop the financial system because banks that were too big to fail were also too big to be saved
That panic subsided  and gold prices started to drift down again  after US banks were subjected to tress tests America Troubled Asset Relief Program further backstopped the financial system by removing bad assets from banks balance sheets and the global economy gradually bottomed out
So with no nearterm risk of inflation or depression why have gold prices started to rise sharply again in the last few months
There are several reasons why gold prices are rising but they suggest a gradual rise with significant risks of a downward correction rather than a rapid rise towards  as today gold bugs claim
First while we are still in a world of global deflation large monetized fiscal deficits are fueling concerns over mediumterm inflation
Second a massive wave of liquidity via easy monetary policy is chasing assets including commodities which may eventually stoke inflation further
Third dollarfunded carry trades are pushing the US dollar sharply down and there is an inverse relation between the value of the dollar and the dollar price of commodities the lower the dollar the higher the dollar price of oil energy and other commodities  including gold
Fourth the global supply of gold  both existing and newly produced  is limited and demand is rising faster than it can be met
Some of this demand is coming from central banks such as those of India China and South Korea
And some of it is coming from private investors who are using gold as a hedge against what remain lowprobability ail risks high inflation and another neardepression caused by a doubledip recession
Indeed investors increasingly want to hedge against such risks early on
Given the inelastic supply of gold even a small shift in the portfolios of central banks and private investors towards gold increases its price significantly
Finally sovereign risk is rising  consider the troubles faced by investors in Dubai Greece and other emerging markets and advanced economies
This has revived concerns that governments may be unable to backstop a toobigtosave financial system
But since gold has no intrinsic value there are significant risks of a downward correction
Eventually central banks will need to exit quantitative easing and zerointerest rates putting downward pressure on risky assets including commodities
Or the global recovery may turn out to be fragile and anemic leading to a rise in bearish sentiment on commodities  and in bullishness about the US dollar
Another downside risk is that the dollarfunded carry trade may unravel crashing the global asset bubble that it together with the wave of monetary liquidity has caused
And since the carry trade and the wave of liquidity are causing a global asset bubble some of gold recent rise is also bubbledriven with herding behavior and omentum trading by investors pushing gold higher and higher
But all bubbles eventually burst
The bigger the bubble the greater the collapse
The recent rise in gold prices is only partially justified by fundamentals
Nor is it clear why investors should stock up on gold if the global economy dips into recession again and concerns about a near depression and rampant deflation rise sharply
If you truly fear a global economic meltdown you should stock up on guns canned food and other commodities that you can actually use in your log cabin
The Golden Haves
CAMBRIDGE  Lately I have been trying to explain to my elevenyearold son Gabriel the astronomical differences between people income
Microsoft founder Bill Gates first penetrated Gabriel consciousness a couple of years ago when his father served as a warmup act to Gates at a large conference sponsored by the Danish government
Ever since Gabriel has been fascinated by the seemingly infinite possibilities of having  billion
For example whenever I tell Gabriel that something is unbelievably valuable even say a great painting in a museum he invariably says ut Bill Gates could buy it right
Yes Gates could buy the whole museum
But then he would just turn around and give it back so everyone else can see it so there is no point
Gabriel is not entirely convinced
Gabriel has decided that if he can become a professional basketball player when he grows up then he like to buy a team
As an economics professor I cannot help but ask him if he knows that it costs  million to buy a National Basketball Association team
ut Bill Gates could do it
He could buy all the teams in the league right
Yes I say
But if Bill Gates were to own the entire NBA how would he decide which team to root for
Gabriel concedes the point but I can tell that again he is not convinced
Gates is not the only one who can easily buy teams and paintings
The latest Forbes list of America wealthiest individuals showed that last year highest nine earners whose ranks include New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg managed to increase their wealth by  billion last year
Yes that is just the annual increase in their wealth
Collectively their  billion in earnings outstripped the entire national income of more than  countries
To put these astronomical numbers in perspective I had Gabriel try to confirm that to be among the top nine earners in the United States you had to pull in at least  per second  including time spent eating and sleeping
That is  per minute or  per hour
How much do America highest income earners make compared to the world billion poorest individuals
Well if the top nine donated their earnings it would be the equivalent of about three months income for the bottom billion
Gabriel knows of course that Bill Gates and Warren Buffet have donated tens of billions already
As for the other nine months given that the US accounts for only  of world income it is a fair guess that there are some very wealthy individuals elsewhere who might be able to kick in
Mexican telephone magnate Carlos Slim for example is a close competitor to Gates for the title of the world richest man
Mind you the idea that the ultrarich could easily solve poverty is stupefyingly nave
Most serious academic research strongly supports the view that rich countries can best help poor regions like Africa by opening their markets and by providing assistance in building physical and institutional infrastructure
The greatest successes in fighting global poverty have come from China and India two countries that have largely pulled themselves up by their own bootstraps
But this seems too complicated to explain to Gabriel just yet
So I retreat to the simplistic rock starUnited Nations view of how great it would be if we could give more money
Are massive income and wealth differences an inevitable outcome of fast growth
By and large the answer from history is es
China whose growth performance since  has now broken every record is well on its way to having the world most unequal income distribution
Indeed China has passed the US and is nearing Latin American levels of inequality
Policy solutions are not easy
Many superearners are also supercreative and bring enormous value
Places like the United Kingdom actively court wealthy foreign nationals through extraordinary preferential treatment of their investment income
The ultrarich are an ultramobile group too
If you are earning  an hour it does not take too long to save up to buy an apartment even in London
Anyway there are limits to how much tax pressure the political system can apply to the ultrarich
Consider that any of the top nine American earners make more in two days than leading US Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton raises for her campaign in a good quarter of the year
Rather than punitively taxing wealth globalization strengthens the case for shifting to a flat tax on income or better yet consumption with a moderately high exemption
Aside from the usual efficiency arguments it is just going to become increasingly difficult and costly to maintain complex and idiosyncratic national tax arrangements
Unfortunately movements towards fundamental tax reform are on the back burner in most countries
One can only hope that our children generation will grow up to live in a world that does a better job of balancing efficiency and equity than we do
Gabriel says he is going to think about it
The Goldstone Reversal
NEW YORK  Justice Richard Goldstone was condemned by many apologists for Israel humanrights record for his conclusion that Israel intentionally targeted Palestinian civilians as a matter of policy during the  Gaza war
Goldstone United Nationsbacked report accused both Israelis and Palestinians of war crimes and called on both sides to investigate prosecute and punish their own personnel
The Israeli government reacted furiously to Goldstone efforts
Now he is being condemned by some critics of Israel human rights record for retracting his finding of intentionality
The controversy illustrates the care that is required in publishing humanrights reports
What is not in dispute about the oldstone Report is the factfinding on which its conclusions are based
In difficult circumstances and with no cooperation from the Israeli government Goldstone documented in substantial detail a large number of Israeli attacks that killed many hundreds of civilians injured thousands and destroyed a significant part of Gaza civilian infrastructure
Goldstone also documented attacks against Israeli civilians by Hamas and did not restrict himself to a discussion of the notorious rockets indiscriminately fired from Gaza
Goldstone included in his report a detailed discussion of Hamas seizure of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit and its refusal even to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to see him
It is extremely difficult to prove a policy of intentionality when conducting human rights investigations
That is why Human Rights Watch which covered much of the same ground as Goldstone in its own reporting on Gaza  and was also vigorously denounced by apologists for Israeli human rights abuses  did not reach such a conclusion
But that does not make it wrong for a seasoned investigator like Goldstone reviewing the evidence that he collected to infer intentionality from the pattern and quantity of abuses
In certain cases the evidence requires a judgment on such a question
The original Goldstone Report could have limited its conclusory judgment to an assertion that Israel did not meet its obligation under the international laws of armed conflict to take all feasible measures to minimize harm to civilians
Yet because Goldstone went further and found a policy of intentionality before revising that judgment he should have insisted on additional evidence that his finding was not warranted
Instead Goldstone says that his revised judgment is based on the fact that srael has dedicated significant resources to investigate over  allegations of operational misconduct in Gaza
That sounds impressive
Yet to my knowledge none of those investigations so far has resulted in the criminal prosecution and punishment of any Israeli soldier or official for a humanrights abuse committed against a civilian in Gaza
Only three have resulted in indictments
Moreover there is no indication that any of the Israeli investigations address questions of policy
In other words Goldstone retraction is either not warranted by the evidence on which he says that he now relies or it is premature
At the very least it alleviates much of the pressure on the Israeli authorities to go forward with goodfaith prosecutions
It would have been better to wait for the outcome of the Israeli authorities investigations
The most important part of humanrights reporting is collecting the facts of abuses accurately
This must be done fairly so that disproportionate focus on one side abuses does not create distortions
And it must be done as quickly as is consistent with accuracy and fairness so that the information can be used effectively to help prevent additional abuses
In withdrawing his conclusion that there was a policy of intentional targeting of civilians by Israel Goldstone has not said that his judgment based on the evidence before him at the time was wrong
Rather he has said that subsequent investigations by the Israeli authorities have made him change his judgment
The evidence available to him and to us about those investigations is clearly too paltry to warrant such a shift
In recanting on this basis Goldstone conveys to the Israelis that they can receive absolution from a highly respected voice of the international community by making a show of investigations
Yet his distinguished record in ensuring that humanrights abuses are reported fairly and accurately remains untarnished
The Good Fallout from Iraq
Reconciling morals with how a society is organized  in other words reconciling ethics with politics  is one of humanitys oldest ambitions
Hammurabi Raamses II Solon Confucius and Pericles were among the first great figures to embark on this effort
The emergence of the nationstate in the eighteenth century and the extreme level of barbarism reached in the twentieth century may have created the impression that an ethical politics was an unrealizable dream or that it was a dream growing ever more distant as it receded into the future
Yet despite the rivalry of nations and the bloodiness of modern warfare democracy is spreading
Indeed in but half a century Latin Americans rid themselves of all of that continents military and civilian dictatorships and Africa has eliminated more than half of the despots that have blighted its era of independence
Compared with all the other political regimes known to mankind democracy represents ethical progress twice over first because it is based on respect for human rights and secondly because the universal suffrage that modern democracy embraces prohibits neglecting or oppressing minorities
Of course progress towards more democracy and morality in international public affairs remains extremely slow
Yet the year  may leave to history some of the greatest progress in this area that humanity has seen
Signs of hope and progress abound
A Spanish government was overthrown because it lied to its public about the origin of the terrorist bombs that ripped apart Madrids train station last spring
Tony Blair and George W Bush are having huge problems with their electorates also because they lied about the reasons they gave to justify their war in Iraq
Democracy is alive and well in the developing world too
The electoral process in Indonesia is reaching a level of equity and accountability hitherto unknown in that country
Morocco and Algeria are working to strengthen womens rights
Turkey has committed itself to a vast legislative effort to improve human rights freedom of thought treatment of prisoners and civilian control over the military
Even China though highly insensitive to democratic principles is discovering with the dangerous spread of AIDS an obligation to listen to popular clamor and the need for public support to justify government actions
The US owing to its horrific treatment and torture of prisoners in Baghdad has had no option but to search for international legitimacy after denying and defying it for so long in order to extricate itself from the chaos and drama of what is now Iraq
Israel has seen both the legitimacy of its security wall as well as the walls proposed path through Palestinian territory called into question  differently but in a parallel manner  by both its own Supreme Court and by the International Court of Justice in The Hague
Israel will not be able to ignore completely the rulings of either court
In replacing the Organization of African Unity with the African Union Africa for its part is making a huge effort to control conflict on the continent as well as to spread observance of human rights and pursue the struggle against poverty
Moreover capitalism itself is feeling pressure in every direction
It sees ever increasing anger against bloated payments to bosses risky speculation and outright fraud
The creation of the International Criminal Court strengthens all of these efforts to bring abuses of power by the powerful to book
So despite the Iraq war and the seeming impotence of world institutions the beginning of the twentyfirst century could well bring faster global improvement in political ethics than at any time in the past
But for this trend to truly take hold good politics needs something more than morals alone
States must begin to explain their toughest actions those deeds that the search for security and the inevitable mistrust among states make necessary
Reason of State will not disappear entirely
But for democracy to continue its march of ethical progress reasons of state must be submitted to greater public accountability and justification
The Good Fight against Malaria
LONDON  The tsunami in Japan the earthquake in Haiti and Hurricane Katrina are among the world most notorious recent natural disasters
Their fierce devastation claimed thousands of lives destroyed vital infrastructure and crippled economies
The communities affected could not be more different from one another and yet the similarities in the responses are striking
The worldwide outpouring of support demonstrated what humanity is capable of at its best
While international support in a time of crisis demonstrates a seemingly innate moral response to the suffering of others it also highlights with disquieting clarity that the same level of empathy is more difficult to evoke when a crisis is chronic instead of sudden unexpected and dramatic
One of the most devastating global health challenges on the planet is malaria which claims more than  lives annually primarily among young African children
According to the Roll Back Malaria Partnership  children die of the disease each day
Yet unlike the aftermath of a natural disaster there are no photographs to capture the scope of this tragedy
The loss of life is every bit as devastating but without the onslaught of grisly images it is much easier to become indifferent to malaria victims
Malaria deaths represent nothing less than a moral issue
This is why the United Nations World Bank Global Fund Tony Blair Faith Foundation African heads of state and many other governments organizations and individuals have felt compelled to act
In  United Nations SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon declared the goal of ensuring universal access to malariacontrol interventions by the end of  for all those at risk of the disease with the ultimate goal of reaching nearzero malaria deaths by 
Since those goals were set major progress has been made
Hundreds of thousands of lives have been saved and the international community now is redoubling its efforts to reach the  milestone
Three years ago when more than  billion in new money was committed to the malaria effort mosquito nets and indoor spraying protected less than  of Africa atrisk population
Today the proportion is more than 
These gains occurred only because of the commitment of leaders agencies and individuals who realized that lessening the malaria burden is not only an opportunity but also a responsibility
No organization better embodies the moral imperative of ending malaria deaths than the African Leaders Malaria Alliance ALMA
Formed during the UN General Assembly in September  under the leadership of President Jakaya Kikwete of Tanzania and supported by the African Union the group has added government advocacy and accountability to the combined efforts being made to halt and reverse the spread of malaria on the continent
Recognizing that the death of a child from a mosquito bite is unacceptable in the twentyfirst century ALMA leaders understand that the most effective way to ensure that recent gains are sustained is to assume leadership and ownership of the challenge
They are taking concrete actions such as ensuring that essential malariacontrol interventions are exempted from taxes and tariffs that add unnecessary costs to lifesaving items and that supplies are purchased in bulk to reduce costs
Most powerful of all perhaps is an innovative corecard which is being prepared to track progress in the struggle to end malaria deaths and to lag problems that arise before they reach a critical stage
The scorecard will be open and accessible to all
While African political leaders have ultimate responsibility for protecting their citizens faith communities share deeply in this commitment
The Tony Blair Faith Foundation is conducting a global campaign Faiths Act which calls for greater engagement by faith communities in preventing malaria deaths
Supporters of every religion in  countries have answered the call
Though accurate statistics are hard to come by the World Health Organization estimates that faith communities provide on average  of total healthcare services in subSaharan Africa
What faith communities have working in their favor are networks infrastructure and influential leaders to deliver health messages
In many instances they can reach deep into inaccessible rural areas to deliver services
When well resourced faith leaders can adopt holistic approaches to major killer diseases and use their networks effectively for immunization and combating pandemics
In Nigeria which accounts for onequarter of the continent malaria deaths the Nigerian InterFaith Action Association has been particularly effective in training religious leaders for health messaging against malaria and in the correct use of bed nets
This initiative has received the backing of the Sultan of Sokoto Sad Abubakar III the country leading Muslim and the Catholic Archbishop of Abuja John Oneiyekan
There is a fulltime centrally organized office and team to coordinate this program
If it succeeds the impact will be dramatic  and not just in Nigeria
For example Sierra Leone with its small population excellent MuslimChristian relations and uphill struggle to improve its healthcare system after the depredations of civil war has a longstanding relationship with the United Kingdom
The Tony Blair Faith Foundation has been in consultation with the country religious leaders and interfaith association to develop a national program with the Ministry of Health that would promote the government key publichealth messages participate in education for bednet use and use available health assets and faith community networks
Now is no time for indifference
Much significant progress has already been made now we must consolidate our gains
As foreign aid stands to suffer from cutbacks around the world we must remember that malaria is a atural disaster that is devastating communities every second of every day
Earthquakes tsunamis and hurricanes can never be stopped
Malaria can be
The Good Times Might Never Come
In a BBC interview last week Paul Krugman said  full employment economy is by far the best environment in which to make structural adjustment you can see that historically
It a claim that fails the tests of theory and evidence
In the lexicon of international organizations the term structural adjustment describes a mix of regulatory and economic reforms intended to restore the sustainability of marketoriented economic growth after onset of crisis
Adjustment includes measures to restore balance of payments promote exports macroeconomic stabilization public debt and budget deficit reduction elimination of wage and price distortions privatization and the relevant institutional reforms of law and regulation the sequence is disputed
I want to discuss the reasons for the flaw in the implied ideal Krugman sequence Economic recovery or just jobs first structural adjustment second
Countries can and should delay difficult reforms at least until exit from crisis is well underway
The prestigious indow of opportunity alternative to Krugman
The Nobel Laureate economist historian Douglass North finds that though the best kinds of historical change are seen in retrospect to have been slow and incremental as culture and norms evolve economic and political crises repeatedly supplied the discontinuous indows of opportunity for the emergence and transformation of formal organizations
The political scientist Francis Fukuyama similarly notes that the emand for institutional change is usually the product of crisis or extraordinary circumstances that create no more than a brief window for reform
Fukuyama observes that during the Latin American debt crises of the s countries being rescued by international organizations
ere advised to move as rapidly as possible toward structural adjustment on the grounds that the political window for engagement in this kind of reform would close quickly and that it was better to get the pain of adjustment over with all at once
Two classic views of the function of crisis in change
The foremost American sociologist of the twentieth century Talcott Parsons had no doubt that change relates to the disequilibrium in causal ways train always sets up reequilibrating processes
Changes in a society destiny ave often been attended with severe dislocations of the previous social organisation
Again he increase of strains in one strategic area of social structure are finally resolved by a structural reorganisation of the system
Parsons explained change partly in terms of the struggles between vested interests which are inevitable when a system is reorganized
The economist most frequently mentioned in this blog Joseph Schumpeter could not conceive of economic progress in the absence of crisis
Recurrence of crisis is integral to cycles of innovation and growth tabilized capitalism is a contradiction in terms
He tresses discontinuity and the ind of economic change that is likely to break up the existing patterns creating new positions of power civilisations valuations beliefs and policies
Sometimes politics is the external disturbance to which the economy must adapt
Much more common however is nstitutional lag the tendency for the economy to run ahead of institutional capacity
Societies prosper only if their institutions catchup with the economic dynamic
Almost always crisis is the signal for this to happen urgently
Late twentiethcentury structural adjustments
A wellregarded comparative study of structural adjustment reforms in Asia Africa and Latin America by Merilee Grindle and John Thomas found that if there is no crisis the stakes will be low the consequences of failing to implement reforms will not be severe and policymakers lean towards incremental or marginal change
During politicsasusual decisions typically revolve on organisational issues bureaucratic politics and building coalitions
Policy elites may be preoccupied with satisfying interest groups or networks
The authors find that during a crisis policy elites come under pressure to reform with urgency
They are more innovative and take bigger risks
Major issues of legitimacy and social stability come to the fore
Reformers are more likely to undertake radical change
In fact reformers might manufacturenbspthe perception of crisis to get policies onto the political agenda
In crises policy elites can be expected to have more autonomy to set agendas
In crises politicians and citizens are more willing to allow technocrats wideranging powers that insulate them from political pressure
Crises at the same time often disorganize and weaken interest groups that would otherwise resist reforms
In different parts of the world since the s the combination of statist or populist policy failures and international shocks produced economic chaos recession hyperinflation and debt crises
According to Stephan Haggard and Robert R Kaufman the response to crisis was consequently usually  profound shift in development strategy away from stateled inwardoriented models of growth toward emphasis on the market private ownership and greater openness to trade and foreign investment
In general they find that crises were often decisive in a change of political regime for vercoming policy stalemates
In an important comparative study of twentyone developing countries Deepak Lal and Hla Myint argue that neoliberal economic reforms attempt to restore order to economies and political systems that were made unmanageable by populist and statist economic policies when nly a crisis can resolve the esulting paralysis of the polity and economy
Stephan Haggard analysis of the Asian financial crisis  offers other examples of reform driven by exigencies of crisis
The IMF and governments such as Indonesia aw in the crisis an opportunity to press forward with reforms they had sought for some time
Taiwan for example eized the opportunity to strengthen the regulatory framework
Deeper analyses of twentiethcentury adjustments
One of the pioneers of development economics Albert Hirschman had a theory that development practitioners learn the arts of policy making and become effective by coping with disequilibria and embracing isproportionalities in messy processes
Decision makers develop competency for understanding and modifying the means and ends of policy better when they work in a pressured hothouse environment forcing them to cope with tensions bottlenecks shortages and instability
Societies move forward said Hirschman by ailing against the wind
A perturbation of status quo induces disequilibrium learning
We like to think political leaders should undertake comprehensive reforms without the turbulence uncertainty and forced experimentation that arises as a survival mechanism during economic crisis
In fact crises can eliminate political obstacles and provide the pressured cognitive environment conducive to better understanding of problems and solutions
A crisis is the legitimate incentive for decisiveness in the short run
It can make all the difference between incremental politicsasusual and radical discontinuous reform
Good political leadership is vital
Arnold Harberger a Chicago economist who advised several Latin American governments during the s debt crises pointed out the catalytic role of  handful of heroes
But for the efforts of educated energetic technocrats with will vision and power to break the historical mould positive olicy would in all likelihood have failed or never got started
The intensity of crisis was the factor determining the contribution of these leaders and the levels of risk they were prepared to run
t was no accident that waves of modernisation and liberalisation in Argentina Bolivia Brazil Chile Peru and many other countries were concentrated in periods of crisis
Later when the crisis was past additional steps in the reform process came slower and with more difficulty in the face of popular indifference bureaucratic inertia and political resistance and manoeuvring
Some related considerations
As Paul Krugman well knows it helps to have an ideology lying around ready to put into action at moments of crisis when disequilibriating forces create strong incentives for change
On the eve of the explosion of the debt crises of the s Milton Friedman offered a timely and categorical observation on the interplay of crisis change and ideas
here is enormous inertia  a tyranny of the status quo  in private and especially governmental arrangements
Only a crisis  actual or perceived  produces real change
When that crisis occurs the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around
That I believe is our basic function to develop alternatives to existing policies to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable
A similar point was made in a different way by Max Weber one hundred years ago
His emphasis was on the legal reforms that need to occur periodically for capitalism to regain momentum
Scholars may know them in theory
They may already have been nvented
But they don get realized and implemented until economic conditions call out for them
ike the technological methods of industry the rational patterns of legal technique must first be nvented before they can serve an existing economic interest
Hence the specific type of techniques used in a legal system are of far greater significance for the likelihood that a certain legal institution will be invented in its context than is ordinarily believed
Economic situations do not automatically give birth to new legal forms they merely provide the opportunity for the actual spread of a legal technique if it is invented
Today we are in a time characterized by debt crises in the advanced economies
Causes of twentyfirst century advanced country crises are similar to the causes of late twentieth century crises in developing countries
The overarching problem of several advanced countries is their assive debt overhang
Reducing the overhang is going to be painful
It means readjusting the mix of economic and institutional structure so as to restore economic dynamism
Healthy systems respond to strain through adaptation
The quality of policy is conditioned by awareness of strain
Crises generate the atmosphere for policy innovations
The takeaway
Structural adjustment is highly unlikely to occur without a crisis
Furthermore getting out of crisis almost certainly requires structural adjustment
Even if the economist simulation models can show monetary and fiscal policy might restore employment without structural adjustment the probability of avoiding repeat crises in the near term will still be zero
Delaying structural adjustment when the opportunity for it is given by the intensity of crisis is the sure recipe for repeating cycles of useless and debilitating crises
In their book This Time is Different Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff said The most expensive investment advice ever given in the boom just before a financial crisis stems from the perception that this time is different  Each time society convinces itself that the current boom unlike the many booms that preceded catastrophic collapses in the past is built on sound fundamentals structural reforms technological innovation good policy
The error is replicated during the crisis if belief takes hold that structural reform can be left until the economy has recovered its strength because this time is different
There are all kinds of tempting delusions
The evidence about past crises is reinterpreted in more optimistic form
The models of the multipliers are more accurate now
The country is fundamentally richer and can afford not to change
The new financial technologies are efficient
We trust this set of politicians to do the reforms once the emergency is over
No
As always the crisis will be the only opportunity for economic and institutional restructuring that is the precondition for a new pattern of growth
The Google that Can Say No
NEW YORK  Usually disclosure statements go at the end of an article but let me start with mine
I sit on the board of Yandex a Russian search company with a roughly  market share in Russia compared to Google  or so
I am also an investor in and advisor to AnchorFree the company that offers Hotspot Shield a publicly accessible virtual private network VPN that allows users to keep their browsing private whether they are concerned about thieves stealing their banking details or about governments monitoring where they surf
We have about one million users monthly in China out of seven million worldwide
And I sit on the board of andMe a company cofounded by the wife of Sergey Brin the cofounder of Google
So I have a variety of interests in the topic of Google recent moves in China
In the beginning I supported Google presence in China
My fundamental belief is that every time a user gets information it reinforces a little part of the brain that says t good to know things
It my right to have information whether it about train schedules movie stars or the activities of the politicians who make decisions that affect my life
If you can ask questions about some things but not about others eventually you start to wonder about that fact itself
Google and my hopes that it could help liberate China look a little nave now
Of course censorship is not a big secret in China
China employs approximately  people as censors
They have names and faces and they may negotiate with a publisher about a particularly sensitive topic
They are less likely to negotiate with bloggers because there are so many bloggers but the government reportedly does train bloggers in how to post in support of government policy and if you are lucky you can get a job reportedly at  per post doing the government bidding
So why has Google made a fuss and threatened to walk out of China
The answer probably stems from a combination of  or rather a changing calculus around  business interests and values
The censorship issue has long grated at Google Brin with his Russian background is reported to be especially hostile to censorship but the company could argue that transparency about censorship was better than not serving China at all
The censorship however has been getting worse
Perhaps the initial argument was wrong Exposing Chinese censorship has done little to reduce it
Many Chinese support government censorship They see it as a way to maintain civility and order
They know that their government is fragile and they consider criticism harmful rather than cleansing
They trust their government to deal with problems over time
At the same time while China represents a huge market in the everreceding future it has not been an especially lucrative market for Google so far
Baidu the indigenous Chinese rival to Google benefits in many ways both from government support and from hometeam nationalism among users
More generally China probably looks less appealing to investors now than it did a few years ago not so much because of the Chinese economy as a whole but because of constraints on the ability of any foreign entity to make serious longterm profits
This growing disillusion was already present when a wave of cyberattacks on Google and other companies forced the company to reassess its entire China strategy
There are certainly other ways that Google could have handled the issue  for example by capitulating to the Chinese government various requests
That would certainly not have comported with Google public values  and it would probably have been a bad business decision as well
When you go into a situation like this  whether joining a board or entering a market  you always have one option left which is to walk away
If you cannot do that you have no negotiating power
But if you do have that option you must be ready to exercise it
That is what Google has done in China  where its move is irrevocable
The company can go back to the old situation
Nor is China likely to say e weren hacking yound we promise never to do it again
So while Google is unlikely to reenter China for the foreseeable future the company has improved its negotiating position in whatever other disputes it might have in the future
And it has won support from the US government
What can Google do now
My friends at AnchorFree want Google to support Hotspot Shield in some form or other although Google exit from China might be support enough
Hotspot Shield is one of the best ways of caling the wall to peer outside the lockeddown Chinese Internet and use sites such as Twitter Facebook and of course Googlecom as opposed to Googlecn 
Like Google in the past AnchorFree may operate more effectively by being discreet without loud support from Google or other oreign interests
Its Web site is often blocked in countries such as China and many in the Middle East but there are usually other ways to obtain the software
Google too may be blocked but there are ways to get to it for those who are determined  The next steps are up to the Chinese users themselves
In the end China knows that it can make the Internet airtight
So someone in the Chinese government is probably having regrets
It tempting to predict how this will end
But I think it won end
As within Google so within China decisions are made but not everyone agrees with them
There a conflict between business interests and moral values  The tugofwar will continue for the foreseeable future  But in this little battle of a long war transparency has won a victory
The Gospel According to Gates
Bill Gates and Warren Buffett the richest and second richest person in America and perhaps the world are often described as admirers of Andrew Carnegie famous  essay he Gospel of Wealth
Carnegie treatise an American classic provides a moral justification for the concentration of wealth that capitalism tends to create by arguing that immense wealth leads to wellspent charitable contributions and support of the arts and sciences
In short Carnegie thought that great personal wealth leads to great civilizations
he Gospel of Wealth is based on the premise that business competition results in urvival of the fittest  the fittest being those endowed with the most alent for organization
Carnegie argued that those who thrive in business and acquire huge personal fortunes are better at judging how the world really works and thus are better qualified to judge where resources should be directed
Successful people according to Carnegie should retire from business while they still retain those talents and devote their remaining years to spending their fortunes on philanthropy
Carnegie also advocated an inheritance tax as an incentive arguing that it would nduce the rich man to attend to the administration of wealth during his life
Encouraging the rich to spend their fortunes on good causes while still alive Carnegie maintained is far better than leaving the disposition of their wealth to the care of their probably untalented children
Last month Bill Gates announced that he will do what Carnegie recommended in two years he will change his priorities so that he can work full time for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation which he and his wife founded
Even earlier than Carnegie who quit at  Gates will devote his life to spending his huge fortune on philanthropy
Warren Buffett by contrast is  so he has missed his chance to apply his talents to running a charitable foundation
But by leaving the bulk of his fortune approximately  billion to the Gates Foundation he will have done the next best thing
Bill Gates is a controversial figure but few doubt that he is smart
Even so whereas Carnegie theory makes some sense which is why his essay is remembered so well more than a century later it isn obvious that he was right to believe that successful business people are the best administrators of charitable foundations
Useful traits in business like aggressiveness or political savvy might be poorly suited to philanthropy
Likewise running a foundation may well require studying social problems or the arts and sciences  activities that may not accord with former capitalists inclinations and talents
The deeper flaw in Carnegie theory may be that it is just too difficult psychologically for business people to make the midlife career transition to philanthropy
Having accumulated great wealth as urvivors of the business world will they really turn their talents to the task of giving it away
Regardless of whether Gates lives up to his promise are people like him the exception that proves the rule
It is easy to be skeptical that his example will spur a new wave of early retirements to run philanthropies
The publicspirited justification of the concentration of wealth offered in he Gospel of Wealth has more support in the United States than elsewhere which reflects Americans relatively greater admiration of business people
But Carnegie argument never became received doctrine even in America because most people reject the view that rich business people are smarter and morally superior
Certainly Gates and Buffett claim nothing of the sort
Similarly even in America movies and TV shows do not dramatize the lives of great tycoon philanthropists
Americans like everyone else prefer portrayals of business people who are truly evil and in the end receive their just deserts
And yet there is more charitable giving in the US than in other countries reflecting a greater sense in America that private benevolence is an obligation
According to the Johns Hopkins University Comparative Nonprofit Sector Project headed by Lester Salamon the US leads major countries in private contributions to nonprofits
Excluding donations to churches such contributions amount to  of GDP in the US which is six times higher than in Germany or Japan and  times higher than in Mexico
However  of GDP is still not a very big number and the Gates Foundation with about  billion after Buffett bequest now accounts for a substantial share of the total
Of course Gates and Buffett deserve praise and we should certainly wish them well
But we should not yet consider their example a vindication of he Gospel of Wealth
The Gospel of Growth
CANBERRASEOUL  Almost four years after the start of the global financial crisis the world economy remains fragile and unemployment is unacceptably high
There are roughly  million unemployed people worldwide including nearly  million young people
Growth is weakening in many countries risks are mounting and uncertainty has intensified owing especially to events in Europe
Only swift and sustained recovery can stem the rise in the human cost of economic stagnation
When the G meets in Los Cabos Mexico onnbspJune  its challenge will be to shift public perceptions from pessimism and concern about the future to an optimistic mindset of growth and stability
We need resolute action to address the uncertainty confronting the global economy and to chart a path toward selfsustaining recovery and job creation
We see two components to such a strategy
First we need a clear message from Europe  the immediate source of global economic concern  that it is taking decisive steps to stabilize and strengthen its banks and that it is focused on restoring growth while credibly committing itself to fiscal consolidation
A crucial element of restoring confidence in Europe is agreement on a oadmap for the eurozone to underpin its monetary union with a fiscal union and a banking union including panEuropean supervision and deposit insurance
It is essential that Europe move quickly to ensure that its banks are adequately capitalized and backstopped
In this regard we welcome the recent decision by Spain to seek financial assistance from the European Union to recapitalize its banks as required
Decisive steps to safeguard the banking sector health are necessary not only to reduce some of the risks that are preoccupying markets but also because healthy financial institutions are vital for economic growth
Europe must have credible fiscalconsolidation plans to restore debt sustainability but it is also essential that it has a growth strategy that includes policies aimed at boosting investment freeing up product and labor markets deregulating business promoting competition and building skills
These reforms including deeper institutional integration will be politically difficult and their benefits will take time to become fully apparent but setting a clear pathway will underpin public confidence in Europe longterm growth and cooperation
We do not underestimate the magnitude of the reforms that Europe has achieved in recent years
Since the G meeting at Cannes last November for example Europe has increased its financial firewalls by  billion  billion restructured Greek debt taken steps towards strengthening its banks and banking regulations established rules for fiscal discipline and implemented a range of labor and productmarket reforms
But the magnitude of the challenges confronting Europe implies an urgent need for far more decisive reforms
We are confident that Europe will act together to meet these challenges and we will continue to support such efforts because European stability and growth matter for us all
Second we need a clear message from the G that all of its members are delivering policies for strong sustainable and balanced growth
To be meaningful the message must be backed up with action G members must demonstrate that their policies are clearly directed toward restoring economic growth and creating jobs and that they will be accountable for meeting their commitments in full
And world leaders must be unambiguous about resisting protectionism and opening trade and investment
In particular we believe that an international agreement on trade facilitation is the right step as it would reduce export and import costs and restore momentum to global trade liberalization
The G must demonstrate in Los Cabos that reform of the International Monetary Fund is continuing
That means that countries must deliver on their commitment to increase IMF resources by more than  billion and that the Fund quota and governance structure must reflect the ongoing global shifts in economic influence
Economic growth and new jobs are crucial to improving people livelihoods now and to ensuring the prosperity of future generations
The reforms needed to secure these objectives are not easy and change will not happen overnight
But the world expects the G to deliver
The Government Debt Bomb
STANFORD  As economies around the world return to growth after the deepest recession in a generation renewed attention is being paid to enormous fiscal deficits and vast expansions of government debt
This year projected deficits as a share of GDP are estimated to be a remarkable  for the United States twice the previous record at the depth of the horrific early  recession
Among other major economies the United Kingdom  France  India  Japan  Italy  Germany  China  and Canada 
In addition to the automatic decline in tax revenues and increase in socialwelfare spending during a recession many nations added large spending increases andor tax cuts to try to stimulate their economies
The increase in the deficit is the sum of these utomatic stabilizers and discretionary programs
The discretionary policy response has been largest in the US at a cumulative  of GDP and China at  over  while it has been modest in Germany and Canada and smaller in the UK France and India
The automatic increase in the deficit has also been largest in the US modest in the UK and Germany and smaller in Japan India Canada China France and Italy
These automatic effects should soon begin to reverse as economic activity recovers but there is much debate including at the G and G meetings over whether the discretionary stimulus should be extended or ended repeated or reversed
Since every dollar euro yen rupee or yuan borrowed today requires the same present value in future interest payments  and therefore future taxes  there are important longterm costs to balance against whatever benefits the deficits create today there is no fiscal free lunch
Some politicians for example President Barack Obama in the US herald their fiscal stimulus programs as effective responses to the economic crisis
They pledge allegiance to longterm fiscal responsibility yet propose budgets with large deficits for years to come and big hikes in the debtGDP ratio
Politicians from political parties out of power denounce the deficits and debt as a horrific legacy for our children and an insurmountable burden on the economy
In the US in the  Democrats excoriated President Ronald Reagan on deficits Republicans now excoriate President Obama on his much larger deficits and debt
Deficits are convenient for politicians as they hide and delay the true tax cost of spending
But when are deficits desirable and when are they damaging
The impact of the economy on the budget balance is swifter surer and larger than the impact of the budget balance on the economy
All economists agree that we should allow the automatic stabilizers to work
Discretionary fiscal policy is often clumsy in responding to recession given the usual lags in legislative and administrative implementation and the politics of pork and special interests surrounding spending and tax decisions
The current US stimulus has been much slower to enter the economy than promised
Indeed most of the stimulus money will be spent after the recession ppears to have ended and the evidence is that so far it has had little effect
It is appropriate to finance some longlived publiccapital investment by government borrowing since the benefits will accrue for many years and future taxpayers might equitably bear part of the burden
This is standard practice for US state and local governments
It is also more efficient to keep tax rates stable over time and thus to finance with debt temporary large spending needs such as military buildups during war or to prevent war while reversing the debt buildup thereafter
The US federal government borrowing exceeded tax revenues in every year since the end of World War II
Such debt finance is both equitable and efficient
But little in the current stimulus programs is justifiable on either of the grounds mentioned above
The level composition and growth of spending and taxes are the fundamental fiscal indicators
Even with a balanced budget there is still the issue of the effectiveness and efficiency of spending as each dollar of government revenue costs the economy about  given the distortions to private decisions caused by taxes
Large deficits shift the bill for today consumption to future generations and can crowd out private investment thereby slowing the improvement of living standards
Deficits are riskier if the level of the national debt the accumulation of all previous deficits is high or rapidly rising relative to GDP
The debtGDP ratio varies a lot by country
It will double in the US unless President Obama reverses course as President Bill Clinton did when he and a Republican Congress balanced the budget
Deficits are problematic if they finance consumption not productive public investment on infrastructure
The crisis funding of the modest delayed infrastructure component of most stimulus programs suggests that much of it would not pass a rigorous costbenefit test
Some US federal agencies are trying to spend ten times their previous budgets  not a recipe for efficiency or speed
And deficits can lead to inflation if central banks monetize the government debt a serious concern in financial markets as China has warned America
These concerns require that fiscal exit strategies be planned announced and implemented soon before the stimulus programs become permanently entrenched develop powerful dependent constituencies and greatly increase the risk of rising interest rates inflation and taxation
On this score citizens everywhere from Boston to Berlin Mumbai to Moscow are right to be appalled at the explosion of government debt
The Grand Illusions
Politicians are often accused of promising what cannot be delivered
In Argentina economists sold politicians on two dreams that could not be fulfilled
Their failure plunged the country into its deepest political and financial crisis in decades
President Fernando de la Ra was brought down by riots that left  dead
Citizens facing unpaid salaries frozen bank accounts and unemployment of  are suffering the consequences of two grand economic illusions
The first concerned the supposed restorative powers of a currency board
Call it the magic wand illusion
When in  Argentina tied the peso to the dollar and prevented its central bank from printing pesos freely the world applauded  with good reason
The new policy ended decades of high inflation and currency debauchery
But the currency board was not just a monetary system it was also a reform strategy
That overreach began Argentinas undoing
The country had not reformed previously  the theory went  because it did not need to
If unions bid up wages too high a devaluation could fix the problem if provincial governments spent a little too much a quick round of peso printing would save the day
Inflation was the grease that had kept the wheels of Argentine politics going
Shut off the peso spigot  economists counseled  and politics would fix itself
Without an inflationary cushion labor markets would have to be modernized and peso wages would fall to the point were the country could compete internationally
Fiscal policy would also be straightened out because the central bank was no longer the lender of last resort
Local banks and corporations would never again overborrow knowing that no safety net would catch them when they fell
Even politicians liked this theory since they could blame the monetary straightjacket for some of their unfulfilled promises
The magic wand illusion was not invented in Argentina
Like many things in that country it was imported from Europe
Adopt a common currency many a Continental economist had promised and fiscal laggards such as Italy and Greece would shape up
In Europe the combined carrot of northern transfers and the stick of northern reproach did the trick
Most southern European nations today display public finances that are Lutheran in their prudence
In Argentina the currency board did the trick  at the start
In the earlytomid s budget deficits turned into surpluses bank and financial supervision tightened and labor market reform was repeatedly attempted if never achieved
Argentina was briefly Wall Streets darling
Then came Mexicos crisis and Russias and Asias
The world economy turned sour for emerging markets
At that point Argentina fell victim to the second false promise  call it the golden child illusion
The world economy will help you as long as you help yourself policy gurus told Argentinas politicians
If you suffer a shock just turn the other cheek
If you need to borrow for liquidity world market will supply those funds at reasonable interest rates
No matter what dont touch the currency board the linchpin of your credibility
Until late in the game Argentina did as it was told
President de la Ra countered the terms of trade and interest rate shocks from abroad with domestic tax increases even as the economy contracted
Contrary to conventional wisdom the government did not go on a spending binge
Despite the temptation to spend its way out of slump Argentinas noninterest expenditure remained roughly constant
In  the nation ran a budget surplus of  of domestic output which became a total deficit of  once interest payments were added in
Public debt stood at a moderate  of output
In short it did as much as the oncegolden child in the class could have been expected to
World capital markets did not reciprocate
Spreads charged on loans to Argentina went from huge to obscene
Interest payments drove up the deficit which spooked investors who demanded even higher spreads enlarging the deficit even more
Most governments forced to pay  a year or more on dollar loans would eventually run out of money and stop paying
This is what has happened to Argentina
In the endgame the consequences of a policy based on illusions reared their ugly heads
The temporary discipline imposed by the currency board had masked the absence of crucial reforms
The weakest link was the fiscal regime tying the federal government and the rest of the country together which remained discretional and full of loopholes
As the budget situation deteriorated transfers from Buenos Aires to provincial governments became a matter for daytoday political bargaining
The lack of a fiscal framework hindered credibility
Cut off from credit Argentina entered a deflationary spiral
Never mind that Cavallo promised a zerodeficit policy spending only what the government took in
Budget cuts reduced demand and output which caused revenue to collapse making additional budget cuts inevitable
The lesson would have been obvious to Keynes with monetary policy immobilized by the currency board and with fiscal policy immobilized by lack of financing the economy could only go down
The shock absorbers that were dismissed as unnecessary for a golden child world capital markets remember were supposed to finance your way out of a slump turned out to be crucial
In defending the currency board and trying to avoid a default visvis those who hold pesos in their pockets Argentina ended up defaulting against everyone else its public employees whose salaries were either never paid or arbitrarily cut its provinces who have not received the transfers accorded them by law its depositors who can no longer withdraw their funds freely from the bank and crucially its democracy with the mandate of a popularly elected president cut short by rioting and looting
Now is the time to cut free of these two illusions
Since no one will save Argentina Argentines must save themselves
A necessary step is to abandon convertibility and let the peso float while transforming outstanding obligations to pesos so as to prevent the devaluation from wrecking the balance sheets of local banks and corporations
The moratorium on foreign debt payments announced by incoming President Rodrguez Sa will help cushion the blow
With the currency at a level that makes Argentina competitive again reconstruction can begin
With no currency board to instill a false sense of discipline real institutional reform will have to be tried
Provincial finances will finally have to be cleaned up
It will be a long painful road
But this time Argentina will not travel under the illusions fostered by economic scribblers both dead and alive
The Great American Mirage
NEW HAVEN  In September  during the depths of the Asian financial crisis Alan Greenspan the United States Federal Reserve chairman at the time had a simple message the US is not an oasis of prosperity in an otherwise struggling world
Greenspan point is even closer to the mark today than it was back then
Yes the US economy has been on a weak recovery trajectory over the past three years
But at least it a recovery claim many  and therefore a source of ongoing resilience in an otherwise struggling developed world
Unlike the Great Recession of  today there is widespread hope that America has the capacity to stay the course and provide a backstop for the rest of the world in the midst of the euro crisis
Think again
Since the first quarter of  when the US economy was bottoming out after its worst postwar recession exports have accounted for fully  of the subsequent rebound
That right with the American consumer on ice in the aftermath of the biggest consumption binge in history the US economy has drawn its sustenance disproportionately from foreign markets
With those markets now in trouble the US could be quick to follow
Three regions have collectively accounted for  of America exportled growth impetus over the past three years  Asia Latin America and Europe
Since regional and country trade statistics assembled by the US Department of Commerce are not seasonally adjusted all subsequent comparisons are presented on the basis of a comparable seasonal comparison from the first quarter of  to the first quarter of 
Not surprisingly Asia led the way accounting for  of the total US export surge over the past three years
The biggest source of this increase came from the percentagepoint contribution of Greater China the People Republic Taiwan and Hong Kongnbsp Needless to say China unfolding slowdown  even under the softlanding scenario that I still believe is most credible  is taking a major toll on the largest source of America export revival
The remainder of the Asianled US export impetus is spread out led by South Korea Japan and Taiwan  all exportled economies themselves and all heavily dependent on a slowing China
Latin America provided the secondlargest source of America export resurgence accounting for another  of the total gains in US foreign sales over the past three years
Brazil and Mexico collectively accounted for  percentage points of that increase
Growth in both economies is now slowing significantly especially in Brazil
But given the close linkages between Mexican production and US consumption which is now sputtering again any resilience in the Mexican economy could be shortlived
Finally there is the sad case of Europe which has accounted for  of the cumulative growth in US exports over the past three years
Here the US Commerce Department statistics are not as helpful in pinpointing the source of the impetus because only a partial country list is published
What we do know is that the United Kingdom Germany and France  the socalled core economies  collectively accounted for just  of total US export growth since early  with the UK grabbing the bulk of that increase
That suggests that most of America European export gain was concentrated in the region socalled peripheral economies
And that is clearly a serious problem
Forecasts are always hazardous but some hatif scenarios shed considerable light on what all of this means for the world largest economy
Since the second quarter of  US annualized real GDP growth has averaged 
With roughly  of that increase attributable to exports that means the remainder of the economy has grown at an anemic  pace
Under a flatline export scenario with no rise in US exports and if everything else remains the same always a heroic assumption overall real GDP growth would converge on that  bogey
That is a weak growth trajectory by any standard  likely to result in rising unemployment and further deterioration in consumer confidence
Alternatively in a moderate exportdownturn scenario with real exports falling by  over a fourquarter period real GDP growth could slip below the  tall speed threshold  leaving the US economy vulnerable to a recessionary relapse
By way of reference the assumption of a  export downturn pales in comparison with the precipitous  decline in real exports that occurred in 
As such this hat if is a cautiously optimistic assessment of the downside risks stemming from weak external demand
All of this underscores one of the more obvious yet overlooked implications of an increasingly interdependent world we are all in it together
The euro crisis is a serious shock and is now producing ripple effects around the world
Europe is exportled China largest source of external demand as China goes so goes the rest of Chinacentric Asia and from there the ripples reach the shores of an increasingly exportdependent US economy
As recent weakness in employment and retail sales suggests that may already be happening
Greenspan warning in  came at a time when US exports accounted for only about  of GDP
Today that share stands at a recordhigh  as postcrisis America has made a big bet on an exportled revival
The current global slowdown is not on a par with what occurred in the late  or the more wrenching shocks of  years ago  at least not yet
But today global downturn can hardly be dismissed as unimportant for the US or anyone else
In an era of globalization there are no innocent bystanders
There are certainly no oases of prosperity in the face of yet another major shock in the global economy
America growth mirage is an important case in point
The Great American Tea Party
NEW YORK  Who were those flagwaving cheering hollering singing and praying Americans who gathered in Washington DC on the last Saturday in August at a rally to estore the honor of the United States
This taxfree jamboree of patriotism was ostensibly nonpartisan otherwise it could not have been taxfree
The main organizer and speaker was Glenn Beck the rightwing populist radio and TV personality who promised to restore not only the nation honor but merican values too
The other star was Sarah Palin the darling of the populist Tea Party crowds who began by paying her respect to Martin Luther King Jr
For it was here on this very same spot and date that he gave his  have a dream speech in 
She then quickly proceeded to give a long celebratory speech about the heroism of US soldiers ighting for freedom abroad
It seemed an odd  and to many offensive  transition from King great plea for civil rights to Palin sentimental clichs about the military
But then there was something odd about the entire event just as there is something odd about the Tea Party movement itself
This latest surge of American populism is financed by some extremely wealthy men including a couple of oil billionaires named David and Charles Koch who favor cutting taxes for the superrich and abolishing government subsidies for the poor such as Social Security and President Barack Obama healthcare plan
This agenda might seem selfish though understandable from the point of view of an oil billionaire
But who are all those people wildly cheering for the billionaire dream on of all days the anniversary of Martin Luther King speech
They are almost uniformly white largely middleaged and above and for the most part far from wealthy
The majority have no college degree
Many say that they are afraid of losing their jobs
No doubt quite a few of them would have trouble paying the astronomical costs of American healthcare bills without government assistance
In other words they would benefit from the publicly financed programs that the Tea Party sponsors wish to abolish
And yet there they are denouncing as ocialism Obama healthcare legislation or a slight tax increase for the richest  of the population
To them ocialism means uropean or simply nAmerican
Unlike the movement sponsors the crowds chanting SA
USA do not appear to be motivated by economic selfinterest
It is possible that many Americans are still so convinced that anyone who works hard will end up rich that they will support anything that favors billionaires
But it is more likely that the grassroots of American populism are motivated by something else
Populism everywhere is driven by fear and resentment fear of being powerless without status or privilege and resentment of those  educated liberal elites foreigners who supposedly take our jobs and Muslims Jews blacks or illegal immigrants  who seem to enjoy undeserved benefits
These fears and resentments exist everywhere now more than ever
But they are not expressed in the same way in every country
Rural Americans living on the vast plains uprooted and isolated from the outside world have a history of expressing their longing for community and mystical identity by gathering in large numbers in churches and tents listening to the grand statements of charismatic hucksters
Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck are heirs to a long line of preachers and politicians who made their fortunes by stirring up anxious crowds promising them Heaven on Earth or at least a place in Heaven
In the case of Beck rally in Washington DC the link with history of rural churches and religious evival meetings was overt
America after andering in darkness today begins to turn back to God Beck declared in the typical style of a TV evangelist
Part of such rabblerousers stockintrade is to conflate patriotism freedom and God
This is the myth of the US the Godblessed land of the free
Underlying Beck onpartisan preacher talk about restoring American honor and values was a message that everyone in the crowd understood such unAmerican elements as the liberal elites in New York and Washington Democrats and other Godless socialists had robbed America of its honor and values
After the event Beck gave an interview in which he criticized Obama  not for his tax policies but for having the wrong religious beliefs
Obama he said believes in iberation theology which means that he must be a ocialist thus unAmerican
This is also what Palin means when she tells her Tea Party crowds that they are the eal Americans implying that all Americans who disagree with her views are not
They are aliens who have no right to govern the nation
The success of the Tea Party movement has made many Democrats and some sober Republicans nervous
There are calls for the Democrats to fight back
This is not impossible
Democratic politicians have a populist tradition too
Talk of God freedom and nation is not unique to rightwing radicals or Republicans
Franklin D Roosevelt knew how to inspire the patriotism of working men
John F Kennedy was good at selling the American dream
Lyndon B Johnson had the common touch of rural Texas
Barack Obama is from urban Hawaii but has all the rhetorical gifts of an oldfashioned preacher
Alas he has several distinct disadvantages too he was educated at two elite universities his middle name is Hussein and his father was black
Any one of these would be a handicap at a time of rising populism but the combination of all three is lethal
The Tea Party movement  an economic agenda for the rich masquerading as the salvation of Godfearing white Americans  knows that all too well
The Great Ape Debate
In his History of European Morals published in  the Irish historian and philosopher WEH Lecky wrote
At one time the benevolent affections embrace merely the family soon the circle expanding includes first a class then a nation then a coalition of nations then all humanity and finally its influence is felt in the dealings of man with the animal world
The expansion of the moral circle could be about to take a significant step forwards
Francisco Garrido a bioethicist and member of Spain parliament has moved a resolution exhorting the government o declare its adhesion to the Great Ape Project and to take any necessary measures in international forums and organizations for the protection of great apes from maltreatment slavery torture death and extinction
The resolution would not have the force of law but its approval would mark the first time that a national legislature has recognized the special status of great apes and the need to protect them not only from extinction but also from individual abuse
I founded the Great Ape Project together with Paola Cavalieri an Italian philosopher and animal advocate in 
Our aim was to grant some basic rights to the nonhuman great apes life liberty and the prohibition of torture
The Project has proven controversial
Some opponents argue that in extending rights beyond our own species it goes too far while others claim that in limiting rights to the great apes it does not go far enough
We reject the first criticism entirely
There is no sound moral reason why possession of basic rights should be limited to members of a particular species
If we were to meet intelligent sympathetic extraterrestrials would we deny them basic rights because they are not members of our own species
At a minimum we should recognize basic rights in all beings who show intelligence and awareness including some level of selfawareness and who have emotional and social needs
We are more sympathetic to the second criticism
The Great Ape Project does not reject the idea of basic rights for other animals
It merely asserts that the case for such rights is strongest in respect to great apes
The work of researchers like Jane Goodall Diane Fossey Birute Galdikas Frans de Waal and many others amply demonstrates that the great apes are intelligent beings with strong emotions that in many ways resemble our own
Chimpanzees bonobos and gorillas have longterm relationships not only between mothers and children but also between unrelated apes
When a loved one dies they grieve for a long time
They can solve complex puzzles that stump most twoyearold humans
They can learn hundreds of signs and put them together in sentences that obey grammatical rules
They display a sense of justice resenting others who do not reciprocate a favor
When we group chimpanzees together with say snakes as nimals we imply that the gap between us and chimpanzees is greater than the gap between chimpanzees and snakes
But in evolutionary terms this is nonsense
Chimpanzees and bonobos are our closest relatives and we humans not gorillas or orangutans are their closest relatives
Indeed three years ago a group of scientists led by Derek Wildman proposed in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that chimpanzees have been shown to be so close to humans genetically that they should be included in the genus Homo
Like any important and novel idea Garrido proposal has aroused considerable debate in Spain
Some are concerned that it will interfere with medical research
But the only European biomedical research that has used great apes recently is the Biomedical Primate Research Centre at Rijswijk in the Netherlands
In  a review by the Dutch Royal Academy of Science found that the chimpanzee colony there was not serving any vital research purposes
The Dutch government subsequently banned biomedical research on chimpanzees
Thus there is no European medical research currently being conducted on great apes and one barrier to granting them some basic rights has collapsed
Some of the opposition stems from misunderstandings
Recognizing the rights of great apes does not mean that they all must be set free even those born and bred in zoos who would be unable to survive in the wild
Nor does it rule out euthanasia if that is in the interest of individual apes whose suffering cannot be relieved
Just as some humans are unable to fend for themselves and need others to act as their guardians so too will great apes living in the midst of human communities
What extending basic rights to great apes does mean is that they will cease to be mere things that can be owned and used for our amusement or entertainment
A final group of opponents recognizes the strength of the case for extending rights to great apes but worries that this may pave the way for the extension of rights to all primates or all mammals or all animals
They could be right
Only time will tell
But that is irrelevant to the merits of the case for granting basic rights to the great apes
We should not be deterred from doing right now by the fear that we may later be persuaded that we should do right again
The Great Bank Robbery
NEW YORK  For the American economy  and for many other developed economies  the elephant in the room is the amount of money paid to bankers over the last five years
For banks that have filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission the sum stands at an astounding  trillion
Extrapolating over the coming decade the numbers would approach  trillion an amount vastly larger than what both President Barack Obama administration and his Republican opponents seem willing to cut from further government deficits
That  trillion dollars is not money invested in building roads schools and other longterm projects but is directly transferred from the American economy to the personal accounts of bank executives and employees
Such transfers represent as cunning a tax on everyone else as one can imagine
It feels quite iniquitous that bankers having helped cause today financial and economic troubles are the only class that is not suffering from them  and in many cases are actually benefiting
Mainstream megabanks are puzzling in many respects
It is now no secret that they have operated so far as large sophisticated compensation schemes masking probabilities of lowrisk highimpact lack Swan events and benefiting from the free backstop of implicit public guarantees
Excessive leverage rather than skills can be seen as the source of their resulting profits which then flow disproportionately to employees and of their sometimesmassive losses which are borne by shareholders and taxpayers
In other words banks take risks get paid for the upside and then transfer the downside to shareholders taxpayers and even retirees
In order to rescue the banking system the Federal Reserve for example put interest rates at artificially low levels as was disclosed recently it also has provided secret loans of  trillion to banks
The main effect so far has been to help bankers generate bonuses rather than attract borrowers by hiding exposures
Taxpayers end up paying for these exposures as do retirees and others who rely on returns from their savings
Moreover lowinterestrate policies transfer inflation risk to all savers  and to future generations
Perhaps the greatest insult to taxpayers then is that bankers compensation last year was back at its precrisis level
Of course before being bailed out by governments banks had never made any return in their history assuming that their assets are properly marked to market
Nor should they produce any return in the long run as their business model remains identical to what it was before with only cosmetic modifications concerning trading risks
So the facts are clear
But as individual taxpayers we are helpless because we do not control outcomes owing to the concerted efforts of lobbyists or worse economic policymakers
Our subsidizing of bank managers and executives is completely involuntary
But the puzzle represents an even bigger elephant
Why does any investment manager buy the stocks of banks that pay out very large portions of their earnings to their employees
The promise of replicating past returns cannot be the reason given the inadequacy of those returns
In fact filtering out stocks in accordance with payouts would have lowered the drawdowns on investment in the financial sector by well over half over the past  years with no loss in returns
Why do portfolio and pensionfund managers hope to receive impunity from their investors
Isn it obvious to investors that they are voluntarily transferring their clients funds to the pockets of bankers
Aren fund managers violating both fiduciary responsibilities and moral rules
Are they missing the only opportunity we have to discipline the banks and force them to compete for responsible risktaking
It is hard to understand why the market mechanism does not eliminate such questions
A wellfunctioning market would produce outcomes that favor banks with the right exposures the right compensation schemes the right risksharing and therefore the right corporate governance
One may wonder If investment managers and their clients don receive high returns on bank stocks as they would if they were profiting from bankers externalization of risk onto taxpayers why do they hold them at all
The answer is the socalled eta banks represent a large share of the SP  and managers need to be invested in them
We don believe that regulation is a panacea for this state of affairs
The largest most sophisticated banks have become expert at remaining one step ahead of regulators  constantly creating complex financial products and derivatives that skirt the letter of the rules
In these circumstances more complicated regulations merely mean more billable hours for lawyers more income for regulators switching sides and more profits for derivatives traders
Investment managers have a moral and professional responsibility to play their role in bringing some discipline into the banking system
Their first step should be to separate banks according to their compensation criteria
Investors have used ethical grounds in the past  excluding say tobacco companies or corporations abetting apartheid in South Africa  and have been successful in generating pressure on the underlying stocks
Investing in banks constitutes a double breach  ethical and professional
Investors and the rest of us would be much better off if these funds flowed to more productive companies perhaps with an amount equivalent to what would be transferred to bankers bonuses redirected to wellmanaged charities
The Great Brain Race
WASHINGTON DC  For decades research universities in the United States have been universally acknowledged as the world leaders in science and engineering unsurpassed since World War II in the sheer volume and excellence of the scholarship and innovation that they generate
But there are growing signs that the rest of the world is gaining ground fast  building new universities improving existing ones competing hard for the best students and recruiting UStrained PhDs to return home to work in university and industry labs
Is the international scholarly pecking order about to be overturned
There is no question that the academic enterprise has become increasingly global particularly in the sciences
Nearly three million students now study outside their home countries  a  increase in the last decade
Foreign students now dominate many US doctoral programs accounting for  of PhDs in computer science for example
Tsinghua and Peking universities together recently surpassed Berkeley as the top sources of students who go on to earn American PhDs
Faculty are on the move too
Half of the world top physicists no longer work in their native countries
And major institutions such as New York University and the University of Nottingham are creating branch campuses in the Middle East and Asia
There are now  satellite campuses worldwide an increase of  in just the past three years
At the same time growing numbers of traditional source countries for students from South Korea to Saudi Arabia are trying to improve both the quantity and quality of their own degrees engaging in a fierce  and expensive  race to recruit students and create worldclass research universities of their own
All this competition has led to considerable handwringing in the West
During a  campaign stop for instance thencandidate Barack Obama spoke in alarmed tones about the threat that such academic competition poses to US competitiveness
f we want to keep on building the cars of the future here in America he declared e can afford to see the number of PhDs in engineering climbing in China South Korea and Japan even as it dropped here in America
Nor are such concerns limited to the US
In some countries worries about educational competition and brain drains have led to outright academic protectionism
India and China are notorious for the legal and bureaucratic obstacles they place in front of Western universities that want to set up satellite campuses catering to local students
And sometimes students who want to leave face barriers
Several years ago the president of one of the prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology effectively banned undergraduates from accepting academic or business internships overseas
There are other impediments to global mobility too not always explicitly protectionist but all having the effect of limiting access to universities around the world
In the years following the terrorist attacks of September   for example legitimate security concerns led to enormous studentvisa delays and bureaucratic hassles for foreigners aspiring to study in the US
Student numbers have since rebounded despite intermittent problems but there remain severe limits on work and residency visas which should serve as an enticement for the best and brightest to study in the US
Perhaps some of the anxiety over the new global academic enterprise is understandable particularly in a period of massive economic uncertainty
But educational protectionism is as big a mistake as trade protectionism
The globalization of higher education should be embraced not feared  including in the US
There is every reason to believe that the worldwide competition for human talent the race to produce innovative research the push to extend university campuses to multiple countries and the rush to train talented graduates who can strengthen increasingly knowledgebased economies will be good for the US as well
Above all this is because the expansion of knowledge is not a zerosum game
More PhD production and burgeoning research in China for instance doesn take away from America store of learning on the contrary it enhances what we know and can accomplish
Because knowledge is a public good intellectual gains by one country often benefit others
Chinese research may well provide the building blocks for innovation by US entrepreneurs  or those from other countries
Indeed the economic benefits of a global academic culture are significant
Just as free trade provides the lowestcost goods and services benefiting both consumers and the most efficient producers global academic competition is making free movement of people and ideas on the basis of merit more and more the norm with enormously positive consequences for individuals universities and countries
Todays swirling patterns of mobility and knowledge transmission constitute a new kind of free trade free trade in minds
The US should respond to the globalization of higher education not with angst but with a sense of possibility
Neither a gradual erosion in the US market share of students nor the emergence of ambitious new competitors in Asia Europe and the Middle East means that American universities are on an inevitable path to decline
By resisting protectionist barriers at home and abroad by continuing to recruit and welcome the world best students by sending more students overseas by fostering crossnational research collaboration and by strengthening its own research universities the US can sustain its wellestablished academic excellence while continuing to expand the sum total of global knowledge and prosperity
The Great Contraction of 
CAMBRIDGE  A popular view among economic forecasters and market bulls is that he deeper the recession the quicker the recovery
They are right  up to a point immediately after a normal recession economies do indeed often grow much faster than usual over the ensuing twelve months
Unfortunately the Great Recession of  is far from being a normal global recession
The Great Recession was turbocharged by a financial crisis making it a far more insidious affair that typically has far more longlasting effects
As Carmen Reinhart and I argue in our new book This Time is Different Eight Centuries of Financial Folly  the Great Recession is better described as he Great Contraction given the massive and simultaneous contraction of global credit trade and growth that the world has experienced
Fortunately despite a hobbled recovery in the developed world emerging markets in Asia Latin America and the Middle East have enormous latent growth potential
Most should be able to grow strongly despite the challenging global environment
Nevertheless the legacy of the huge contraction in credit is not likely to go away anytime soon
Yes if you are a bank particularly a big one you can raise money easily enough thanks to sweeping explicit and implicit government guarantees
But for everyone else particularly small and mediumsize firms the credit environment continues to be very challenging
Even firms in established industries such as energy report facing great difficulties in raising capital
The optimists say not to worry
Credit will soon come to everyone else as easily as it has to the banks
After all credit also dried up during the  global recession and yet funds were flowing briskly within  months
But this parallel fails to recognize the fact that balance sheets remain far more impaired this time
Housing prices are being propped up temporarily by myriad subsidies while a commercial realestate tsunami looms
Many banks weaknesses are simply being masked by government guarantees
Indeed G governments now face the daunting prospect of trying to rein in the monster they have created
It is now very clear that the taxpayer will always be there to guarantee that bondholders get paid
Unchecked large financial firms will be able to tap bond markets for decades to come at rates just above what the government pays regardless of the inherent risk of their asset positions
Lenders to banks will not bother worrying about what kinds of gambles and investments financial institutions are making or whether regulation is effective
The good news is that most governments do see the need to implement significant new regulation on financial firms
But here the rub financial regulation is enormously complicated all the more so given that there must be some degree of international consistency
It would be a disaster if countries were to rush in individually to implement their own new system
On the other hand if regulators take their time to et it right there will be a huge shadow of uncertainty hanging over the financial system
Banks know that they face higher capital requirements which will force them to scale back lending relative to their resources
But how much higher
There is much discussion of breaking up banks that are too big to fail
But what will actually happen
Given this environment no wonder credit is still contracting in the United States Europe and elsewhere
If banks don know what the rules of the game are going to be they have to be very cautious about overextending their balance sheets
So government regulators  and ultimately all of us  are caught between a rock and a hard place
Regulate in haste repent at leisure
Overly strict regulation could seriously impair global growth for decades
But if regulation is too soft the next monster global financial crisis could come within a decade
And even if regulators take their time to try to get it right as most of us think they should the world may have to live with weak credit expansion as banks hold back awaiting a clearer verdict on their future
And here is another painful thought that Harvard historian Niall Ferguson often emphasizes many of the leaders and legislators who are passing judgment on new rules for banks are the same leaders and legislators who oversaw the regulation in the runup to the financial crisis
I am often asked why economies get themselves into such a bind again and again throughout economic history
Unfortunately as Reinhart and I document empirically for hundreds of financial crises covering  countries and eight centuries the answer is all too simple arrogance and ignorance
Investors and policymakers are often altogether ignorant of the myriad historical experiences with financial crises
And the few that are dimly aware of what has happened in other times and other places all too often say on worry this time is different
Perhaps the Great Contraction of  will be different from other deep financial crises and we will see a sustained sharp recovery worldwide
But G policymakers are best advised not to bet on it and to counsel patience particularly in epicenter countries
The Great Debt Scare
NEW HAVEN  It might not seem that Europe sovereigndebt crisis and growing concern about the United States debt position should shake basic economic confidence
But they apparently have
And loss of confidence by discouraging consumption and investment can be a selffulfilling prophecy causing the economic weakness that is feared
Significant drops in consumerconfidence indices in Europe and North America already reflect this perverse dynamic
We now have a daily index for the US the Gallup Economic Confidence Index so we can pinpoint changes in confidence over time
The Gallup Index dropped sharply between the first week of July and the first week of August  the period when US political leaders worried everyone that they would be unable to raise the federal government debt ceiling and prevent the US from defaulting on August 
The story played out in the news media every day
August  came and went with no default but three days later a Friday Standard amp Poor lowered its rating on longterm US debt from AAA to AA
The following Monday the SampP  dropped almost 
Apparently the specter of government deadlock causing a humiliating default suddenly made the US resemble the European countries that really are teetering on the brink
Europe story became America story
Changes in public confidence are built upon such narratives because the human mind is very receptive to them particularly humaninterest stories
The story of a possible US default is resonant in precisely this way implicating as it does America sense of pride fragile world dominance and political upheavals
Indeed this is arguably a more captivating story than was the most intense moment of the financial crisis in  when Lehman Brothers collapsed
The drop in the Gallup Economic Confidence Index was sharper in July  than it was in  although the index has not yet fallen to a lower level than it reached then
Most confidence indices today are based on survey questions that ask respondents to assess the economy today or in the near future
George Gallup the pioneer of survey methods and creator of the Gallup poll created a confidence index in  late in the Great Depression when he asked Americans o you think business will be better or worse six months from now
He interpreted the answers as measuring ublic optimism and he intangible mental attitude which is recognized as one vital element in the weektoweek fluctuations of business activity
But it hardly seems likely that big changes in people confidence the kind of confidence that affects their willingness to spend or invest are rooted in expectations over so short a time horizon
When George Gallup wrote almost nine years after the Great Depression began a sense of ultimate futility  a belief that high unemployment would never end  was widespread
That sentiment probably held back consumption and investment far more than any opinions about changes in the next six months
After all consumers willingness to spend depends on their general situation not on whether business will be a little better in the short term
Likewise businesses willingness to hire people and expand operations depends on their longerterm expectations
The Consumer Sentiment Survey of Americans created by George Katona at the University of Michigan in the early  and known today as the ThomsonReuters University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers has included a remarkable question about the reasonably longterm future five years hence and asks about visceral fears concerning that period
ooking ahead which would you say is more likely  that in the country as a whole wel have continuous good times during the next five years or so or that we will have periods of widespread unemployment or depression or what
That question is usually not singled out for attention but it appears spoton for what we really want to know what deep anxieties and fears do people have that might inhibit their willingness to spend for a long time
The answers to that question might well help us forecast the future outlook much more accurately
Those answers plunged into depression territory between July and August and the index of optimism based on answers to this question is at its lowest level since the oilcrisisinduced reat recession of the early 
It stood at  its highestever level in  at the very peak of the millennium stock market bubble
By May  it had fallen to 
By September just four months later it was down to 
This is a much bigger downswing than was recorded in the overall consumerconfidence indices
The decline occurred over the better part of a decade as we began to see the end of debtdriven overexpansion and accelerated with the latest debt crisis
The timing and substance of these consumersurvey results suggest that our fundamental outlook about the economy at the level of the average person is closely bound up with stories of excessive borrowing loss of governmental and personal responsibility and a sense that matters are beyond control
That kind of loss of confidence may well last for years
That said the economic outlook can never be fully analyzed with conventional statistical models for it may hinge on something that such models do not include our finding some way to replace one narrative  currently a tale of outofcontrol debt  with a more inspiring story
The Great Denial
CAMBRIDGE Social security is the great cash cow of irresponsible governments
At their beginning when governments introduce a traditional social security system they gain quite a few decades to collect taxes before the first sizeable payouts to retirees show up
But then yet a few decades later and reinforced by longer life expectancy and sharply lower birth rates the system goes bust tax inflows are insufficient to balance the outflows in the form of payments to retirees
What was attractive as a way of financing government in the second half of the th century becomes a formidable headache  years from now
The size of the problem the fact that it hits so many countries at the same time and the great difficulty of doing something about it all call for confronting it as soon as possible
Yet the Great Denial is practiced by governments and international institutions alike
This is as true in Japan as it is in Europe even though their problems are by far the worst in the world
In the past decade attention has focused on bringing down budget deficits establishing the EU convergence targets and the like
But these targets have been organized around the explicit public debt already on the books with absolutely no provision for the implicit debt implied by social security liabilities
Yet these liabilities are just as real as the existing public debt and in quite a few cases their present value is as high or higher than the public debt numbers
In Japan for example existing public debt is near  but there is an extra  of GDP in net pension liabilities
The sum is stunningly large and presumably unpayable
Moreover the prospect is not a distant one but something knocking at the door population hence the number of taxpayers is already declining the social security accounts are already turning to deficits and  years hence the debt mountain will be crushing capital markets
In such a situation one needs urgent reforms that create more taxpayers not fewer as is now the case as a result of partial restructuring without deregulation good budgets and lots of growth
Japan has none of these
But Japan is no exception
China has its problems
But unlike Japan it responds dramatically the childperfamily rule has just been junked
Why because  or  years from now China needs a lot of taxpayers to fund a wave of retirees opening up the rules on births now provides taxpayers down the road
That long horizon is entirely appropriate the view that the problem can be solved once we get there does not work because demographics is a slow process which now is on a very adverse trend
In Europe the trend is dramatically unfavorable more so in all the transition economies
A simple number to watch is this what is the growth rate of the population group of  to  yearsCthe taxpayers of 
In Poland that number is B  in Hungary  in the Czech Republic  in Romania and so on
Here is a crisis in the making because giving the old nothing means a huge poverty problem giving them something means huge tax burdens on a shrinking labor force
In Western Europe with substantial differences across countries the situation is not much better
Spain Italy Germany all have negative growth rates for young population groups
They all have very large net social security liabilities they all have excessive entitlements and too few future taxpayers to shoulder the burden
Those born now will live in a richer economy but they will get less of it because they will be paying through their nose to look after the large group of retirees who will vote the taxes
Are there exceptions to the gloomy outlook
Yes of course
In Britain the Thatcher government decoupled entitlements from current wages
The result is that net social security liabilities are essentially zero
In the US an effective social security system and sound public finance with surpluses at full employment increasingly funds for future retirees
What to do at this stage with the problem as yet distant but the leadtime for heading off catastrophe very long
The right policies focus on three fronts
First workers need to be encouraged to provide for their own retirement
In part this is accomplished by explicitly reducing entitlements and raising retirement age from absurdly low levels
But it is also accomplished by privatization of social security such that the mandatory contributions are taken out of the hands of government and invested for the future rather than dissipated in current spending
Second governments have to start running budget surpluses and use privatization to set aside revenues that can be invested to meet future claims
Third governments need to focus on policies that create employment and taxpayers
Paying people not to work as is common in Western Europe is scandalous and ultimately undermines public finance
Regulatory reform is essential so that as large firms increasingly restructure and shed labor workers can easily move into newly created jobs rather than winding up on the unemployment rolls
It is time to stop denying the problem
Radically different strategies of reform and restructuring on a broad front in the market and in public finance need to be phased in rapidly to create a prospect for dealing with the problem
Adverse demographic trends combined with bad welfare state policies have created a time bomb that cannot be defused once it is about to go off
The Great Depression Analogy
PRINCETON  Whenever today economic crisis is discussed analogies to the Great Depression are never far away
In its latest orld Economic Outlook the IMF examines the analogy explicitly in terms not only of the collapse of financial confidence but also of the rapid decline in global trade and industrial activity
In general history rather than economic theory seems to offer a guide to interpreting wildly surprising and inherently unpredictable events
Almost every contemporary use of the depression analogy takes the year  as a reference point
But two completely different pathologies were manifest in the Great Depression each called for different diagnoses  and different cures
The first and most famous pathology was the stock market crash of October  in the United States
No other country had a stock market panic of similar magnitude in large part because no other country had experienced the euphoric runup of stock prices that sucked large numbers of Americans from very different backgrounds into financial speculation
The second pathology was decisive in turning a bad recession into the Great Depression
A series of bank panics emanated from central Europe in the summer of  and spread financial contagion to Great Britain then to the US and France and finally around the world
The  panic has dominated all analysis of the depression for two rather peculiar reasons
First no one has ever been able to explain satisfactorily the October  market collapse in terms of a rational cause with market participants reacting to a specific news event
So the crash presents an intellectual puzzle and economists can build their reputations on trying to find innovative accounts
Some people conclude that markets are simply irrational
Others strain to produce complicated models according to which investors might have been able to foresee the Depression or ponder the likelihood of protectionist reactions in other countries to the American tariff act though the US legislation had not yet even been finalized
The second reason that  has been popular with academic and political commentators is that it provides a clear motive for taking particular policy measures
Keynesians have been able to demonstrate that fiscal stimulus can stabilize market expectations and thus provide an overall framework of confidence
Monetarists tell an alternative but parallel story of how stable monetary growth avoids radical perturbations
The  crash had no obvious cause but two very plausible solutions
The European banking disaster of  was exactly the other way round
No academic laurels are to be won by finding innovative accounts as its cause the collapses were the result of financial weakness in countries where bad policies produced hyperinflation which destroyed banks balance sheets
Intrinsic vulnerability made for heightened exposure to political shocks and disputes about a Central European customs union and about war reparations was enough to topple a house of cards
But repairing the damage was tough
Unlike  there were and are no obvious macroeconomic answers to financial distress
Some famous macroeconomists including Larry Summers the current chief economic thinker of the Obama administration have tried to play down the role of financialsector instability in causing depressions
The answers if they exist lie in the slow and painful cleaning up of balance sheets and in microeconomic restructuring which cannot simply be imposed from above by an omniscient planner but requires many businesses and individuals to change their outlook and behavior
The improvement of regulation and supervision while a good idea is better suited to avoiding future crises than to dealing with the consequences of a catastrophe that has already occurred
The consequence of the long academic and popular discussion of the  crisis is that people have come to expect that there must be easy answers
But the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September  was a like event highly reminiscent of the world of depression economics
Austrian and German bank collapses would not have driven the entire world from recession into depression if those countries had simply been isolated or selfcontained economies
But they had built their economies on borrowed money  chiefly from America  in the second half of the 
That dependence is analogous to the way in which money from emerging economies mostly in Asia flowed into the US in the  when an apparent economic miracle was based on China willingness to lend
The bank collapses in  and in September  have shaken the confidence of the international creditor then the US now China
Both lessons  about the slowness and painfulness of bank reconstruction and about dependence on a large external provider of capital  are unpalatable
For a long time it was much easier to repeat the soothing mantra that the world community had collectively learned how to avoid a style collapse and that the world central banks clearly showed this in  or 
Governments undoubtedly merit praise for stabilizing expectations and thus preventing crises from worsening
But it is misleading when officials tout simple if not simplistic policy proposals as the basis for hoping that we can avoid a long period of difficult economic adjustment
The Great Depression in Economic Memory
PARIS  The dispute that has emerged in the United States and Europe between proponents of further government stimulus and advocates of fiscal retrenchment feels very much like a debate about economic history
Both sides have revisited the Great Depression of the   as well as the centurieslong history of sovereigndebt crises  in a controversy that bears little resemblance to conventional economicpolicy controversies
The prostimulus camp often refers to the damage wrought by fiscal retrenchment in the US in  four years after Franklin Roosevelt election as US president and the launch of the New Deal
According to computations by the economist Paul van den Noord the net result of the  budget was a fiscal contraction amounting to three percentage points of GDP  certainly not a trivial amount
Economic growth plummeted from  in  to  in  and GDP shrank  in  while unemployment rose from  to roughly 
Although fiscal policy was not the only cause of the double dip illtimed retrenchment certainly contributed to it
So are we in  and does the budgetary tightening contemplated in many countries risk provoking a similar doubledip recession
Clearly there are limits to the comparison
For starters much less time has elapsed since the financial crisis the recession has been much shallower and recovery has come faster
Moreover important developments that occurred between the  stockmarket crisis and the  fiscal retrenchment  especially America turn to protectionism in  and the monetary turmoil of subsequent years ave no analog today
Nevertheless the  episode does seem to illustrate the dangers of attempting to consolidate public finances at a time when the private sector is still too weak for economic recovery to be selfsustaining
Another case with similar consequences was Japan valueadded tax increase in  which precipitated a collapse of consumption
Fiscal hawks also rely on historybased arguments
The economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff have studied centuries of sovereigndebt crises and remind us that today developed world has a forgotten history of sovereign default
A particularly telling example is the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars of the early nineteenth century when a string of exhausted states defaulted on their obligations
The  are relevant here as well given another series of defaults among European states not least Germany
What history tells us here is that defaults are not the privilege of poor undergoverned countries
They are a threat to all especially in times of high capital mobility when governments rely too much on foreign lenders apparent willingness to provide funds and find themselves in dire straits when capital inflows stop
Again there are limits to comparisons it is especially hard to infer from past episodes the limits to public debt
After all British public debt exceeded  of GDP in the aftermath of World War II and Britain did not default
But an important insight from history is that unsustainable fiscal policies are more likely to result in defaults when fiscal problems cannot be inflated away
This was the case under the goldbased monetary regimes such as the Gold Standard of the nineteenth century and it is the case today for countries that have relinquished their monetary autonomy such as the members of the eurozone
In normal times history is left to historians and economicpolicy debate relies on models and econometric estimates
But attitudes changed as soon as the crisis erupted in 
Indeed central bankers and ministers were obsessed at the time by the memory of the  and they consciously did the opposite of what their predecessors did  years ago
They were right to do so
In extraordinary times history is in fact a better guide than models estimated with data from ordinary times because it captures variance that standard timeseries techniques ignore
If one wants to know how to deal with a banking crisis the risk of a depression or the threat of a default it is natural to examine times when those dangers were around rather than to rely on models that ignore such dangers or treat them as distant clouds
In times of crisis the best guides are theory which captures the essence of a problem and the lessons of past experience
Everything in between is virtually useless
The danger with relying on history however is that we have no methodology to decide which comparisons are relevant
Loose analogies can easily be regarded at proofs and a vast array of experiences can be enrolled to support a particular view
Policymakers whose knowledge of economic history is generally limited are therefore at risk of being drowned in contradictory historical references
History can be an essential compass when past experience provides unambiguous headings
But an undisciplined appeal to history risks becoming a confusing way to express opinions
Governance by analogy can easily lead to muddled governance
Let it Bleed
BERKELEY  In the  years of the Great Depression  between the stockmarket crash of  and America mobilization for World War II  production in the United States averaged roughly  below the predepression trend implying a total output shortfall equal to  years of GDP
Today even if US production returns to its stableinflation output potential by   a huge f  the US will have incurred an output shortfall equivalent to  of a year GDP
In fact the losses from what I have been calling the esser Depression will almost certainly not be over in 
There is no moral equivalent of war on the horizon to pull the US into a mighty boom and erase the shadow cast by the downturn and when I take present values and project the US economy lowertrend growth into the future I cannot reckon the present value of the additional loss at less than a further  of a year output today  for a total cost of  years of GDP
The damage is thus almost equal to that of the Great Depression  and equally painful even though America real GDP today is  times higher than it was in 
When I talk to my friends in the Obama administration they defend themselves and the longterm macroeconomic outcome in the US by pointing out that the rest of the developed world is doing far worse
They are correct
Europe wishes desperately that it had America problems
Nevertheless my conclusion is that I should stop calling the current episode the Lesser Depression
Yes its shape is different from that of the Great Depression but so far at least there is no reason to rank it any lower in the hierarchy of macroeconomic disasters
The US bond market agrees with me
Since  the nominal annual premium on the year Treasury bill has averaged  in other words over its lifespan the year nominal Tbill yields are  percentage points more than the expected average of future shortterm nominal Tbill rates
The current year Tbill yields  annually which means that unless the marginal bond buyer today is unusually averse to holding year Treasuries she anticipates that shortterm nominal Tbill rates will average  per year over the next generation
The US Federal Reserve keeps the shortterm nominal Tbill rate near  only when the economy is depressed capacity is slack labor is idle and the principal risk is deflation rather than upward pressure on prices
Since WWII the US unemployment rate has averaged  when the shortterm nominal Tbill rate is  or lower
That is the future that the bond market sees for America a slack and depressed economy if not for the next generation at least for most of it
Barring a wholesale revolution in thinking and personnel at the Fed and in the US Congress activist policies will not rescue America
Once upon a time policymakers understood that the government should tweak asset supplies to ensure sufficient supplies of liquid assets safe assets and savings vehicles
That way the economy as a whole would not come under pressure to deleverage and thus push production below potential output
But this basic principle of macroeconomic management has simply gone out the window
A majority of the Fed governors believes that aggressive monetary expansion has reached if not exceeded the bounds of prudence
A majority in the US Congress is taking its cues from heodoric of York Medieval Barber a staple of the US comedy show Saturday Night Live in the 
It believes that what America infirm economy needs is another good bleeding in the form of more rigorous austerity
As Oscar Wilde Lady Bracknell says in The Importance of Being Earnest o lose one parentay be regarded as a misfortune
To lose both looks like carelessness
It was America misfortune to undergo one disaster of the Great Depression scale to undergo two does indeed look like carelessness
What then should economists who seek to improve the world do if we can no longer realistically expect to nudge policy in the right direction
At a similar point in the Great Depression John Maynard Keynes turned away from focusing on influencing policy
Instead he attempted to reconstruct macroeconomic thought by writing his General Theory of Employment Interest and Money so that the next time a crisis erupted economists would think about the economy in a different and more productive way than they had between  and 
This week the economist and frequent US official Lawrence Summers in a lecture at the London School of Economics called for another reconstruction of macroeconomic thought  and of the institutions and orientation of central banking
That is a Keynesian ambition but can it be accomplished
A latterday Keynes is nowhere to be found and no Bretton Woodsstyle global consensus to reform central banking is on the horizon
Read an extended version of this argument in J Bradford DeLong blog post arbers on the March
The Great Escapism
NEW YORK  Barack Obama however mixed his accomplishments to date as US president has sought to rebrand America and reclaim its former signature asset its ability to embody universally admired values As popular culture is usually the way those values are transmitted it is worth considering what it is about American cinema music and popular literature that makes them so compelling to many other parts of the world
After all much of what America once monopolized in Hollywood movies and other popculture exports is now being reproduced locally
Bollywood competes with California in terms of glamorous stars and big production numbers Japan and South Korea mint their own pop singers and fashion trends
But consider Entourage the American TV show that centers on a rising male film star and his posse of dudes
Or a recent article in The New Yorker about two scruffy young chefs who have set out across the country to start the great adventure of running their own crazy restaurant called Animal
Or Swingers the  worldwide hit movie about a twentysomething guy in Hollywood and his band of male friends who drag him to Las Vegas to mend his broken heart
One of America last competitive cultural exports it seems is the postadolescent male escape fantasy
Ever since Huck Finn took his friends down the Mississippi River on a raft American men have created and consumed fantasies of setting out with their males friends for parts unknown or of traveling in an allmale group to have adventures closer to home
In the  Jack Kerouac took his buddy careening across the country in On the Road
A decade later Ken Kesey took his buddies the Merry Pranksters across the country in the other direction in their painted bus granted with female hangerson
From Easy Rider in the  to the Harold and Kumar movies today the uddy film  typically involving travelbased adventure  has become an established genre
Savvy American politicians even make use of it for their own purposes
Both John McCain and George W Bush cleverly tapped into this fantasy  with its easy bonhomie and absence of wives and kids  to capture the hearts of the male journalists aboard their campaign buses who could imagine themselves once again as tough unfettered and venturesome Kerouac figures
President Obama even gave the actor who played Kumar a job in the White House which he has now left to return to Hollywood
As you survey the rest of global culture the maleescape scenario is hard to spot emerging from any other place
Save for the recent hit film  Idiots Bollywood doesn send groups of Indian guys off on merry irresponsible adventures
Male protagonists in French films don take off together in convertibles for the Pyrenees they stay home and urbanely have affairs
Nor does Japanese pop culture manufacture escape fantasies aimed at Japanese men
Yet men all over the world tune in to Americanmade fantasies of male bonding and male escape  escape from the bonds of work and domesticity and if only for a youthful period of the male lifespan from longterm commitment to women themselves
This fantasy derived no doubt from American history  from westward expansion and Manifest Destiny from the Gold Rush and a settlement policy that valorized staking a claim to the wilderness and subduing it  is powerfully appealing to men in general and to many women as well
Indeed American women have recently begun to film and export their own versions of this fantasy  starting with the groundbreaking  film Thelma and Louise and continuing in a growing trend of girlgroup travel and escape packages
Other countries lack of male escape fantasies in their popular culture may be no less historically rooted less transient more traditional societies will not warmly welcome homegrown films and pop songs about local young men taking off and fleeing their responsibilities
But judging by the appetite shown worldwide for this narrative it seems clear that identification with such adventures is almost universal
It seems to speak to a deep longing in men  and in the women who also enjoy these films and TV shows  for a time in one life when one could dash toward freedom adventure and selfreinvention unencumbered by social ties and family obligations
At its best this genre is part of America gift to the rest of the world
At its worst it is part of America curse
That whiff of careening heedless adolescent fecklessness is part of what makes the archetypal American male presence alarming when he is equipped with a global cudgel
To the rest of the world those same qualities are part of his charm only so long as he stays safely up on the screen
The Great European Debt Breakup
BRUSSELS  Financial markets almost just succeeded in breaking up the eurozone
So the idea of harnessing the power of the market and of financial engineering to guarantee the euro longterm viability might seem paradoxical
But this is precisely what our proposal to split eurozone sovereign debt into senior and junior tranches aims to achieve
The senior tranches would comprise debt totaling up to  of the GDP of each participating country
These countries would then pool this debt and issue a joint and several guarantee
The resulting lue Bond named after the color of the European flag would be an extremely safe and highly liquid asset comparable in volume to United States Tbills thereby helping the euro rise as an international reserve currency and ensuring low refinancing costs for the bulk of eurozone debt
By contrast any debt beyond  of GDP would have to be issued as junior ed Bonds under purely national responsibility
These ed Bonds would make borrowing beyond  of GDP more expensive thereby enhancing fiscal discipline and reinforcing the targets set by the Stability and Growth Pact
Moreover Red Bonds could be conveniently ringfenced so that they do not destabilize the banking system thereby ensuring that the nobailout clause that applies to them becomes a credible proposition
For example the European Central Bank should exclude Red Bonds from its repo facility and a standardized collectiveaction clause to facilitate debt rescheduling should be made mandatory for Red Bonds
If implemented successfully our proposal would lower the costs of debt service while strengthening the incentives for individual countries to pursue fiscally responsible policies
This is what distinguishes our proposal from suggestions that all eurozone debt be pooled in euro bonds in a spirit of solidarity
But successful implementation of this plan requires a rocksolid governance structure that markets and taxpayers in the most stabilityoriented eurozone countries can trust
In particular the danger of ission creep  the temptation to expand the ofGDP debt ceiling for Blue debt  needs to be addressed
That is why we believe that the annual allocation of Blue Bond emissions should be delegated to an Independent Stability Council
The council would offer a takeitorleaveit proposal to the participating countries on the allocation of Blue Bonds for the coming year
Each national parliament would then adopt the proposal given participating countries role in providing the guarantees implied by that allocation
Within this mechanism countries that pursued reckless fiscal policies could be gradually excluded from the system by lowering their Blue Bond allocation
And countries unhappy with the system evolution could gradually exit it simply by rejecting their annual Blue Bond allocation for a sufficient number of years in a row  thereby no longer issuing Blue Bonds or guaranteeing the fresh Blue Bonds of others
The Independent Stability Council not wishing to lose the Blue Bond club most stabilityoriented members would have a strong incentive to ensure that these countries interests are properly taken into account
In economic substance the Blue Bond scheme is compatible with the nobailout clause in Article  of the EU Treaty because the debt guarantee would apply only to senior debt amounting at most to  of GDP the level that the Maastricht Treaty deems sustainable for any EU member state
Therefore the guarantee would not apply to debt crises caused by excessive borrowing to finance unsustainable fiscal policies
To the extent that a higher debt ratio is allowed only in exceptional situations Article  of the Treaty such as natural disasters where a bailout would be allowed a legal conflict should not arise
But the ultimate test for our proposal is whether the eurozone countries  their confidence shaken by the debt crisis  have an interest in coming together and participating in this voluntary scheme
We believe they might
First smaller countries with relatively illiquid sovereign bonds stand to benefit substantially from the extra liquidity provided by the Blue Bond
Second countries with high debt levels would welcome this opportunity to control borrowing costs and to commit to stronger fiscal discipline after the current crisis
Even those countries uncertain about the benefits of enhanced fiscal discipline are likely to consider participation because markets could interpret refusal as a bad signal
But provided that the Blue Bond institutional safeguards are sufficiently robust the countries that stand to gain the most from the scheme promise of strengthened fiscal discipline are those that worry most about having to foot the bill for sovereign bailouts  now and in the future
The Great Firewall of China
Writing from  Shanghai China great essayist Lu Xun once observed oday there are all kinds of weeklies
Although their distribution is not very wide they are shining in the darkness like daggers letting their comrades know who is attacking the old strong castles
Muckraking broadsheets in the first half of the last century played catandmouse games with Chinese government censors ultimately helping to expose the corruption and moral bankruptcy of the Nationalist KMT government and contributing to the Communist victory in 
If that sounds familiar its is because the Chinese Communist Party never forgets its history  and is determined to prevent history from repeating itself
Thus China rulers acted in character last December when they cracked down on news organizations that were getting a bit too assertive
The editor and deputy editors of Beijing News a relatively new tabloid with a national reputation for exposing corruption and official abuse were fired
In protest more than  members of the newspaper staff walked out
Most Chinese might not have known about the walkout if it hadn been for Chinese bloggers
An editorial assistant at the New York Times Zhao Jing writing under the pen name Michael Anti broke the news on his widely read Chineselanguage blog
He exposed details of behindthescenes politics and called for a public boycott of the newspaper evoking strong public sympathy for the journalists expressed online in chatrooms and blogs
Zhao blog wasn under the direct control of the Party Propaganda Department
It was published through a Chineselanguage bloghosting service run by Microsoft MSN Spaces
On December  Zhao blog disappeared
Since then Microsoft has confirmed that its staff removed the blog from an MSN Internet server citing the need to respect Chinese law when doing business in China
Microsoft contribution to Chinese political repression follows Yahoo role in the sentencing of a dissident reporter and Google decision not to display search results that are blocked by what has become known as the reat Chinese Firewall
Indeed China has developed the world most sophisticated system of Internet blocking and censorship thereby hiding information unfavorable to China rulers from all but the most technologically savvy
The system is bolstered by human surveillance and censorship carried out not only by government employees but also by private service providers
Some liken Microsoft behavior to IBM infamous collaboration with the Nazis in Germany
Human rights activists in the United States are calling for legislation that would prevent American companies from engaging in business practices that help repressive regimes stifle democratic movements
But the companies argue that there is absolutely no other way to compete  they must either comply with censorship or discontinue business
If MSN Spaces did not censor its Chinese blogs Microsoft argues the Great Chinese Firewall would simply be programmed to block Chinese Internet users from accessing its service
In fact most international bloghosting services are blocked in China which provides a competitive boon to several hundred domestic bloghosting services
These services with names like Bokeecom Blogbuscom and Blogcncom all comply with Chinese government censorship requirements
Software prevents users from posting politically sensitive words and provocative content that gets past the automated controls is frequently removed
These businesses would not be allowed to exist otherwise
Despite the censorship the Chinese blogosphere is blossoming with probably somewhere between  million active blogs
The Chinese public has grown expert over the years at finding plenty of things to do and talk about while avoiding politically dangerous issues
Chinese bloggers are no different
New pop cultural celebrities are emerging online and people are creating their own radio and even TV shows
Naturally the Chinese companies that provide most of the tools used to create and host this content have censorship built into their software management structure and business models
But most Chinese bloggers accept this as part of the reality of life in China
They are not willing to fight for greater freedom of speech and are even willing to censor each other in order to preserve what they have
Which brings us back to China greatest modern writer Lu Xun
In  he wrote a biting piece of social criticism he True Story of Ah Q about a hapless character who adjusts his values to whatever the circumstances and people around him seem to demand
Unfortunately faced with a choice between protecting the longterm interests and human rights of their customers and complying with laws implemented by unelected powerholders technology firms like Microsoft Yahoo and Google seem to have embraced the Ah Q spirit
They have made it clear that when it comes to free expression their priorities lie on the side of surrender
In the long run this does not bode well for their global reputations which depend on users trust in the openness and independence of their products and services
One day perhaps censorship will no longer make good business sense anywhere
The Great Game New Players
NEW DELHI  Two reat games currently roil South Asia
In the West Afghanistan  and what Henry Kissinger calls slamist Jihadists  challenges the international order
In the East a large number of Chinese troops have entered Pakistaniheld territory high in the mountain fastness of the Kashmir Karakorams in the picturesque GilgitBaltistan region not far from the glacial battlefield of Siachen where India and Pakistan confront each other
Senge Hasan Sering from Skardu the director of the GilgitBaltistan National Congress believes that the number of Chinese People Liberation Army troops now present ould be over  as there are also additional LA construction corps personnel deployed
It is here that China is currently investing illions of dollars in mega projects like expressways tunnels and oil and gas pipelines
This Sering says is urely not on account of any overflowing altruism
The Chinese say that some of their troops are present in Pakistan because of another sort of verflowing of which there has been a great deal in this part of Kashmir and in the rest of Pakistan
This year heavy monsoon rains have wrought havoc in the area severing road connections washing away bridges and rendering over half a million people homeless in these mountains  without wellings farmlands moveable assets or even raveyards
This is over and above the many thousands in the Hunza region who in January lost everything on account of a cloudburst that wiped out several villages and created a highly unstable artificial lake
Rudyard Kipling old reat Game now has new contestants
Instead of an expansionist Russian empire confronting Imperial Britain it is now a China hungry for land water and raw materials that is flexing its muscles encroaching on Himalayan redoubts and directly challenging India
China incursion reaffirms the ancient strategic axiom that eography is the real determinant of history  and as a result of foreign and security policy too
Robert Kaplan wisely observes that ndian geography is the story of invasions from a northwesterly direction and ndia strategic challenges still inhere in this fact which is why Afghanistan to Indian eyes is linked to the subcontinent history and thus our future
It is also why there exists an rganic connection of India to Central Asia the key to that link lying in the Himalayas which is where the IndiaChina rivalry is currently focused
Fortunately at least for the present this rivalry is far less emotional than IndiaPakistan relations having not been born of historical grievances
The Chinese urge is to break from the confines of their country history and thus China own geography
An assertive and relatively stable China it seems must expand lest pentup internal pressures tear it apart
A strong and stable India on the other hand will always be a status quo power
It is against this backdrop that the latest contest between India and China must be assessed
Several thousand PLA troops are indisputably stationed in the Khunjerab Pass on the Xinjiang border to protect the Karakoram Highway which PLA soldiers are now repairing in several places
The road after all is a vital link in China quest for direct access to the Arabian Sea
But this is also Indian territory wherein lies the rub for the region is now victim to a creeping China acquisitiveness with Pakistan acquiescing as a willing accomplice
Despite India historically established territorial claims to the region China terms the area isputed a description that it has now begun to extend to the whole of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir
This sort of verbal trickery to hide a strategic objective has been seen before
Indeed some years back a planned visit to Indian Ladakh by the PLA commander of the Lanzhou Military Region was canceled on the grounds that Pakistan had protested  implying that Pakistan had a legitimate claim to the area
It would be a mistake to presume that the vast expansion of trade between India and China currently worth more than  billion annually with China now India largest trading partner must lead to improved bilateral relations
Even while trade expands China is attempting to confine India within greatly foreshortened land and sea borders through its socalled tring of pearls policy
This effort to encircle India by sea with strategically positioned naval stations from Hainan in the East to Gwadar in the West and on land by promoting bogus Pakistani claims that undermine India territorial integrity takes the reat Game to a new and more dangerous level
Indeed the pincer of Afghanistan and GilgitBaltistan poses the gravest challenge to India statecraft since Independence
More than that the struggle now underway at the top of the world may well determine whether this will be an sian Century or a hinese Century
The Great Global Bargain Hunt
TOKYO  Few recent elections have grabbed world attention in the way that Greece vote on June  did
Now that the centerright New Democracy which finished first has formed a coalition government with the centerleft PASOK and the Democratic Left the key issue for Prime Minister Antonis Samaras administration is whether it can implement the austerity measures agreed with Greece eurozone partners in exchange for continued support from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union
The situation remains dangerous  and not only for Greece
Spain and Italy face the redemption of government bonds valued at  billion  billion and  billion respectively in July with redemptions continuing every month thereafter like an unstoppable tsunami ensuring continued turmoil in Europe and beyond
Given the global menace posed by Europe sovereigndebt and banking crises measures to strengthen the European banking system and encourage fiscal integration gained some momentum at the recent G summit in Los Cabos Mexico
The summit concluding statement declared that countries with ample finances are prepared to provide economic stimulus if growth weakens
One result of this promise is that pledges to boost the IMF funding have now reached  billion
These pledges come on top of the  billion expansion of IMF funding that was announced in April so the Fund should have the financial firepower to act in any crisis  if that is the money pledged at the G summit is actually contributed
The BRICS Brazil Russia India China and South Africa which are all members of the G now account for  of the world population and  its economy
Their share of nternational responsibility was revealed at the recent summit contributions to the IMF of  billion by China  billion by Brazil Russia and India and  billion by South Africa
Mexico the G host also pledged  billion
This renewed international cooperation was intended of course to protect the global financial system
But contributing money also means having a say and the BRICS  no surprise  are pressing their demand for voting reform in the IMF and are increasingly offering currency swaps to economically troubled countries
Various countries however are also strengthening their own positions with little regard for the impact of their actions on the international financial system
The most active of these countries is of course China which can call upon its vast and stillrising foreign reserves of  trillion to push its interests in every corner of the globe
For example although China has done little to bolster the Greek government balance sheet its active approach to the crisis has been conspicuous
Prime Minister Wen Jiabao visited Greece in October  and agreed to strengthen cooperation between China and Greece during a meeting with thenPrime Minister George Papandreou  timely support that the weakened Greek government was delighted to receive
But the form of Chinese support for Greece will likely benefit China far more than Greece in the long term
Indeed in an editorial published on June  China Daily described Greece as a ateway for China into Europe
Already the China Ocean Shipping Company COSCO has obtained a year lease to operate the second pier at the port of Piraeus one of the busiest in the world for  billion and has purchased a truckloading facility and packaging center in the Piraeus suburbs
The company has also expressed its intention to acquire  of Piraeus Port Authority and is seeking to lease or acquire ports on the island of Crete
Likewise though COSCO bid for the Thessaloniki Container Terminal met local opposition Chinese investors are in negotiations with the Greek government to acquire a year interest  in Athens International Airport for  million
China may look like a white knight for Greece which remains mired in fiscal crisis and severe recession but this was also a perfect chance for China to go bargain hunting around the world
So instead of using its vast foreign exchange reserves to bolster the international system China is picking up strategic assets on the cheap
Consider Iceland which suffered bitterly following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 
An enormous Chinese Embassy has been built in Reykjavik with an eye to improving China intelligence about future developments in the Arctic Ocean
And Chinese companies land purchases in Iceland have been so extensive as to fuel local paranoia with some investment plans blocked for fear that they might be a steppingstone to a Chinese military presence
For almost a decade people have wondered how China would use its gargantuan foreignexchange reserves particularly whether it would challenge the supremacy of the dollar
It now seems clear that China intends to use its foreign reserves to further its own global geopolitical strategy not to buttress the international system that has enabled its threedecade boom
As governments and citizens around the world become aware of the influence that China can buy with its deep pockets is an antiChinese backlash inevitable
Or have some countries been so scarred by the financial crisis that they don care where their next meal ticket comes from
Time will tell but there is a danger that Chinese hubris is beginning to extend to global finance
The Great Hydrogen Hope
RHINECLIFF NEW YORK  In Jules Verne novel The Mysterious Island  published in  Cyrus Harding the book engineerhero declares that ater will one day be employed as fuel that hydrogen and oxygen which constitute it used singly or together will furnish an inexhaustible source of heat and light
Water Harding announces would be decomposed oubtless by electricity into hydrogen and oxygen
Many of Verne musings remain fantasy but where hydrogen is concerned his time has come
Today several hundred hydrogenpowered prototype cars buses vans and minivans a motorcycle or two a few scooters utility vehicles including a slew of forklift trucks and even a couple of farm tractors are already operating
Two years ago the European Parliament in Strasbourg overwhelmingly passed a declaration urging a green hydrogen economy
The hydrogen projects are being developed in North America Europe Japan Korea Australia South America and embryonically in China and India
Most of the hydrogendriven vehicles are powered by fuel cells but both BMW and Mazda have converted gasoline engines to hydrogen fuel spiffy Vs for BMW rotary engines for Mazda
Indeed such major carmakers as Toyota Honda Daimler General Motors and HyundaiKia are deep into plans for commercial production of cars powered by hydrogen fuel cells
Honda showed a prototype fuel cell car assembly line last year Daimler already launched one this year HyundaiKia plans to have one by  and Toyota probably the biggest player by  with small outputs initially by the thousands later and increasing steeply after that
Like natural gas hydrogen can be used as a car fuel with engine modifications
But carmakers think fuel cells are the better more efficient silent clean power source for transportation
They function somewhat like a battery except that their fuel is constantly replenished reacting electrochemically with the air oxygen to make electricity to drive an electric motor
Today such vehicles are handbuilt and expensive typically costing roughly a million dollars each give or take a few hundred thousand dollars
But costs will come down once series production gets underway Toyota says that it expects to hock the industry with its cost reduction numbers when it launches commercial production
It expects costs for the fuel cell stacks the heart of the drive train to decline as much as 
In its most recent analysis the US Department of Energy estimated that using  technology and assuming a production volume of  units production costs for an kilowatt fuel cell would be about  per kilowatt
With expected technology improvements the cost would drop to about kW by  within shouting range of the department target of kW a benchmark figure that more or less corresponds to today manufacturing cost for gasoline engines
As for hydrogen fuel costs there are currently no fixed numbers but the US target is  per kilogram by around  a kilogram of hydrogen has about the same energy content as a gallon of gasoline
Because fuel cells are about twice as efficient as internal combustion engines the effective cost per unit of distance would be about half that
The US has traditionally been in the forefront of research and development in this field but in recent years hydrogen has been elbowed aside by intense lobbying for other alternatives
Some influential supporters argue plugin hybrids batterypowered vehicles and biodiesel cars are closer to market and that they are better less costly technologies than hydrogen and fuel cell cars
That view was embraced by the Obama administration leading to some embarrassment this summer for new Energy Secretary Steven Chu a Nobel Prizewinning physicist
Chu had ordered a  million cut in funding in  for hydrogen and fuel cell transportation technology
But an outcry from groups ranging from the Union of Concerned Scientists the National Research Council fuel cell and hydrogen associations to the American Lung Association and car manufacturers coupled with strong support in Congress will probably lead to a reversal of the cuts
It is worth noting that hydrogen supporters do not oppose battery powered cars and they embrace biofuels as another renewable source of hydrogen
But because of the weight of electric batteries their limited range cost and other considerations batteries are best suited primarily for shortrange city cars
In any case hydrogen fuel cell cars typically incorporate batteries in hybrid configurations enabling them to cover the mile range demanded by consumers
Countless laboratories are working on better cheaper hydrogen production and storage methods and on ways to bring down costs and boost fuel cell durability
Both shortcomings remain major concerns
Moreover a hydrogen fueling infrastructure must be built
This will be expensive but probably not more so than maintaining the current fossil fuel structure and will most likely start as station clusters or corridors in metropolitan areas that gradually spread outward
Cluster seeds are already underway in the Los Angeles and New York metropolitan areas and very significantly in Japan
Indeed in Tokyo more than a dozen major Japanese energy companies are said to be banding together to push the creation of a national hydrogen fueling infrastructure by 
The hydrogen revolution has started but with a slowburning fuse
Hydrogen is not the only weapon in the fight against global heating but it is an essential element  in the truest sense of the word
The Great Illusion
The saddest of the books on my office bookshelf is an old one published nearly a century ago Norman Angells The Great Illusion A Study of the Relation of Military Power in Nations to Their Economic and Social Advantage  which tried to prove that military conquest was obsolete
Angells argument was simple in all prolonged modern industrial wars everybody loses
Losers lose the most but winners also are worse off than if peace had been maintained
Many fathers sons and husbands are dead and so are many mothers wives and daughters
Much wealth has been blown up
Much architecture has been turned into rubble
Confiscation damages the rule of law on which modern industrial prosperity rests
The most that even the winners can say is that they are little losers rather than big losers
Modern industrial war is as the computer in the  movie War Games put it a very peculiar game The only way to win is not to play
At the time that Angell wrote some people argued that war was an important means to promote national prosperity that commercial prosperity was the fruit of military power
Angell puzzled over how preWWI panGerman politicians could believe that German prosperity required a big battle fleet when the absence of one made no difference to the prosperity of Norway Denmark or Holland
He looked forward to the coming of an age of rational statesmanship when every prime minister and foreign minister would recognize that regardless of the matter in dispute binding arbitration between nations was a better strategy than war
He was of course right in his judgment that the only way to prevent any modern industrial war from becoming a destructive tragedy for all was to quickly conclude a ceasefire
Governments that view aggressive war as a means to prosperity have been rare since the end of World War I the Imperial Japanese government that launched World War II in the Pacific and Saddam Husseins two grabs for oilfields are examples that spring immediately to mind
In one sense governments have learned the lesson Norman Angell preached
But what makes The Great Illusion the saddest book on my office bookshelf is that we have found other reasons to fight wars and the years since Angell wrote his book have seen the most terrible and bloody wars ever
We have fought wars to preserve colonial domination and wars to end it
We have seen civil wars
We have seen ideological wars
We have seen wars of extermination like the one that Hitler and the Nazis waged against not just Jews and Gypsies but Poles and Russians
We have seen ethnic wars and wars fought to make governments stop killing their citizens
Indeed we have seen more religious wars than at any time since the end of the Thirty Years War in 
Yet there is cause for hope
From the proconsulate of Julius Caesar until  there was most likely at least one army crossing or about to cross or thinking of crossing the Rhine in arms
Now there are none
A little more than a century and a half ago the United States appeared willing to go to war with the worlds only superpower of the time to try to turn Vancouver British Columbia into a city ruled from Washington DC rather than from Ottawa or London
Vancouver is a lovely city and I would love to have the voters of British Columbia inside the US because I think they would add much health to the American electorate
But nobody thinks that idea worth fighting a war over
A century ago a French politician was no more likely to advocate peace and detente with Germany than a modern Arab politician is likely to advocate peace and detente with Israel
Academic foreign policy realists who somehow strike me as not a very realistic bunch attributed the end of FrancoGerman antagonism to the fact that they had something bigger to be scared of Russia which was terrifying under Stalin frightening under Khrushchev and worrisome under Brezhnev
Let the Cold War end they said and then we will see France and Germany begin to rattle their sabers again for that is the tragedy of international power politics
Yet the Cold War has been over for fifteen years and military conflict between France and Germany today seems as unlikely as military conflict between America and Canada
I hope that it is the fact of European interdependence  an interdependence carefully constructed by Jean Monnet Robert Schumann Konrad Adenauer and those who followed in their footsteps  and not the memory of the horror of World War II that has caused the armies that used to cross the Rhine in arms to vanish
If so there is a chance that the globalized economic age to which we look forward will be a more peaceful age than the twentieth century was
If not then Angell may well continue to be as irrelevant as he was right
The Ghost of Inflation Future
DIJON  With all of the problems afflicting the world economy nowadays inflation seems to be the least of our worries
In addressing the post economic malaise which stems from overindebtedness policymakers are correct to focus on the threat of debt deflation which can lead to depression
But dismissing inflation as esterday problem could undermine central banks efforts to address today most pressing issues  and ultimately facilitate inflation resurgence
Understanding how the Great Inflation from the late  to the early  was tamed offers important lessons for addressing farreaching economic problems however different ours may be and provides insight into the dangers that may lie ahead
The first useful lesson concerns expectations
In the decades following World War II the doctrine that inflation needed to be traded off against employment  based on the relationship that William Phillips described in   dominated economic thinking
But the Phillips curve fared poorly in the  when many countries experienced tagflation high levels of both inflation and unemployment
This vindicated criticism by Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps among others who had already begun to argue that the Phillips curve represented merely a shortterm relationship
If people do not expect inflation the illusion of increased purchasing power can boost employment and output for a relatively short period
But once workers realize that real wages have not increased unemployment will return to its atural level consistent with stable inflation
Later ew classical economists like Robert Lucas and Thomas Sargent demonstrated that once people understand that inflation is being manipulated to generate market optimism the monetary authorities actions lose their impact
The result is higher prices and no job creation
These ideas combined with effective policy practice like that of the US Federal Reserve under Paul Volcker chairmanship led many countries worldwide toward more explicit inflation targeting in which central banks stabilize inflation expectations by making a credible commitment to a predetermined rate of price growth
By the  inflation was old news in the advanced economies with much of the developing world soon to follow
Today the Fed is again playing the expectations game
But in order to stave off the threat of deflation and depression it is targeting a lower unemployment rate below 
As progress toward that target is made Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke announced in late May the Fed will begin to aper its program of longterm asset purchases known as quantitativeeasing QE
That prospect has already sparked renewed financialmarket volatility
In July Bernanke attempted to calm investors with remarks signaling that amid inadequate employment gains and persistently low inflation the Fed would not abandon monetary stimulus anytime soon
This stance reflects the Fed dual mandate according to which monetary policy targets maximum employment consistent with price stability
But the credibility needed to anchor expectations is difficult  sometimes even impossible  to achieve when two targets are being pursued simultaneously
The resulting uncertainty could trigger more volatility especially in bond markets potentially impeding economic recovery for example by pushing up longterm mortgage rates or augmenting future inflation risk
By contrast the credibility associated with pursuing only an inflation target builds on itself
Given this it would be safer and more effective for the Fed and other central banks to pursue a single inflation target and then use the gain in credibility to aid economic recovery
For example a central bank might announce that circumstances during say the next two years warrant a doubling of the inflation target from the usual  that is almost never varied  annual rate of 
Such an approach would reduce the risk of debt deflation while capping inflation expectations to prevent a damaging surge in prices as recovery takes hold
Such preventive measures are all the more important in view of the Great Inflation second relevant lesson fiscal discipline is essential to price stability
Sustaining a high budget deficit over many years will lead to an unmanageable debt buildup unless that debt is inflated away or restructured
As it stands the United States  and presumably the United Kingdom  plans to begin tapering QE when the economy is growing faster unemployment is lower and government and household revenues are rising
But will tax revenues rise fast enough to offset the escalating cost of servicing the government mountain of debt
Even if public debt is not growing as fast as before the huge volume of existing debt must be repaid
The best cure would be controlled higher inflation  that is the aforementioned temporary increase in the inflation target  to erode the real value of public debt and forestall the risk of a much more damaging inflationary shock later one in which expectations become unhinged
But while this approach could work in the US the European Central Bank is institutionally constrained from raising the inflation target
Although its pledge last August to purchase unlimited quantities of shortterm government debt has calmed markets activation of the ECB utright monetary transactions program is conditional on continued fiscal retrenchment
So the eurozone crisisstricken economies cannot grow
In this context the eurozone most heavily indebted countries will have to force their creditors to accept a restructuring of public debt
The preferable alternative would be growthboosting devaluations  that is a eurozone breakup
But if as seems likely such devaluations are left too late debt restructuring might still be needed
In the coming years Europe appears set to lurch from the frying pan of depression to the fire of high inflation
When it does the lessons of the Great Inflation will suddenly be all too pertinent
The Great Job Machine
Until the third quarter of this year the number one doubt facing the US economy concerned the Pyrrhic character of its jobless recovery
Then during September and October of this year net employment grew by  well ahead of most forecasts
But while more than  new jobs were created in services over  manufacturing jobs were lost
This is more than can be explained by the longterm shift of the economy out of industry and into services
At the same time the jump in labor productivity in manufacturingby  in the third quarterindicates that there remains a great deal of excess capacity in the manufacturing sector
So dont look for any improvement in US employment to come through factory jobs
Instead it is the greater flexibility of services that has produced the resumption of employment growth in the US
Evidence for such growth abounds
For example Kohls a large department store has opened  new sites in October hiring some  people at each of them
Stop  Shop a chain of supermarkets has reintroduced a delivery service from cashiers to a clients carsomething done away with decades agoand has extended opening hours in many stores
Americas reborn service economy stands in stark contrast to what is found in Europe
Thanks to the European Commissions tough competition policy Europe has gone a long way towards making its industries more viable
In the service sector by contrast deregulation has been much more limited probably because services are much less exposed to international competition which means that old hidebound rules are easier to preserve
The outcome is that in Europe contrary to the US an increase in the demand for services produces higher rents rather than more jobs
Take the simple case of taxi licenses if the number of taxi licenses is fixed and consumers start using taxis more often what you will observe is at most an increase in the demand for powerful Mercedes cars that taxi drivers use not an increase in jobs
In other words a good indicator of the state of the US economy is how many people take care of you at a supermarket cashier
In many European countries you should instead look at the quality of the stereo in your taxi
The labor market flexibility in the US service sector is truly remarkable
During recessions and booms you can feel the changes in quality and number of waitresses in restaurants in the size of staffs in shops in the availability of cleaning services
In the roaring s it was almost impossible to find qualified restaurant staff to fill vacant jobs
During the stagnant economic years of the Bush administration such workers were plentiful
In Europe you simply certainly cant see these differences waiters busboys and cooks all have job security
Part of the problem here is that temporary shortterm jobs in Europe have a very bad connotation
To be sure the little employment growth that has been seen recently in Europe has mostly been as a result of temporary jobs
Even so such jobs are widely regarded as a plot by companies seeking to fire employees at their leisure
The fact that obstacles to shortterm employment contracts lead to longterm unemployment traps is often forgotten
Such perceptions reflect a deeper difference
By and large workers and management in Continental Europe retain many of the old class antagonisms that first emerged with the rise of industrialism in the  th Century
To this day they often still see each other as enemies
In the US such sentiments are much less ingrained in the culture
Leading  th Century American thinkersand even trade unionistsspoke of a harmony of interests between labor and capital and workers and managers continue to view each other more as a partner than an adversary
This is all the more remarkable in light of the enormousand still growingdisparities in compensation within US companies
The pay gap between workers and CEOs is far wider in the US than in Europe and yet resentment of the boss appears to be far higher in Europe
Yet beneath the surface things are beginning to move in Europe
Stealthily the competition authorities of the European Commission are starting to get tougher on professional services consider for example Competition Policy and Liberal Professions a statement that can be found on the European Commissions Web site wwweuropaeuint 
Once they have brought the cozy cartels of lawyers and accountants into line other service industries seem destined to be opened up to greater competition and hence to become great engines of job creation
Notwithstanding Europes labor unions temporary jobs are starting to be accepted
The American service industry job machine may be on its way across the Atlantic
The Great Man Syndrome
In our globalized age vast impersonal forces are supposed to determine events
Globalized markets unfettered trade militant Islam China awakening these are the things historians and strategists usually portray as the key forces shaping our destiny
But most people don see things this way
Instead most people still instinctively look at reat men as the agents of history the men and women who seem to forge events through their political vision personal charisma and the force of their moral claims
By sheer force of conviction and personality such figures many of us believe can carry the day bringing a glimmer of hope to an otherwise detached and impersonal universe
This yearning for providential men or women in our global age results from at least three factors
The first concerns the complexity and vulnerability of our world
The second paradoxically reflects our growing cynicism towards politics and politicians
And the third is the result of our media culture obsessed as it is with putting a ace to events
Confronted with the problem of bringing about positive changes in a domestic or international environment that seems to defy the power of ormal leaders one looks for new Alexanders to untie the ordian knot and transcend complexity by sheer force of will and dynamism
For example structural reforms in Europe are thought impossible to enact unless imposed by some reincarnation of Margaret Thatcher
In the Middle East everyone waits for a new Anwar Sadat to arise among the Arabs
Disillusion with politics and politicians also is a key element of our yearning for providential leaders
In France for example the overly flattering commemoration of President Franois Mitterrand death ten years ago primarily reflects widespread disillusion with his successor Jacques Chirac
Indirect criticism of the present is usually a key element in idealized views of the past
The less we expect from a ormal politician the more we look for a hero
With the world becoming a global stage the media role in fueling the appetite for providential leaders is essential
The public demands quick answers to complex problems that unsolved risk endangering the planet
They need figures with whom they can identify immediately recognize and above all trust
The emergence of an embryonic orld civil society heightens demand for universal and charismatic figures holding out the hope of global accountability but also carrying populist overtones
In a world searching for providential leaders the case of Ariel Sharon is both symbolic and paradoxical for this universal man remains one of the most controversial figures of recent decades
He has become a nearly revered figure in his country and large segments of Western public opinion believe that his political demise represents a potentially fatal blow to any hope of progress in the region even as he remains hated in large parts of the Arab and Muslim world
Sharon transformation from villain to hero within the space of a mere few years is a source of fascination for his people the region and the world  all the more so because his ultimate intentions will remain a subject of endless dispute among historians tomorrow and among politicians claiming to be his faithful heirs today
Was Sharon really convinced by demographers that the reat Israel that once seemed to be his dream would actually mean the end of a Jewish State or did his disengagement strategy of aza first really mean aza last
For those who support one or the other reading Sharon will forever hold the benefit of the doubt
That Sharon stroke could be compared  in terms of political consequences  with the assassination of Yitzak Rabin demonstrates that his personality had become associated with hope and security
The ulldozer had become the grandfather of most Israelis and the last card of Western diplomacy for Americans and surprisingly for Europeans too
He alone seemed to incarnate the combination of reassuring strength and vision to carry the majority of Israelis behind him in a process of unilateral disengagement
In fact one may wonder if the world has made of Sharon a providential man because it wanted so much to believe that there was still ope around the corner in the Middle East
Was this wishful thinking or selffulfilling prophecy
We will never know
What is certain is that the vacuum left by Sharon departure from politics is all the more striking in view of the images of chaos emerging from the Gaza that Israel has vacated and the collapse of the Palestinian authority before our eyes
Nor will the emergence of another providential figure come easily
Not all exceptional periods create their Bonapartes and this is probably a good thing for exceptional leaders may give the illusion that all problems have solutions which is far from true
The natural course of history in the most optimistic sense is progress t the margin but the rapid pace of technological change is pushing us to expect equally rapid progress in human affairs
Many of us believe that such an impossible wager can be fulfilled only by a providential man with all the hopes  and dangers  that this entails
The Great Moderation
It has been  years since Alan Greenspan became chairman of America Federal Reserve Bank
The years since then have seen the fastest global average income growth rate of any generation as well as remarkably few outbreaks of mass unemploymentcausing deflation or wealthdestroying inflation
Only Japan lost decadeandahalf and the hardships of the transition from communism count as true macroeconomic catastrophes of a magnitude that was depressingly common in earlier decades
This reat moderation was not anticipated when Alan Greenspan took office
America fiscal policy was then thoroughly deranged  much more so than it is now
India appeared mired in stagnation
China was growing but median living standards were not clearly in excess of those of China socalled olden years of the early  after land redistribution and before forced collectivization turned the peasantry into serfs
European unemployment had just taken another large upward leap and the ocialist countries were so incompatible with rational economic development that their political systems would collapse within two years
Latin America was stuck in its own lost decade after the debt crisis at the start of the 
Of course the years since  have not been without big macroeconomic shocks
America stock market plummeted for technical reasons in the fall of that year
Saddam Hussein invasion of Kuwait in  shocked the world oil market
Europes fixed exchange rate mechanism collapsed in 
The rest of the decade was punctuated by the Mexican peso crisis of  the East Asian crisis of  and troubles in Brazil Argentina Turkey and elsewhere and the new millennium began with the collapse of the dotcom bubble in  and the economic fallout from the September   terrorist attacks
Moreover today global imbalances and misaligned real exchange rates threaten to bring on not just mild recession but significant and prolonged depression
Yet so far none of these events  aside from Japan starting in the early  and the failures of transition in the lands east of Poland  has caused a prolonged crisis
Economists have proposed three explanations for why macroeconomic catastrophes have not caused more human suffering and deranged longrun economic growth over the past generation
First some economists argue that we have simply been lucky because there has been no structural change that has made the world economy more resilient
According to this view we have simply rolled the dice and won five times in a row
We should be happy and grateful but we should not expect it to continue
Second central bankers have finally learned how to do their jobs
Before  according to this theory central bankers switched their objectives from year to year
One year they might seek to control inflation but the previous year they sought to reduce unemployment and next year they might try to lower the government debt refinancing costs and the year after that they might worry about keeping the exchange rate at whatever value their political masters prefer
The lack of farsighted decisionmaking on the part of central bankers meant that economic policy lurched from stop to go to accelerate to slow down
When added to the normal shocks that afflict the world economy this source of destabilizing volatility created the unstable world before  that led many to wonder why somebody like Alan Greenspan  who had previously only spent a couple of years in government  would want the job
The final explanation is that financial markets have calmed down
Today the smart money in financial markets takes a longterm view that asset prices are for the most part rational expectations of discounted future fundamental values
Before  by contrast financial markets were overwhelmingly dominated by the herd behavior of shortterm traders people who sought not to identify fundamentals but to predict what average opinion would expect average opinion to be and to predict it before average opinion did
Thus central bankers were stuck trying to control a world economy shocked by random changes in the animal spirits of investors and traders
When I examine these issues I see no evidence in favor of the first theory
Our luck has not been good since 
On the contrary I think our luck  measured by the magnitude of the private sector and other shocks that have hit the global economy  has in fact been relatively bad
Nor do I see any evidence at all in favor of the third explanation
It would be nice if our financial markets were more rational than those of previous generations
But I don see any institutional changes that have made them so
So my guess is that we would be welladvised to put our money on the theory that our central bankers today are more skilled more farsighted and less prone to either shortsightedly jerking themselves around or being jerked around by political masters who unpredictably change the objectives they are supposed to pursue year after year
Long may this state of affairs continue
The Great Organ Bazaar
LUND SWEDEN  The Web site DBcom Philippines is an active online portal that allows service providers and consumers to find and interact with each other
Naoval an Indonesian man with B blood type no drugs and no alcohol wants to sell his kidney
Another man says  am a Filipino
I am willing to sell my kidney for my wife
She has breast cancer and I can afford her medications
Then there is Enrique who is illing to donate my kidney for an exchange
 years old and healthy
Other offers of this type could just a few years ago be found at wwwliveryouorg which promised kidneys for 
The costs of the operation including the fees of the surgeons  licensed in the United States Great Britain or the Philippines  would be included in the price
All of this Internet activity is but the tip of the iceberg of a new and growing global humantissue economy
Indeed the World Health Organization WHO has estimated that about  of organ transplants around the world stem from purely commercial transactions
Trade in organs follows a clear geographically linked pattern people from rich countries buy the organs and people in poor countries sell them
In my research on organ trafficking I have entered some of these shadow markets where body parts from the poor war victims and prisoners are commodities bought or stolen for transplant into affluent ill people
One woman originally from Lebanon told me that a wealthy businessman from Spain paid a huge sum for her kidney
In the end however she received no monetary payment
Today her life is much worse than before because medical complications following the operation make it difficult for her to work
Similar stories are told by organ vendors I have met from the former Soviet states the Middle East and Asia
Organ trafficking depends on several factors
One is people in distress
They are economically or socially disadvantaged or live in wartorn societies with prevalent crime and a thriving black market
On the demand side are people who are in danger of dying unless they receive an organ transplant
Additionally there are organ brokers who arrange the deals between sellers and buyers
It is also necessary to have access to wellequipped clinics and medical staff
Such clinics can be found in many countries including Iran Pakistan Ukraine South Africa and the Philippines
Indeed the Philippines is well known as a center of the illegal organ trade and a ot spot for transplant tourism
From the  until  when a new policy was adopted the number of transplantations involving organ sales by Filipinos to foreign recipients increased steadily
Many organ sellers from Israel for example were together with their buyers brought to Manila for the transplants
Hector is one of the several hundred cases of kidney vendors documented by social workers in three impoverished towns in the Philippines Quezon province
His brother was trapped in Malaysia with high debts to criminal gangs so Hector sold his kidney in order to buy his freedom
Another vendor Michel became a broker himself after selling one of his kidneys to pay for his father medicines the surgeon forced him to deliver more organs
The vendors organs were transplanted to recipients mainly from the Philippines Israel Japan South Korea and Saudi Arabia
Trade in humans and their bodies is not a new phenomenon but today businesses are historically unique because they require advanced biomedicine as well as ideas and values that enhance the trade in organs
Western medicine starts from the view that human illness and death are failures to be combated
It is within this conceptual climate  the dream of the regenerative body  that transplantation technology develops and demand for biological replacement parts grows
One of the more obvious manifestations of treating the human body as a resource to be mined is the hospital waiting list used in many countries
A man I interviewed recently for a study of Swedes who had been on the waiting list but who decided to purchase kidneys abroad described to me his trip to Pakistan for the transplant  not the kind of man who uses other people but I had to
I had to choose between dying and getting back my life
In an era of transplants on demand there is no way around this dilemma
The biological imperatives that guide the priority system of transplant waiting lists are easily transformed into economic values
As always where demand exceeds supply people may not accept waiting their turn  and other countries and other peoples bodies give them the alternative they seek
The Great Real Estate Bust of 
NEW HAVEN  What brought on the collapse of home prices in  that is the root of the financial crisis now enveloping much of the world
Home prices in the United States as measured by the Standard ampamp PoorCaseShiller Home Price Indices have plummeted more than  in real inflationadjusted terms in some major cities since the peak around the beginning of 
Nationally including all cities the fall is over 
The futures market at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is now predicting declines of around  more before the prices bottom out in 
These are the market forecasts  and it is not a very liquid market
But those who make these forecasts are implying real declines from peak to trough of more than  in some places 
Why are we seeing such big price drops
And why does the housing market in so many other countries now reflect similar conditions
The answer has both proximate and underlying causes
The proximate answer for the US is that a decline in lending standards helped people buy houses at everincreasing prices before 
Freer lending meant that people were freer to bid up prices of homes to ridiculous levels
Shacks were selling for a million dollars
After the peak lenders tightened their standards
When buyers find it difficult to finance home purchases sellers have to cut the asking price 
The up and down of lending represents a credit cycle and credit cycles have played a major role in economic fluctuations for centuries
In his  book 
 Lombard Street
  Walter Bagehot the British businessman and editor of 
 The Economist
  described these cycles perfectly
The boom just before the depression of the  that he described sounds a lot like what happened just before the current crisis
When credit expands he wrote he certain result is a bound of national prosperity the country leaps forward as if by magic
But only part of that prosperity has a solid reasonhis prosperity is precarious 
But the credit cycle was not the ultimate cause of the  depression or the crisis we are seeing today
Ultimately one must always ask why lending standards were loosened and then tightened
The credit cycle is an amplification mechanism
The instability in the lending sector is always there and the crisis manifests itself only if some precipitating factor triggers it
Moreover the extreme weakening and then tightening of credit standards seems particularly prominent only in the US while the housing boombust cycle is prevalent throughout much of the world
The precipitating factor that led to the current situation has to do with our evolving world culture spread rapidly through enhanced media outlets and the Internet and its perceptions of the markets
It has to do with the deep admiration of markets that has developed during the boom in line with the fficient markets theory in academic finance
It became widely believed that financial markets are such sublime poolers of information that they represent a collective judgment that transcends that of any mere mortal
James Surowiecki bestselling  book with the outrageous title 
 The Wisdom of Crowds
  pressed this idea forward at the very height of the real estate boom
The boom in the world housing markets and stock markets between  and  was caused by this faulty idea and the idea that investments in homes and equities are a sure route to wealth
It had become an article of faith that the value of both types of assets only goes up in the long run and that it is foolish to try to ime the market
It was sincerely believed and supported by deep intuitive judgment that interruptions in this upward trajectory could only be small and transient
People seemed to think that rapid appreciation in these markets had become a universal constant like the speed of light 
Nothing else ultimately explains lenders immense willingness in the boom up to  to lower their credit standards on home mortgages regulators willingness to let them do it rating agencies willingness to rate mortgage securities highly and investors willingness to gobble them up
There is no theory in economics that provides a reason to think that prices in these markets can only go up
On the contrary economic theorists have been puzzled by the historical rate of increase in the stock market which they call he equity premium puzzle
They do not have a corresponding name for the behavior of the housing market because historically its prices correcting for inflation have not generally gone up very much on average until the post bubble
The booms in these markets can be traced substantially to the growth of the idea that one should always continually hold as many of these assets as possible just as that you should drink green tea or eat dark chocolate every day for antioxidants
Such ideas create artificial demand  but only for a while
After all we no longer smoke cigarettes to prevent infections
People will believe many things if they have the impression that the rich and famous believe them too
But their belief can suddenly be disrupted if plainly visible events contradict it
That is what is happening now and  will shape up as a year of even more profound disenchantment
The Great War End in Syria
NEW DELHI  As the West begins to gear up for the centenary of the outbreak of World War I in  the Middle East is being convulsed as never before by the legacy of the Ottoman Empire breakup
Look no farther than Syria where one part of that legacy  the SykesPicot Agreement which divided the Levant into British and French spheres of influence even while the Great War still raged  is coming to a brutally violent end
Likewise the current turmoil in Turkey is at least in part a consequence of eoOttoman overreach by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoan government
In seeking to establish the type of regional influence that Turks have not had since Kemal Atatrk founded the Republic of Turkey Erdoan has fallen prey to some of the Ottoman regime hubris
The Levant has of course been the scene of countless conflicts through the centuries
Sir Archibald Wavell one of Britain greatest World War II generals and the penultimate Viceroy of India wrote in his biography of the WWI FieldMarshal Edmund Allenby who led the Allies in the Levant he greatest exploit in the history of horsed cavalry and possibly their last success on a large scale had ended within a short distance of the battlefield of Issus where Alexander the Great first showed how battles could be won
But peace still eludes the Levant
As Middle East analyst Murtaza Hussain recently observed yria and Iraq formerly unified Arab states formed after the defeat of their former Ottoman rulers exist today only in name
What will emerge could be a fragmented easily manipulated region
This is why Syria civil war is now a geopolitical battle for regional domination with multiple fractures along sectarian lines
As is now clear no country is really free of the charge of interfering in Syria
While Shiamajority Iraq has attempted to portray itself as neutral it has permitted Iranian flights to use its airspace to carry weapons to President Bashar alAssad regime
Iran too has long used its alliance with Syria to pursue its interests in the Levant which include support for Hezbollah in Lebanon
On the ground Hezbollah now openly fighting in Syria to keep Assad in power asserts that ar is coming to Aleppo the ancient city that is the heart of the antiAssad rebellion
Indeed according to Lakhdar Brahimi who serves as Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the Arab League for Syria there are an estimated  groups big and small fighting in the country
Meanwhile Saudi Arabia and Qatar  which Middle East commentator Saeed Naqvi has called the ost vulnerable Sunni Kingdoms  attempt o divert popular discontent along sectarian ShiaSunni lines
This ancient fracture papered over by Sir Mark Sykes and Franois GeorgesPicot  years ago in their secret agreement has now swallowed Syria with Assad portrayed as some sort of Alawite ogre
Many Western diplomats appear to be of the same superficial cast of mind as Sykes and Picot believing that Assad fall from power would remove Syria from the IranHezbollahHamas axis
But will it
And who or what will replace Assad
Surely not the ragtag groups fighting Assad regime even if the United States now supplies some of them with arms as President Barack Obama administration recently announced
Recent history suggests just how malleable the elements in play in Syria really are
Consider Saudi Arabia actions there
As Bruce Riedel an exCIA analyst and former National Security Council member recently noted ronically Saudi intelligence chief Prince Bandar was crucial to the transition in Syria from Hafez Assad to Bashar back in  assuring key Alawite generals then in the regime that Bashar was up to the job and had Saudi support
Now the same Prince Bandar s trying to get arms to the Sunni rebels to oust Bashar
Such longterm unpredictability is why the former European Union foreignpolicy high representative Javier Solana and former NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer assert that talks in Geneva are the only viable way out of the Syrian morass
An agreement last month between US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey V Lavrov to launch a new political process for Syria Geneva II marked a possible opportunity but hope is waning even before the talks begin
Indeed one reason for this is that on the opening day of the RussiaEU Summit in Yekaterinburg on June  Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed that his country will honor its contract with Syria to deliver S surfacetoair missiles
Putin stressed Russia disappointment over the EU failure to maintain the arms embargo against Syria thus permitting each EU member state to arm the Syrian rebels
Now with Obama decision to send arms as well his ed line in Syria  the use of chemical weapons  could well create a legacy as damaging to the region as that of the SykesPicot ine in the sand proved to be
To arm the rebel groups is perhaps inevitably also to arm their terrorist and mercenary allies
That is not a recipe for longterm stability

The Greek Conundrum
The euro is a unique and unusual construction whose viability is now being tested
Otmar Issing one of the fathers of the common currency correctly stated the principle on which it was founded the euro was meant to be a monetary union but not a political one
The participating states established a common central bank but they explicitly refused to surrender the right to tax their citizens to a common authority
This principle was enshrined in Article  of the Maastricht Treaty which has since been rigorously interpreted by the German constitutional court 
The principle however is patently flawed
A fullyfledged currency requires both a central bank and a treasury
The treasury need not be used to tax citizens on an everyday basis but it needs to be available in times of crisis
When the financial system is in danger of collapsing the central bank can provide liquidity but only a treasury can deal with problems of solvency
This is a wellknown fact that should have been clear to everyone involved in the euro creation
Issing admits that he was among those who believed that tarting monetary union without having established a political union was putting the cart before the horse 
The European Union was brought into existence stepbystep by putting the cart before the horse setting limited but politically attainable targets and timetables knowing full well that they would not be sufficient and thus that further steps would be required in due course
But for various reasons the process gradually ground to a halt
The EU is now largely frozen in its current shape
The same applies to the euro
The crash of  revealed the flaw in the euro construction as each member country had to rescue its own banking system instead of doing it jointly
The Greek debt crisis brought matters to a climax
If member countries cannot take the next steps forward the euro may fall apart with adverse consequences for the EU
The original construction of the euro postulated that each member would abide by the limits set by the Maastricht Treaty
But previous Greek governments egregiously violated those limits
The Papandreou government elected in October  with a mandate to clean house revealed that the budget deficit reached  of GDP in  shocking both the European authorities and the markets
The European authorities accepted a plan that would reduce the deficit gradually but the markets were not reassured
The risk premium on Greek government bonds continues to hover around three percentage points depriving Greece of much of the benefit of euro membership  namely being able to refinance government bonds at the official discount rate
With the risk premium at current levels there is a real danger that Greece may not be able to extricate itself from its predicament regardless of what it does because further budget cuts would further depress economic activity reducing tax revenues and worsening the debttoGDP ratio
Given that danger the risk premium will not revert to its previous level in the absence of outside assistance
The situation is aggravated by the market in credit default swaps which is biased in favor of those who speculate on failure
Being long CDS the risk automatically declines if they are wrong
This is the exact opposite of shortselling in equity markets where being wrong means that the risk automatically increases
Recognizing the need the last Ecofin meeting has for the first time committed itself o safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole
But Ecofin has not yet found the mechanism for doing so because the current institutional arrangements do not provide one  although the Lisbon Treaty establishes a legal basis for it
The most effective solution would be to issue jointly and separately guaranteed eurobonds to refinance say  of the maturing debt as long as Greece meets its agreedupon targets leaving Greece to finance the rest of its needs as best it can
This would significantly reduce the cost of financing and it would be the equivalent of the IMF disbursing its loans in tranches as long as conditions are met
But this is politically impossible at present because Germany is adamantly opposed to serving as the deep pocket for its profligate partners
Therefore makeshift arrangements will have to be found
The Papandreou government is determined to do whatever is necessary to correct the abuses of the past and it enjoys a remarkable degree of public support
There have been mass protests and resistance from the old guard of the governing party but the general public seems ready to accept austerity as long as it sees progress in correcting budgetary abuses  and there are plenty of abuses to allow progress
So makeshift assistance will be sufficient to allow Greece to succeed but that leaves Spain Italy Portugal and Ireland
Together they constitute too large a portion of the euro zone to be helped out by makeshift arrangements
The survival of Greece still leaves the future of the euro in question
Even if the EU handles the current crisis what about the next one
It is clear what is needed more intrusive monitoring and institutional arrangements for conditional assistance
Moreover a wellorganized eurobond market would be desirable
The question is whether the political will to take these steps can be generated
The Greek Crisis and Beyond
NEW YORK  As eurozone leaders face growing uncertainty in financial markets about the public finances of Greece and other member countries their statements albeit somewhat vague underscore a much larger story  one that will force firms and investors to question their assumptions about Europe economic financial and political environment
Let first dispense with a powerful emerging myth
Greece troubles have encouraged some to wonder aloud if the euro zone can survive its growing internal imbalances
But such doubts ignore the political and cultural factors that buttress a deep European commitment to preserve the monetary union
The euro was created partly in order to bolster internal market efficiency and prevent currency volatility
But it is also the product of a deeprooted European conviction that transnational institutions and economic interdependence have helped establish and sustain peace across the continent for the past six decades
In a world of weak multilateral institutions ncluding a G beset by substantial differences of opinion on basic questions  it is more important than ever that eurozone governments bolster their collective clout in an uncertain unprecedented and competitive global environment
For member states the euro zone is simply too important to fail
That means that solutions to the many problems they now face will require adjustment to the way each of them taxes and spends
Yet from one government to the next the result will be massively uneven  a recurring problem during Europe multidecade drive for internal currency stability
This divergence on fiscal policy has many causes and no single shock will alter it
Understanding the increased importance of fiscal policy is complicated by confusion over how various eurozone governments actually make policy decisions  a process that relies on an everchanging complex mix of opaque institutional factors and domestic political dynamics that vary considerably from one country to another
In an era in which transparency and disclosure are the prevailing norm in most aspects of European governance the politics of fiscal policy still look like conference diplomacy circa 
This is Europe new reality not a momentary lapse in good order
Companies and investors exposed to risk in Europe must assume much more volatility in interest rates within the euro zone and increasingly uneven growth and inflation prospects
The convergence of sovereign debt yields implied and required by the establishment of the common currency need not return
The absence of a stable framework will force investors to rethink assetallocation decisions and risk pricing
As the bond market begins finally to price in greater relative risk in eurozone sovereigns the intellectual underpinnings of the idea of a global division between emergingmarket and developedmarket bonds will be fundamentally tested
These shifts will be gradual persistent and less predictable than what investors had come to expect during the deceptive calm of the euro first decade when the currency union establishment together with EU enlargement and liberalization appeared to create a stable and benign environment
Finally remarkable and lasting policy shifts will not be limited to countries in immediate financial trouble
German fiscal policy could soon look very different from the zerodeficit bias that prevailed under the grand coalition that governed from  until 
During that period the deficitreduction camps within both the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats made common cause to fend off pressures from other factions within their respective parties for a change in policy
That structure is no more
Today the right wants tax cuts and the left now reconstituting itself may push for higher spending
No one believes that Germany is at risk of default but investors overlook this sort of policy shift at their own risk
After all a significant change in policy direction within the euro zone biggest economy could have a much larger effect on the currency union than developments in Greece
Given internal conflict over taxes and spending maybe Germany not Greece will become the euro zone first country to see a government fall
The Greek Tragedy Act II
CHICAGO  A Greek tragedy is typically composed of three acts
The first sets the scene
It is only with the second that the plot reaches its climax
For currentday Greece the imposition of oluntary losses on the country private creditors represents just the end of the beginning
The real tragedy has still to unfold
On the face of it the oluntary arrangement with creditors might appear to have been a big success
The volume of Greece foreign debt has been reduced by more than  billion  billion
Greece European partners have provided  billion in new loans
As a result Greece has avoided generalized bank failures and it has been able to continue paying its public employees
But despite these trumpeted results the reality is much harsher
Even with the latest deal Greece debt ratio remains at  of last year GDP
With a projected drop in GDP of  this year and a sustained deficit the debt ratio would exceed  before stabilizing at  in 
But even this reduced level is not sustainable
With its population set to contract by  annually over the next  years even if per capita income in Greece were to rise at the German rate of  per year the debt would be difficult to service
Assuming that Greece could borrow at a real interest rate of only  the current level is  the government would need to run an annual ofGDP primary budget surplus the fiscal balance minus debtservice costs for the next  years just to keep the debt burden stable
To put that task in perspective in the last  years Greece ran an average primary deficit of  per year
To reduce the debttoGDP ratio to  Greece would have to maintain an average primary surplus of  for the next  years a level that it has temporarily achieved in only four of the last  yearsnbsp
If the situation is so dramatic why are the European Union and the International Monetary Fund celebrating the recent agreement
Simply put these institutions primary objective was to minimize the repercussions that a Greek default would have on the international financial system
Greece frankly was not their priority
Given the reaction in financial markets they have succeeded
The delay in reaching an agreement enabled most private creditors to escape the consequences of their reckless lending to Greece
Roughly half of Greece external debt migrated from the private sector to official institutions
But the group of lenders that the EU and the IMF wanted to help the most  the banks  only partly reduced their exposure
Between May  and September  the value of Greek sovereign debt held by French banks dropped by  billion  while German banks reduced their holdings by  billion  and Italian banks by  million 
In part this drop reflects the reduction in market value of the existing liabilities
Thus on average banks have sold very little
But while privatesector losses have been minimized at what price
Had Greece defaulted on its debt in  imposing the same aircut on private creditors as it has imposed now it would have reduced the debttoGDP ratio to a more manageable 
That would have been painful but it could have spared the Greeks from a  decline in GDP and a rise in unemployment to  including an increase in youth unemployment to a whopping 
More importantly a default in  would have left some room for adjustments
Under the current plan there is none if the economy does not turn around quickly Greece will need more help
But where can it go now to find it
Most of the sovereign debt is now held by the official sector which traditionally does not allow any haircut
The remainder has been reissued under English not Greek law putting it outside of the control of the Greek government and its new collectiveaction clause which facilities partial defaults
In other words Greece has exhausted its ability to share part of the burden with the private sector
Next time Europe taxpayers will be on the hook
The second act of the Greek tragedy will cast desperate Greeks against angry and disenchanted Europeans elsewhere
Only at the climax will we know whether the effort to delay the inevitable contributed to undermining the idea of Europe for the current generationnbsp
The Green Guevara
olivia is rich a Tacana Indian woman told me last week inside Madidi National Park
Earlier in the day we witnessed a hundred capuchin and squirrel monkeys rush down from the Amazon jungle canopy and were now relaxing beside Lake Chalalan while her cousin a shaman blessed coca leaves as the evening traditional drumming and dancing began
This is Chalalan Lodge a wholly Indianowned and operated ecotourism outfit through which a hundred indigenous families lifted themselves out of poverty  while creating benefits worth a half million dollars for the Bolivian economy each year
It is one of dozens of similar operations  from the world largest salt flats in the south to Lake Titicaca in the west to the eastern Pantanal wetlands  that combine economic growth with conservation
It seems improbable that such enterprises should exist in Bolivia a fragile democracy and the hemisphere poorest place next to Haiti
As the December  presidential elections approach the frontrunners could not look much different from one another
In first place is Evo Morales an Amayra Indian running under the Movement Toward Socialism banner who is sometimes seen as Che Guevara second coming
Running behind vo is Jorge uto Quiroga a millionaire former IBM executive from the Europeandescended Bolivian elite he is closely aligned with America Republican Party and is married to a Texas blonde named Ginger
Tuto warns that should Evo win he might consolidate a Latin American axisofevil connecting a leftist Bolivia with Fidel Castro Cuba and Hugo Chvez Venezuela
Evo counters that Tuto is too linked to Bolivia corrupt political establishment  one of the most dishonest in the world according to the watchdog group Transparency International  to do much for Bolivia twothirds Indian majority
Whichever man wins will face Bolivia seemingly intractable pair of ills socialexclusion and poverty
It a combination that has led to the overthrow of two presidents in the last three years
Workable solutions will lie not in ideology but rather in capitalizing on what the nation has to offer to the global economy its stock of pristine ecology
Noel Kempff for example one of Bolivia national parks is home to the worlds biggest forestbased Kyoto Protocol experiment
The park contains the biggest chunk of virgin cerrado habitat left on Earth with tapirs red brocket deer silvery marmosets and pumas living amid twenty waterfalls crashing off the Huanchaca Mesa into forests
The park waterways contain onetenth of the world remaining  giant river otters along with black and speckled caiman pink river dolphins and capybaras
The  Chiquitanos living around the park contend that a tree holds up the Amazon seven skies and they are living that belief in a modern way by using their forests to help reduce the stratospheric greenhouse gasses that cause global warming
British Petroleum and American Electric Power the largest electricity supplier in the United States have helped the Chiquitanos buy up logging concessions thereby doubling Noel Kempff to three million acres
The firms earn capandtrade carbon credits to fulfill their Kyoto requirements
Bolivia Indians have also used their ecoclout to convince the energy companies to bankroll their fight for a acre homeland bordering Kempff
It now pays for nature to stay as the locals earn their neotraditional living by ranching oxygen traded on the Chicago Climate Exchange CCX and through shipping certified timber and organic palmhearts to Chile and Europe
Bolivia destroys the myth that Third World countries are too poor to be green and casts serious doubt on the famous nvironmental Kuznets Curve  the theory that environmental quality correlates with wealth
Bolivia track record is remarkable the world first debtfornature swap the world largest protected dry tropical forest experimental Indian park management a rapidly growing protectedareas system a National Environmental Fund a world leader in international efforts to protect the endangered vicuna progressive forestry legislation a national biodiversity conservation agency and a total ban on trade in domestic species
Conservation resonates with local political parties
On the left Evo delivers homilies exalting Pacha Mama or Mother Nature on the right Tuto favors market mechanisms like Kyoto over command and control
Both candidates want jobs to be created in ecological services
Regardless of who comes to power the West should channel a larger portion of the billions of dollars in development aid each year including the newly approved  million for the country from the UN Millennium Challenge Account to foster a local spirit of natural capitalism instead of providing charity
The Indianrun lodge I visited is part of a  million ecological tourism industry that has been growing at  a year precisely because of the country natural splendor
Economists argue that should the current trickle of  visitors each year grow to a quite reasonable million every Bolivian would be employed
olivia is where Costa Rica was  years ago an ecotourism expert told me at the first national summit on the industry on the shores of Lake Titicaca
Finally the Bush administration must ratify the Kyoto Protocol in order to allow both global firms and Bolivian community entrepreneurs to create yet more rainforest ranches and other creative initiatives that reduce poverty harbor biodiversity and cool a warming world
Perhaps Bolivia is indeed rich  in a way that could benefit all of us well into the future
The Green Inquisition
COPENHAGEN  When it comes to global warming extreme scare stories abound
Al Gore for example famously claimed that a whopping six meters  feet of sealevel rise would flood major cities around the world
Gore scientific advisor Jim Hansen from NASA has even topped his protg
Hansen suggests that there will eventually be sealevel rises of  meters  feet with a sixmeter rise happening just this century
Little wonder that fellow environmentalist Bill McKibben states that e are engaging in a reckless driveby drowning of much of the rest of the planet and much of the rest of creation
Given all the warnings here is a slightly inconvenient truth over the past two years the global sea level hasn increased
It has slightly decreased 
Since  satellites orbiting the planet have measured the global sea level every  days with an amazing degree of accuracy   millimeters  inches
For two years sea levels have declined
All of the data are available at sealevelcoloradoedu
This doesn mean that global warming is not true
As we emit more CO over time the temperature will moderately increase causing the sea to warm and expand somewhat
Thus the sealevel rise is expected to pick up again
This is what the United Nations climate panel is telling us the best models indicate a sealevel rise over this century of  to  centimeters  inches with the typical estimate at  centimeters one foot
This is not terrifying or even particularly scary   centimeters is how much the sea rose over the last  years
Simply put wee being forcefed vastly overhyped scare stories
Proclaiming six meters of sealevel rise over this century contradicts thousands of UN scientists and requires the sealevel rise to accelerate roughly fold from today
Imagine how climate alarmists would play up the story if we actually saw an increase in the sealevel rise
Increasingly alarmists claim that we should not be allowed to hear such facts
In June Hansen proclaimed that people who spread isinformation about global warming  CEOs politicians in fact anyone who doesn follow Hansen narrow definition of the ruth  should literally be tried for crimes against humanity
It is depressing to see a scientist  even a highly politicized one  calling for a latterday Inquisition
Such a blatant attempt to curtail scientific inquiry and stifle free speech seems inexcusable
But it is perhaps also a symptom of a broader problem
It is hard to keep up the climate panic as reality diverges from the alarmist predictions more than ever before the global temperature has not risen over the past ten years it has declined precipitously in the last year and a half and studies show that it might not rise again before the middle of the next decade
With a global recession looming and high oil and food prices undermining the living standards of the Western middle class it is becoming ever harder to sell the highcost inefficient Kyotostyle solution of drastic carbon cuts
A much sounder approach than Kyoto and its successor would be to invest more in research and development of zerocarbon energy technologies  a cheaper more effective way to truly solve the climate problem
Hansen is not alone in trying to blame others for his message becoming harder to sell
Canada top environmentalist David Suzuki stated earlier this year that politicians omplicit in climate change should be thrown in jail
Campaigner Mark Lynas envisions Nurembergstyle nternational criminal tribunals against those who dare to challenge the climate dogma
Clearly this column places me at risk of incarceration by Hansen amp Co
But the globe real problem is not a series of inconvenient facts
It is that we have blocked out sensible solutions through an alarmist panic leading to bad policies
Consider one of the most significant steps taken to respond to climate change
Adopted because of the climate panic biofuels were supposed to reduce CO emissions
Hansen described them as part of a righter future for the planet
But using biofuels to combat climate change must rate as one of the poorest global olutions to any great challenge in recent times
Biofuels essentially take food from mouths and puts it into cars
The grain required to fill the tank of an SUV with ethanol is enough to feed one African for a year
Thirty percent of this year corn production in the United States will be burned up on America highways
This has been possible only through subsidies that globally will total  billion this year alone
Because increased demand for biofuels leads to cutting down carbonrich forests a  Science study showed that the net effect of using them is not to cut CO emissions but to double them
The rush towards biofuels has also strongly contributed to rising food prices which have tipped another roughly  million people into starvation
Because of climate panic our attempts to mitigate climate change have provoked an unmitigated disaster
We will waste hundreds of billions of dollars worsen global warming and dramatically increase starvation
We have to stop being scared silly stop pursuing stupid policies and start investing in smart longterm RampD Accusations of rimes against humanity must cease
Indeed the real offense is the alarmism that closes minds to the best ways to respond to climate change
The Green Paradox
The protesters have returned to their home countries the injured are licking their wounds the heads of state are back to business as usual and Heiligendamm the old spa on Germany Baltic coast is resuming its dream of imperial beauty
And German Chancellor Angela Merkel achieved a substantial diplomatic success
With charm and unassuming clearheadedness she wrought a compromise from the G countries that may help save the world from the most severe devastations caused by global warming
The world eight richest countries promised to eriously consider halving their CO emissions by 
The wording may sound vague but given the positions the countries held at the outset the outcome was an important achievement
The United States in particular shifted its stance significantly since its rejection of the Kyoto Protocol even accepting that the United Nations will have to organize the future negotiations
But while the compromise is more than could have been hoped for at the outset several important countries did not partake of it
To be sure China India Brazil South Africa and Mexico signed on but many countries including the Asian tigers and most European countries did not despite their large contributions to polluting the world atmosphere
Moreover the oil sheiks and other producers of fossil fuels who ultimately control the amount of carbon released to the atmosphere were not part of the deal
If major consumer countries and most producer countries do not join the agreement to reduce CO emissions it could be useless
Many believe that aggregate CO emissions are the result of independent decisions in individual countries
Thus if a group of countries decides to have lower emissions worldwide emissions will decline by the sum of these countries reductions
Sure it would be better if all countries curtailed their emissions but it is already a great help if at least some countries do so
Unfortunately this view is too good to be true because one country emissions are not independent from those of another
If countries decide to cut their emissions they will have to reduce their consumption of fossil fuels in particular oil
This will reduce the world price of these fuels inducing other countries to consume even more than they otherwise would
Countries that cut their emissions would in effect be subsidizing their competitors growth not necessarily reducing the speed of global warming
The sacrifices of the participating countries would alleviate the CO problem only if their restraint meant that some of the fossil resources they do not consume remain underground
They must succeed in inducing the oil sheikhs and other producers of fossil fuels to throttle their pumps
If the sheikhs are stubborn and continue to extract as much as they had planned to extract without the G restraint the price of fuels will fall sufficiently to induce so much extra consumption among the nonparticipating countries that the net effect on aggregate CO emissions will be nil
Will the oil sheikhs reduce output of fossil fuels
At first glance it seems natural to assume this as most suppliers reduce production when the price falls
But the sheikhs are sitting on fixed stocks of oil
If they do not extract it today they will have to do it in the future if they want to make a profit
At best it seems that the time path of extractions can be tilted toward the future
This would not solve the CO problem in the long run but at least it would postpone the catastrophe
The oil sheikhs would likely be inclined to postpone extraction only if they could reasonably assume that the demand reductions of the signing countries and the comparative price reduction that this implies are stronger today than they will be in the future
This is not plausible
Indeed the sheikhs will know that in all likelihood concerns about global warming will increase over time
They will therefore speed up rather than reduce production in order to avoid selling their oil when anxiety about CO peaks and the artificial measures of the signing countries to reduce their consumption have dampened the oil price most
Thus green policies will paradoxically accelerate rather than mitigate global warming
Two lessons arise from these considerations
First all polluters must sit at the negotiating table and be forced or induced to participate in reducing pollution
The commitments of single countries like Germany to overfulfill their duties are useless
Germany has already contributed threequarters of the aggregate EUwide reductions of CO emission from  to  to which the EU committed in the Kyoto protocol
Such a policy simply subsidizes other polluters CO emissions but does not alleviate the problem of global warming
Second and more difficult the oil sheikhs and other producers of fossil fuels must be talked into postponing their extraction plans or better yet not to extract some of their resources at all
The best policy against global warming is to keep the CO imbedded in fossil resources deep underground
The good news from Heiligendamm is that the UN will now have to organize a common solution
The bad news is that this is unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future and that the owners of natural resources will therefore make every attempt to extract their resources and thus pump the fossil carbon into the atmosphere before the UN finds a way out of this impasse
The Green PseudoRevolution
COPENHAGEN  With a worldwide recession advancing strong action on global warming has been thrown into jeopardy
This matters because in little more than a year the world will sit down in Copenhagen to negotiate the followon treaty to the failed Kyoto Protocol
Yet with people losing jobs and income immediate economic help seems to matter more than temperature differentials  years from now
Many green pundits have however started saying that the financial crisis only makes the need for action on climate change greater
They urge America presidentelect Barack Obama to pursue a reen revolution with big investments in renewable energy arguing that this could create millions of new reen collar jobs and open huge new markets
Such sentiments no surprise are strongly voiced by business leaders who live off such subsidies
But are such pleas smart investments for society
The problem with the green revolution argument is that it doesn trouble itself about efficiency
It is most often lauded for supplying new jobs
But billions of dollars in tax subsidies would create plenty of new jobs in almost any sector the point is that many less capitalintensive sectors would create many more jobs for a given investment of taxpayers money
Similarly green initiatives will open new markets only if other nations subsidize inefficient technologies bought abroad
Thus the real game becomes which nations get to suck up other nations taxfinanced subsidies
Apart from the resulting global inefficiency this also creates a whole new raft of industry players that will keep pushing inefficient legislation simply because it fills their coffers
A good illustration is Denmark which early on provided huge subsidies for wind power building thousands of inefficient turbines around the country from the  onwards
Today it is often remarked that Denmark is providing every third terrestrial wind turbine in the world creating billions in income and jobs
A few years ago however the Danish Economic Council conducted a full evaluation of the wind turbine industry taking into account not only its beneficial effects on jobs and production but also the subsidies that it receives
The net effect for Denmark was found to be a small cost  not benefit
Not surprisingly the leading Danish wind producer is today urging strong action on climate change that would imply even more sales of wind turbines
The company sponsors the lanet in Peril show on CNN which helps galvanize public pressure for action
The crucial point is that many green technologies are not costeffective at least not yet
If they were we wouldn need to subsidize them
The standard reply is that green technologies seem more expensive only because the price of fossil fuels does not reflect their climate costs
That makes some sense
Given that fossil fuels contribute to global warming standard economic theory suggests we should tax them according to their cumulative negative effects
But this would make little difference to the inefficiency of most green technologies
The most comprehensive economic metastudy shows that total future climate impacts justify a tax of  per liter of petrol  per gallon in the US
This is dwarfed by the tax that many European countries already impose and it is much less than in the European trading system
Yet it is argued that much higher taxes and subsidies are the best way to increase research and development in new cheaper renewable energy sources
This is untrue
During the massive investment associated with the Kyoto treaty the participating countries investment in RampD as a percentage of GDP has declined  not increased
It is rather obvious that if you invest massively in inefficient solar panels most of your money will go to buy the physical panels whereas only a very small part will go to RampD If you want more RampD you should spend your money directly on RampD This could tackle global warming in the longer run
Finally it is often claimed that high CO taxes and subsidies for green technology will actually do good and again Denmark is often taken as an example
After all it is argued Denmark has kept its CO emissions flat while enjoying  economic growth since 
But could it have grown more if it had not restricted CO emissions
During the same period US emissions grew  but its GDP grew  more than Denmark indicating a simple truth CO cuts and subsidies don necessarily mean no growth but they probably do mean slower growth
Presidentelect Obama is now facing countless people who claim that subsidies for renewable energy and CO taxes are great ways to tackle global warming and forge a new green economy
Unfortunately this is almost entirely incorrect
Taxes and subsidies are always expensive and will likely impede growth
Moreover if we really want to tackle global warming we shouldn spend vast sums of money buying inefficient green technology  we should invest directly in RampD to make future green technology competitive
Obama should seize the initiative and make the meeting in Copenhagen next year not about bloated subsidies for inefficient technologies but about lean investments in future breakthroughs
That is the way to tackle global warming and support a genuinely vibrant economy
The Green Shoots of the Green Economy
NAIROBI  In just two years the idea of a reen Economy with its links to sustainable development and poverty eradication has gone from being an interesting idea to being among the top two issues at the upcoming UN Conference on Sustainable Development or Rio
Many people may wonder whether the Green Economy is just pleasing jargon or a genuinely new pathway to a lowcarbon resourceefficient and sustainable twentyfirst century
Is it the fundamental departure from the development models of the past that its advocates proclaim or just another case of the emperor new environmental clothes
Perhaps the answer can be found in some of the extraordinary transitions taking place in the electricity and energy sectors around the world
Many people for example scoff at the idea that solar power could be anything but a niche market for enthusiasts or a costly white elephant overhyped by environmental dogooders
In  one private equity fund estimated that annual installations of solar photovoltaic PV arrays might reach  gigawatts GW by 
In fact  GW was installed in  up  from 
And PV installations are forecast to rise further this year by perhaps GW taking global capacity to around  GW  the equivalent of around  nuclear reactors
All of this is not happening only in developed economies like Germany Spain and the United States but in countries like Bangladesh Brazil China India Mexico and Morocco
Indeed according to an estimate by IMS Market Research more than  countries will be part of this emerging solar revolution by 
None of this has come about by chance
Some countries have moved early to embrace the energy dimension of a Green Economy and have introduced the necessary public policies and incentives
Considerable manufacturing capacity has been added which has halved costs over the past two years
In fact PV prices are set to halve again this year
A nuclear power plant can take  years to build and a coalfired power station around five years
Midsize solar plants of  negawatts however are now taking only about three months to get from the planning stage to construction
With the advent of smart grids and freemarket pricing solar PV seems well positioned to provide solutions that are quick to build and scalable
The International Energy Agency estimates that to achieve universal access to electricity by  around  billion in additional annual investments in the power sector will be needed
That sounds like a lot of money especially in the wake of the economic and financial crisis that is still troubling large parts of the world
But new investment just in solar PV was around  billion in 
Multibilliondollar investments also flowed into new wind farms geothermal plants and a host of other renewableenergy technologies
The green shoots of a Green Economy are emerging across the power sector driven by concerns about climate change air pollution and energy security  as well as by the desire to generate new kinds of competitive employmentgrowing industries
They can also be seen in the growth of recycling industries in South Korea or the way Indonesia is factoring forests into its social and economic planning
The challenge for Rio is to agree on a range of forwardlooking policies that can be deployed in part or in whole to accelerate all of this up
At the UN Environment Program upcoming Governing CouncilGlobal Ministerial Environment Forum in Nairobi Kenya we will launch a landmark contribution to this debate with the release of A Transition to a Green Economy
The report analyzes how a global investment of  of global GDP in the Green Economy could unleash economic growth and positive social outcomes while keeping humanity planetary footprint within sustainable boundaries
In particular the catalytic choices for ten sectors  from agriculture fisheries and forests to transport and buildings  are as relevant to developing as they are to developed countries
And they are as relevant to stateled as they are to more marketdriven economies
There will always be those who smile skeptically at the mere notion of a Green Economy and dismiss such farreaching transitions
It is time to put the numbers on the table and show how advances in solar power alone are starting to prove them wrong
The Greening of Bush
The United States is usually regarded as an environmental laggard with President George W Bush perceived as being little better than the head of a gang of willful polluters who do everything they can to obstruct global action to protect the environment
Of course there is some truth in this characterization of America and quite a lot in that of Bush but the picture is not uniformly bleak
Indeed the environmental movement  like most modern social movements  began in the US
The roots of America nvironmental movement lie in the nineteenth century when the damage wrought by the industrial revolution and the fragmentation of the natural landscape by individual property rights and tenures first became apparent
But it was the publication in  of the book Silent Spring  a polemic against the use of pesticides in agriculture  by the biologist Rachel Carson that jumpstarted the modern ecological movement
Carson drew on scientific findings but also voiced fundamental misgivings about consumer capitalism and a ostmaterialistic belief in the primacy of the quality of life over economic growth
In Carson wake the oodstock generation of the  with its Earth Days soon began to organize a broad campaign which saw in April  around  million Americans take to the street to defend the environment
In this new movement the libertarian tendencies of the New Left and the protectionist tendencies of the traditional right became intertwined
Paul Ehrlich bestseller The Population Bomb exerted an influence that lasts to this day
America environmental movement was soon exported to Europe and elsewhere on one hand the pragmatic Friends of the Earth and the mediaoriented organization Greenpeace  and on the other hand ecofundamentalist groups like Earth First and the Environmental Justice Movement EJM or lobbying groups like the World Wildlife Fund
This movement managed to force the first environmental laws out of the conservative Nixon administration the National Environmental Act of  the Clean Air Act of  the Clean Water Act of  and the Endangered Species Act of 
Then as now the focus in America was on reen topics clean water fresh air and biological diversity rather than with the rown topics of ecological disasters such as the Chernobyl or Harrisburg disaster which have played a dominant role in mobilizing Europeans
America influential Environmental Protection Agency EPA also was established under Nixon
Environmentalists hired scientists lawyers and lobbyists who made sure that laws weren just passed in Congress but also implemented in practice
But the current Bush administration has been hacking away at these  laws from all directions
He approved oil exploration in closed nature reserves and also systematically fought to suppress scientific evidence on climate change
Now however due to the surge in crude oil prices even Bush has had to begin to consider alternative energy sources and it won be possible to limit these to nuclear power or ethanol which is so popular among farmers a key Bush constituency
Indeed even Bush own political base the Christian fundamentalists are becoming reen pressuring the administration to sign the Kyoto Protocol because they believe that the environment must be protected just like unborn life
cotheology and evangelical prolife propaganda have become one of the liveliest branches of the US environmental movement
reen ecoactivists while feeling awkward about support from this quarter nonetheless find them useful allies
Indeed the greening of America is becoming a general proposition
Many Americans can only shake their heads at the energy lobbyists who surround Bush and VicePresident Dick Cheney and for a long time now a majority has been in favor of signing multilateral agreements particularly in the area of climate protection
Catastrophic events like Hurricane Katrina have reinforced this stance
All this has caused Bush to seek to accommodate  verbally at least  the will of an overwhelming majority of Americans to conserve energy
Moreover although Bush has given mainly national security reasons for his seeming change of heart America federal system helps the country get around even a roadblock as powerful as the president as ocalism promotes ecopolitical initiatives at the state level and even within municipalities
It is not just California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger who has recognized the signs of the times and proclaimed bold Kyoto targets for his state that may become a pacemaker of AllAmerican modernization again
Political climate change has also been brought about by people like Jerome Ringo the president of the National Wildlife Federation NWF  whose  million members make it one of the largest environmental organizations
Ringo also heads the Apollo Alliance  a coalition of trade unions environmentalist groups managers and local politicians that demands clean energy and good jobs
How green America will actually become remains to be seen of course but as an ecological avantgarde the US might even regain its lost influence in the world
Those who disdain environmental concerns have been ousted at the polls in large numbers companies invest huge amounts in environmental technologies states are suing car producers for their climateadverse policies and the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol have long been surpassed by some states  a lesson for German and European cities and municipalities
As in the past the effectiveness of these initiatives ultimately will depend on whether these impulses reach Europe and Japan as well as emerging nations like China and Brazil
It is time for Greens everywhere to start attending to ecological matters again  and strange as it may sound to look again to America for inspiration
The Greening of China
Two countries  the United States and China  remain aloof from global efforts to create a new postKyoto framework on climate change
Fifty years ago the rest of the world might have carried on with remedying the problem of conventional and greenhouse gas emissions and let China and the US stew in their own waste
But the world is now so interdependent that what happens in one place affects all others
For example visitors and residents alike have long thought of Hong Kong as a beautiful city clinging to the South China coast
But for at least five years Hong Kong citizens have found themselves starting to cough and wheeze from the city increasingly degraded air
Corporate employers are even complaining about not being able to attract overseas talent
Pollution from Hong Kong own power generation plants growing number of vehicles and burgeoning shipping industry can certainly be reduced
But the lion share of this industrial haze  like the growing pollution of its coastal waters  is a direct result of the rapid industrialization of the Pearl River Delta across the border in China Guangdong Province
China is exporting not only more and more goods but also its environmental degradation
The inescapable truth is that the futures of Hong Kong and China are integrally linked
There are roughly  factories in the Pearl River Delta with Hong Kong connections and together they employ more than  million workers
Guangdong accounts for about  of China total foreign trade while Hong Kong is China international finance center
Officials in both Hong Kong and Guangdong are powerless to clean up their environmental problems on their own
In fact development plans in China may be heading in the opposite direction
Political heavyweights in Guangdong still favor a form of development that relies on speed and quantity while ignoring overall environmental quality
And Hong Kong economic blueprint also focuses on accelerating large infrastructure projects whose environmental impact has not been rigorously examined
It will not be easy for leaders on either side of the border to reverse gears but there is still chance that people and companies can make a difference
Increasingly loud complaints about deteriorating air quality have goaded Hong Kong and Guangdong into embarking on a joint program in which a series of monitoring stations now provides emissions data
Hong Kong data have been released regularly and in  Guangdong data were made publicly available for the first time
There is now also talk about monitoring water quality
These are laudable steps for China given its poor record on transparency
Indeed the joint airmonitoring network provides a foundation for the region to develop a sophisticated regional air management program
Furthermore new coalfired power plants may no longer be allowed on either side of the border necessitating greater use of natural gas and renewable energy sources
The first challenge for authorities is to regulate power generation very differently
People are used to paying for the electricity that they actually use
But to optimize efficiency utilities need to be rewarded for what they help consumers save
In other words utilities must be given incentives to help consumers use less power
This idea is clearly feasible
Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute has proposed what he calls the egawatt or energy that is never used
All that is needed are the right financial incentives to induce utility companies to produce less electricity and still be more profitable and consumers to reduce their use and gain savings without sacrificing comfort
This can be done by refitting households with highefficiency light bulbs and other technological improvements and by retrofitting industrial plants with energysaving technologies
Another innovative idea that Hong Kong and Guangdong are exploring is the E scheme
To help industries in the region upgrade environmentally firms can now obtain special loans for which the Asian Development Bank assumes the risk  a program made possible by Hong Kong sound banking practices
Another initiative worth watching is the Hong Kong stock exchange exploratory project to offer a trading platform for emissions derivatives which will most likely include conventional pollutants as well as carbon
The exchange will undertake a study this summer with trading to begin as early as 
If these reforms are not trumped by efforts to maintain high growth at all costs the region could not only clean itself up while continuing to prosper but could also establish a model for all of China
Nothing is more necessary in a country that according to the United Nations Development Program contains  of the world  most polluted cities
Hong Kong leaders to do not want to end up on that infamous list
By saving themselves they may also be able to play an instrumental role in saving China
The Greening of Growth
NAIROBI  The G summit in Toronto offers an opportunity for a long hard look at how green investments are assisting economic recovery and job growth in many countries while generating environmental gains as well including on climate change
China which channeled around onethird of its stimulus package into environmental sectors has seen its GDP rise sharply and employment in renewable energies such as solar has climbed to more than  million with  workers added in  alone
Spain unemployment rate is high but it would undoubtedly be higher without its policy to foster wind power and other cleantech sectors in which a halfmillion jobs have been created
South Korea has invested well over  of its stimulus in areas ranging from sustainable transport and lowemission vehicles to energyefficient buildings
This has now been backed up with a fiveyear greengrowth plan aimed at cutting carbon dependency while producing  million jobs
India National Rural Employment Guarantee Act is assisting to repair and restore a range of rural infrastructure critical for the livelihoods of the poor including waterstorage networks in some of the poorest parts of the country such as Andhra Pradesh
It is delivering improved water security a  increase in wages for agricultural workers and more than  billion days of work with the program as a whole reaching  million families per year on average
The city of So Paulo which represents around onethird of Brazil economy is embarking on a Green Economy strategy that ranges from transport to greener buildings
While a transition to a lowcarbon resourceefficient economy is gaining traction globally some claim either that it is merely a glossy repackaging of the sustainabledevelopment agenda or worse a plot to constrain rather than liberate growth in developing and leastdeveloped countries
In either case it is an agenda favored by developed or rapidly emerging countries which poorer economies cannot afford
None of this could be further from the truth
In advance of the G we have assembled some key case studies  part of a major Green Economy report to be published later in the year
In Kenya we found that a new greenenergy policy including a feedin tariff and year powerpurchase agreement is catalyzing an initial target of  megawatts of geothermal wind and biofuel power and a rise of more than  in the country installed capacity
In Uganda policies to promote organic agriculture have generated  certified farmers and strong export growth from under  million in  to nearly  million now
And in Thailand market mechanisms backed by ambitious targets are helping the country produce businesses that are regional leaders in waste recycling including operations now in Laos and Malaysia while generating thousands of jobs
Over the past two years the Green Economy has gone from theory to practice
It is now one of the two major themes as governments prepare for the Rio conference in Brazil in 
The inherent logic offers perhaps for the first time a sustainable growth paradigm that is suited to developing and developed countries alike
New ideas and policies especially when they challenge the status quo will always have their critics
But as multiple case studies demonstrate many developing economies are making up their own minds
The Green Economy is not a luxury but a clear imperative on a planet of six billion people  and nine billion by The financial and economic crisis has given it wings
How far it will fly will depend on smart policies by national governments in developed and developing countries and on forwardlooking policies by regional development banks the World Bank the International Monetary Fund and bilateral development finance by OECD countries
The G summit in Toronto has the opportunity if not the responsibility to enable this transition by taking a leadership role in support of developing economies aspirations
Its leaders should reaffirm their commitment to embed sustainability in the global economic recovery and their recognition of the Green Economy power to create a fundamentally different development path for all countries
The Greening of New York
In the coming days the United States will make a critical decision that has the potential to change America standing in the world whether to approve a  million grant that will help make New York City the first environmentally sustainable megacity in the twentyfirst century
Officials at the US Department of Transportation must appreciate that their decision to fund Mayor Michael Bloomberg visionary project called PlaNYC will determine the quality of air that more than  million New Yorkers breathe daily and the amount of carbon dioxide emissions the city coughs into the atmosphere
Already New York City produces more CO emissions than all of Norway
More importantly officials must realize that their actions will shape America response to the global challenge of unparalleled urbanization and carboninduced climate change
This year for the first time in human history more people will live in urban areas than rural communities
In the US the urban population has grown from  million in  to  million in 
Today nearly  of Americans live in urban areas
Such unprecedented and unplanned urbanization wreaks environmental havoc by increasing carbon emissions since higher population density results in greater automobile and energy use
PlaNYC encourages the use of public transportation systems by creating powerful disincentives to automobile use
The plan proposed congestion charge on automobile use during peak times in certain parts of the city would reduce traffic and generate revenue that would go toward improving public transportation
Mayor Bloomberg plan comes at the right time for a city burdened by worsening traffic and pollution problems
Vehicles cause nearly a fifth of New York City CO emissions
Traffic congestion in particular is not only environmentally detrimental it also imposes substantial time and resource costs on drivers
Americans lose around  billion hours and  billion gallons of fuel sitting in traffic jams
This implies an annual cost of around  billion
Due to congestion New Yorkers face the longest commutes in the US and their children have the highest rate of asthma hospitalization
PlaNYC would impose the congestion charge on the  of New York City residents who drive to work while its benefits would accrue to everyone
New Yorkers would enjoy cleaner air shorter average commuting time and better public transportation
Neither the economy in general nor the retail sector in particular should be adversely affected
In fact service and delivery providers in Manhattan among others would benefit from shorter travel times and fewer delays
However despite its many advantages congestion charges face some skepticism
Fortunately we can learn from other cities such as Stockholm Singapore and London which have successfully implemented them
In all of these cities CO emissions declined sharply and congestion was significantly reduced with Singapore experiencing an immediate  drop in traffic
These cities have also benefited from more efficient public transportation
In London bustravel rose by 
According to an independent report almost  of the businesses in London judged the program impact on the economy as positive or neutral
Automobile dependent countries like America need smart solutions to ensure environmentally sustainable development
Having one of the largest urban populations and the highest per capita CO emissions the US has the responsibility  and the means  to lead the world on this front
If the US does not act soon American cities will lag behind not only European capitals but also developing country cities such as Bogota Colombia and Curitiba Brazil which are already implementing innovative environmentally friendly solutions
New York City has always been a global leader in finance the arts and many other fields
It is an ideal candidate for creating a blueprint for cleaner and more efficient urbanization in the US and the world
The Greening of Work
MONACO  When environment ministers from some  countries meet here on February  for UNEP Governing Council and Environmental Forum talks will focus on environmentally friendly reen growth and ways and means by which the world can achieve a lowcarbon economy
The employment and development potential of combating climate change is only now being understood as a part of this effort
UNEP has invited the International Labour Organization and the International Trade Union Confederation to contribute to these discussions
Changes underway are a result of the Kyoto Protocol but they are also partly being made in anticipation of deeper emission cuts to come
Equally important the perception of organized labor and industry concerning environmental issues is changing dramatically
Environmental regulation was sometimes viewed with suspicion and concern for business and labour
Now business sees profits and unions see jobs
Consider these facts
A Washingtonbased consulting firm estimates that the US environmental industry generated more than  billion in sales and almost  billion in tax revenues in 
The  million workers in the environmental industry outnumber pharmaceutical workers ten to one
A British company specializing in improving the energy efficiency of homes was floated on the London Stock Exchange last June and now employs  people who once worked in nearby now closed coal mines
A study prepared for the German Ministry of Environment estimates that employment in the German environmental technology industries will surpass employment in the automobile industry by 
China has some  solar thermal energy firms generating sales of  billion and employing  workers in manufacturing and installation
The Indian city of Delhi is introducing new ecofriendly compressed natural gas buses which will create an additional  new jobs
These trends look set to continue
The United Nations Environment Programme Sustainable Energy Finance Initiative estimates that investment in renewable energy has reached  billion worldwide or  of new investment in the power sector
The Initiative which involves some  financial institutions also estimates that market financing for clean and renewable energies could reach  trillion by 
International efforts are now beginning to bear fruit
The Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol could channel  billion in funds from North to South for investment in carbon offsetting projects such as renewable energy schemes and tree planting
The Bali conference last year agreed to include avoided deforestation in tropical countries into a new climate regime which could generate new employment opportunities in sustainable management conservation and tourism
Several countries including Costa Rica Norway and New Zealand have pledged carbon neutrality which in turn will require investment and employment in carbonfriendly sectors
Significantly labor is adding to the effort
At Bali the global trade union movement signaled its commitment to an  reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions by  underlining the perceived value of environmentally sustainable development and a future in reen jobs
These jobs will play a vital role in reducing the environmental footprint of economies and promoting sustainable production and consumption patterns
In a rapidly greening labor market those jobs lost to environmental unsustainability will have to be replaced by just transitions involving the promotion of social security economic diversification and retraining
Yet green jobs are not enough
Meeting the challenge of climate change will require a new development model that combines reduced emissions with a better future for the vast majority of people and the opportunity to earn a living in a decent job
Last month President Hu Jintao of China called for the realization of sustainable development and decent work by advancing conomic globalization in the direction of balanced development shared benefit and winwin progress and to make sure that international economic trade and financial institutions provide favorable conditions  so that the st century is genuinely a century of development for all  to realize sustainable development and for the vast majority of workers to enjoy decent work
Clearly change is in the air
Our responses to climate change must have a social dimension
Workers employers and governments must engage in dialogue to put in place the social policies which ensure that green jobs are decent jobs
Only in this way can the poor and the jobless from Marseille to Mumbai and Sao Paulo to Shanghai be optimistic that creating an environmentallysustainable world will also deliver decent environmentallysustainable work
The Blurry Frontiers of Economic Policy
MILAN  Around the world policies technologies and extended learning processes have combined to erode barriers to economic interaction among countries
Pick any indicator trade relative to global GDP capital flows relative to the global capital stock and so forth  all are rising
But economic policies are set at the national level and with a few notable exceptions like trade negotiations and the tracking of terrorist funding and money laundering policymakers set goals with a view to benefiting the domestic economy
And these policies or policy shifts are increasingly affecting other economies and the global system giving rise to what might be called olicy externalities  that is consequences that extend outside policymakers target environment
Of course such externalities have always existed
But they used to be small
As they grow more significant the result of greater global connectedness they inevitably become harder to manage
After all global optimization would require a global policymaking authority which we do not have
These external effects are particularly consequential in the financial sector owing to the potential for large and relatively abrupt changes in capital flows asset prices interest rates credit availability and exchange rates all of which have powerful effects on output growth and employment
The economic crisis and its aftermath is a case in point
Defective growth models in advanced countries based on excess credit and domestic aggregate demand and complicated by structural flaws and limited adjustment mechanisms in Europe led to instability a crisis and a large negative shock to the real economy
Emerging economies were immediately affected by credit tightening including trade finance and rapid declines in exports leading to similar shocks there
Advanced countries moved to prevent a downward spiral using monetary and fiscal policy tools
These too had external effects but at least in the short run the medicine distortions in capital markets was generally considered less damaging than the disease economic collapse in the advanced economies
This was followed by an extended version of the assistedgrowth model in the advanced countries largely revolving around unconventional monetary policy in the United States this implied several rounds of quantitative easing which is simply the government borrowing from itself  a form of price control
Savers were repressed in order to lower the costs of credit for debtors including governments and those seeking to borrow for business expansion
This did not work very well because investment was constrained by deficient domestic aggregate demand relative to capacity
So savers did what one would expect seek higher riskadjusted returns in emerging economies causing increases in credit and fueling upward pressure on exchange rates and asset prices
This obvious externality required policy responses in the emerging countries limits on capital inflows reserve accumulation and measures to restrict credit and restrain assetprice inflation
Complaints from emergingmarket policymakers about the distortionary effects of the advanced countries policies were largely ignored
All of that has changed dramatically since May when the US Federal Reserve began signaling its intention to aper its massive monthly purchases of longterm assets
Asset prices shifted and capital rushed out of emerging markets causing credit conditions to tighten and exchange rates to fall
At a minimum a shortterm growth slowdown is nearly certain some wonder whether the destabilizing impact of capitalflow reversals will have longerterm adverse effects
For the most part the latter fear appears overblown though the risks caused by unexpected policy shifts and related financial adjustments should not be underestimated or dismissed
The emerging economies generally have the policy instruments balance sheets and expertise to respond effectively
In addition while China output is affected by advancedcountry economic performance its financial system is largely insulated from monetarypolicy externalities
The capital account is less open foreigncurrency reserves of  trillion mean that the exchange rate is controllable and with savings exceeding investment the currentaccount surplus is declining but still positive China is not dependent on foreign capital
China systemic importance with respect to emergingmarket growth its relative stability and other emerging countries domestic policy responses suggest that the main effect of the Fed coming policy shift will be a new equilibrium with less distorted asset prices
This should create opportunity for investors especially if there is a downward overshoot as the new equilibrium emerges
Some level of policy coordination might be achieved by an earlywarning system which would provide sufficient time for an organized response
But multilateral communication of significant policy shifts would almost inevitably result in leaks and confidencedamaging insider trading
Given an expanded mandate and a much larger balance sheet the International Monetary Fund with advance notification could in principle reliably act to stabilize volatile international capital flows buying time for more orderly domestic responses
But that would be a rather large step in the direction of global economic governance and management
Decentralized policy and growing externalities will result in partial deglobalization especially in macroeconomic configurations finance and capital accounts
Thus it is not a good idea to run persistent currentaccount deficits and become dependent on temporarily lowcost foreign capital
Open capital accounts may be replaced not by whimsical ad hoc interventions that heighten uncertainty and weaken confidence but rather by predictable rulesbased constraints on financialcapital flows
Second as we learned from the crisis substantial domestic ownership of the banking sector is crucial in part because multinational resolution mechanisms in cases of insolvency are largely nonexistent
Moreover the pattern of accumulating reserves via currentaccount surpluses net private capital inflows or both  a legacy of the  Asian financial crisis  will continue and perhaps become even more pronounced
Finally public purchases of domestic assets to stabilize asset prices and net capital flows will become increasingly common
We are in the process of learning how to manage growing policy interdependence without much policy coordination
The challenge is to identify policy circuit breakers that have relatively high benefitcost ratios
Time and experience will help  that is so long as high volatility does not destabilize many economies in the interim
Missing America
BERLIN  Madeleine Albright the former US secretary of state once described the United States as the ndispensable nation
Current developments around the world are proving her right
But the proof has been almost entirely negative Today America importance has become apparent from the absence of US leadership in one crisis after another an absence that is most immediately obvious in Syria
In fact a postAmerican world is taking shape before our eyes characterized not by a new international order but by political ambiguity instability and even chaos
This is unfortunate and could turn out to be so dangerous that even diehard antiAmericans end up longing for the pass American century and the US role as a global force for order
Both subjectively and objectively the US is no longer willing or able to play that role
There have been many causes a decade of war in the greater Middle East with its enormous cost in lood and treasure the financial and economic crisis high public debt reorientation toward internal problems and a new focus on Pacific affairs
Add to this America relative decline in view of China ascendance and that of other large emerging countries
I am relatively certain that the US will successfully manage its reorientation and realignment but the relative weight and reach of its power will nonetheless decline in the new world of the twentyfirst century as others grow in strength and catch up
Certainly America global role will not be called into question
China will be busy addressing its own internal contradictions for a long time yet
Nor is India or Russia likely to pose a serious challenge
And Europe din of conflicting voices appears to preclude it from claiming America mantle
But while none of these powers represents a serious alternative to America global role the US will no longer be able to act unilaterally as it did after the Cold War end and it will be weakened substantially
This change has become particularly obvious in the Middle East and the AsiaPacific region
In the Middle East the regional order created by the colonial powers France and Britain following World War I was maintained throughout the Cold War and the brief era of unilateral US domination that followed the convulsions of recent years however could well bring about its end
The colonial borders are being called into question and what will become of Syria Lebanon Iraq and Jordan is difficult to forecast
The potential for regional disintegration and reconstitution  a process that can unleash untold violence as in Syria  is greater than ever
Moreover while there is no new regional hegemon to follow America there are numerous contenders for the role
But none  Iran Turkey and Saudi Arabia being the most prominent  is strong enough to decide matters in its own favor
Given the lack of a new force for order in the region in the foreseeable future and the old one unwillingness to act the danger of longlasting violent confrontation is growing
Even if America once again pursued military intervention in the region its power would no longer be sufficient to enforce its will
Indeed it is precisely because the US after more than a decade of war understands this only too well that any American administration will think twice before intervening militarily in the region again
Things look different in Asia where the US not only remains present but has increased its commitments
In East and South Asia nuclear powers China Russia India Pakistan and North Korea or nearnuclear powers Japan and South Korea are all entangled in dangerous strategic rivalries
Add to this a regular dose of North Korean irrationality
While the US presence in the region has so far prevented its numerous conflicts and rivalries from intensifying sources of uncertainty are multiplying
Will China be wise enough to seek reconciliation and partnerships with its neighbors large and small rather than aiming for regional domination
What will become of the Korean Peninsula
And what implications does Japan nationalist turn  and its risky economic policy  hold for the region
Can India and China stem the deterioration in bilateral relations
Is state failure looming in Pakistan
Imagine this situation without America military and political strength
The region would be dramatically more dangerous
At the same time America straitened resources mean that its new global role will require more careful consideration of national interests in setting priorities
Clearly the AsiaPacific region takes precedence in US calculations
This new more focused and limited American role thus raises the following question for America European partners Can they afford the luxury of being unable to defend themselves without US help
Certainly America guarantee of its NATO allies security will not become worthless but it will become far more difficult to redeem it in full
And if a postAmerican world entails greater risk of chaos and its consequences than hope for a new stable order  a risk that affects Europe in particular  then perhaps Europe should reverse course on its apparent determination to dismantle itself
Too Big To Handle
WASHINGTON DC  In the discussion of whether America largest financial institutions have become too big a sea change in opinion is underway
Two years ago during the debate about the DoddFrank financialreform legislation few people thought that global megabanks represented a pressing problem
Some prominent senators even suggested that very large European banks represented something of a role model for the United States
In any case the government according to the largest banks CEOs could not possibly impose a cap on their assets size because to do so would undermine the productivity and competitiveness of the US economy
Such arguments are still heard  but increasingly only from those employed by global megabanks including their lawyers consultants and docile economists
Everyone else has shifted to the view that these financial behemoths have become too large and too complex to manage  with massive adverse consequences for the wider economy
And every time the CEO of such a bank is forced to resign the evidence mounts that these organizations have become impossible to manage in a responsible way that generates sustainable value for shareholders and keeps taxpayers out of harm way
Wilbur Ross a legendary investor with great experience in the financial services sector nicely articulated the informed privatesector view on this issue
He recently told CNBC
 think it was a fundamental error for banks to get as sophisticated as they have and I think that the bigger problem than just size is the question of complexity
I think maybe banks have gotten too complex to manage as opposed to just too big to manage
In the wake of Vikram Pandit resignation as CEO of Citigroup John Gapper pointed out in the Financial Times that iti shares trade at less than a third of the multiple to book value of Wells Fargo because the latter is a teady predictable bank whereas Citigroup has become too complex
Gapper also quotes Mike Mayo a leading analyst of the banking sector iti is too big to fail too big to regulate too big to manage and it has operated as if it too big to careven Sandy Weill who built Citi into a megabank has turned against his own creation
At the same time top regulators have begun to articulate  with some precision  what needs to be done
Our biggest banks must become simpler
Tom Hoenig a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and now a top official at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation advocates separating big banks commercial and securitiestrading activities
The cultures never mesh well and big securities businesses are notoriously difficult to manage
Hoenig and Richard Fisher the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas have been leading the charge on this issue within the Federal Reserve System
Both of them emphasize that oo complex to manage is almost synonymous with oo big to manage at least within the US banking system today
George Will a widely read conservative columnist recently endorsed Fisher view 
Big banks get a big taxpayer subsidy  in the form of downside protection for their creditors
This confers on them a funding advantage and completely distorts markets
These subsidies are dangerous they encourage excessive risktaking and very high leverage  meaning a lot of debt relative to equity for each bank and far too much debt relative to the economy as a whole
Now these themes have been picked up by Dan Tarullo an influential member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
In an important recent speech Tarullo called for a cap on the size of America largest banks to limit their nondeposit liabilities as a percentage of GDP  an entirely sensible approach and one that fits with legislation that has been proposed by two congressmen Senator Sherrod Brown and Representative Brad Miller
Tarullo rightly does not regard limiting bank size as a panacea  his speech made it clear that there are many potential risks to any financial system
But in the oftennuanced language of central bankers Tarullo conveyed a clear message the cult of size has failed
More broadly we have lost sight of what banking is supposed to do
Banks play an essential role in all modern economies but that role is not to assume a huge amount of risk with the downside losses covered by society
Ross got it right again this week when he said
 think that the real purpose and the real need that we have in this country for banks is to make loans particularly to small business and to individuals
I think that the hard part to fill
He continued
ur capital markets are sufficiently sophisticated and sufficiently deep that most large corporations have plenty of alternative ways to find capital
Smaller companies and private individuals don have really the option of public markets
Theye the ones that most severely need the banks
I think theye kind of lost track of that purpose
Hoenig and Fisher have the right vision
Tarullo is heading down the right path
Ross and many others in the private sector fully understand what needs to be done
Those who oppose their proposed reforms are most likely insiders  people who have received payments from big banks over the past year or two
Robbing the Roma
BUDAPEST  A year and a half has passed since the European Commission adopted the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to  which calls upon European Union governments to create comprehensive plans aimed at strengthening social inclusion and improving the wellbeing of their Romani citizens
The European Council endorsed the framework soon after
But despite good intentions little has changed
In fact the Roma suffering has increased as a result of the euro crisis and intolerance has intensified especially in the countries with the largest Romani populations  Romania Hungary Bulgaria Slovakia the Czech Republic and Greece
Despite the European Commission call for member states to apply more EU funds to programs aimed at integrating Roma before the close of the  EU budget period none of these six countries has done so
Some of them  such as Bulgaria and Romania  are among the most laggard spenders of EU funds particularly resources from the European Social Fund
For example Romania has received  billion  billion from the ESF
But the estimated  million Roma in the country  who struggle with pervasive unemployment poor living conditions low life expectancy and low rates of school attendance  have benefited very little from these funds
Indeed in the sixth year of the current sevenyear budget cycle less than  of the funds have been used and only a fraction of that for Roma
The little that was set aside for Roma is now in jeopardy given that the EU has suspended its ESF reimbursements to the Romanian government owing to procedural shortcomings
As a result the government is not reimbursing NGOs that are trying to implement programs aimed at helping Roma
Circumstances are not much better elsewhere
The Bulgarian government is spending EU funds very slowly
And in Hungary spending slowed when the current government deemed the previous government programs deficient
Adverse political incentives in Central and Eastern Europe are partly to blame for this situation
The prevailing view in these countries is that Roma prefer stealing and damaging others property to working that they receive disproportionate and undeserved social benefits and that they produce children in order to qualify for more public assistance
Fearing shortterm damage to their popularity politicians  even those who understand the longterm implications of their failure to act  are wary of helping Roma
The problem is further exacerbated by a political culture in which public officials private interests trump genuine leadership
Indeed the EU most corrupt memberstate governments are those that need to do most for their Romani citizens
In Hungary the extremenationalist Jobbik party has been capitalizing on antiRoma sentiment
Supported by roughly  of the population the party had some success in the latest European Parliament elections as well as in national and local polls
For example last year Jobbik candidate Oszkar Juhasz was elected Mayor of Gyongyospata where a radical paramilitary organization had staged patrols for two weeks in protest against ypsy crime
And in October Jobbik Erik Flp won his second consecutive mayoral election in Tiszavasvari the party proclaimed apital city
Likewise last June in Baia Mare Romania the incumbent mayor Catalin Chereches won more than  of the vote on a promise to eliminate the town ockets of poverty  or more accurately to demolish Romani neighborhoods
The city had already captured the world attention when it erected a sixfoothigh wall to isolate a particularly poor Romani community of roughly  people from its neighbors effectively creating a ghetto
Such actions reflect a dangerous trend toward physical exclusion
Under communism significant efforts were made to assimilate Roma they were given jobs albeit at the bottom of the economic pyramid and were assured housing
With postcommunist restructuring this modest status evaporated
Their diminished social status combined with openly discriminatory hiring policies by private companies resulted in the Roma rapid reisolation
To reverse this trend Western European countries too must take responsibility
After all it was France thenpresident Nicolas Sarkozy who in  ordered the expulsion of illegal Roma and the demolition of their camps  triggering the humanrights response that stimulated the EU to strengthen its calls for investment in Roma integration
The European Commission despite its flaws remains the Roma greatest institutional hope
Given the existing framework lack of impact a stronger set of recommendations for member states is being discussed
EUlevel action must become more systematic and consequential so that the Commission can exert a greater influence on member states
In particular the traditional disbursement mechanisms for cohesion funds must be reassessed in countries where the state bureaucracy is unable to administer them effectively
Cutting the post EU budget thus reducing the funds allocated for cohesion policy is not the answer
Furthermore communication between EU bureaucrats and Romani NGO leaders must improve so that they can work together to change social policies in EU countries that ignore or harm not only Roma but all of their poor citizens
To this end the Commission must improve oversight of the expenditure and nonexpenditure of EU funds and civilsociety groups must learn how to lobby rather than simply air grievances
Isolation of and discrimination against Roma not only undermines European values it threatens to unravel the social fabric in Europe new democracies
With support from civil society the European Commission remains the agent of change that can and must lead EU members toward a future in which all citizens have the opportunity to improve their lives
The time has come for Europe to get serious about systematically solving the centuriesold problem of Roma exclusion
The Threat to the CentralBank Brand
NEW YORK  The randing of modern central banking started in the United States in the early  under thenFederal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker
Facing worrisomely high and debilitating inflation Volcker declared war against it  and won
In delivering secular disinflation he did more than change expectations and economic behavior
He also greatly enhanced the Fed standing among the general public in financial markets and in policy circles
Volcker victory was institutionalized in legislation and practices that granted central banks greater autonomy and in some cases formal independence from longstanding political constraints
To many central banks now stood for reliability and responsible power
Simply put they could be trusted to do the right thing and they delivered
As any corporate executive will tell you brands can be consequential drivers of behavior
In essence a brand is a promise and powerful brands deliver on their promise consistently  be it based on quality price or experience
In some cases consumers have been known to act on the strength of brand alone even purchasing a product with relatively limited knowledge about it
Indeed brands send signals that facilitate the task at hand
In some special cases  think of Apple Berkshire Hathaway Facebook and Google  they have also acted as a significant catalyst for behavioral modification
In the process they often insert a wedge that essentially disconnects fundamentals from pricing
Building on Volcker success Western central banks have used their brand to help maintain low and stable inflation
By signaling their intention to contain price pressures they would alter inflation expectations  and thus essentially convince the public and the government to do the heavy lifting
In the last few years however the threat of inflation has not been an issue
Instead Western central banks have had to confront market failures fragmented financial systems clogged monetarypolicy transmission mechanisms and sluggish growth in output and employment
Facing greater challenges in delivering desired outcomes they have essentially pushed both policies and their brand power to the limit
This is apparent in central banks aggressive emphasis on communication and forward policy guidance
Both have been used more widely  indeed taken to extreme levels  to supplement the unconventional expansion of balance sheets in the context of liquidity traps
Now corporate executives will also tell you that brand management is a tricky affair
It is particularly hard to maintain or control your brand when popular sentiment overshoots
This is what happened to Apple stock this year
As brilliantly explained by Guy Kawasaki in his book on the company the brand essentially created nchantment
Extrapolating this into a market view that Apple could not only innovate continuously but also fend off any and all competitors investors took the company share price to dizzying heights
Elsewhere in California Facebook found its brand fueling enormous hype for the company initial public offering
Encouraged by investor excitement and indications of oversubscription underwriters hiked the IPO price well above what they had first deemed reasonable
Issuing the stock to the public at an inflated price a year ago the shares initially traded even higher
In both of these cases and in many others brand power did more than lead to price behavior that was disconnected from fundamentals it also caused a dangerous overshoot which when subsequently reversed damaged the brand
However powerful brands cannot divorce pricing from fundamentals entirely and forever
Accordingly and despite a significant market rally that has taken many individual stocks to record highs Apple and Facebook currently trade at almost half their record levels
Their dominance and influence are no longer unquestioned
Western central bankers should spend some time reflecting on these experiences
Some have actively encouraged markets to take the prices of many financial assets to levels no longer warranted by fundamentals
Others have stood by passively
Indeed it seems that only retiring central bankers such as Mervyn King of the Bank of England are willing to raise concerns publicly
This behavior is understandable
Central bankers are basically hoping that financialmarket hype by itself can help pull fundamentals higher
The idea is that price action will trigger both the ealth effect and nimal spirits thus inducing consumers to spend more and companies to invest in future capacity
Count me among those who worry about this situation
Far from a world of optimal policy central bankers have been forced into prolonged reliance on imperfect approaches
From my professional vantage point I sense a mounting risk of collateral damage and unintended consequences
Market signals are more distorted fueling resource misallocations
Investors are piling on more risk at increasingly elevated prices
Fundamentalsbased investing is giving way to a frantic search for relative bargains in an increasingly overpriced financial world
All this will not matter much if central banks live up to their reputation as responsible and powerful institutions that deliver on their economic promises
But if they do not  essentially because they are not getting the required support from politicians and other policymakers  then the downside will involve more than just disappointed outcomes
They will have materially damaged their standing and consequently the future effectiveness of their policy stance
By extending well beyond their comfort zone today central banks face unusual brandmanagement risks
Their prior ability to deliver on promises and expectations has made today financial markets take the forward pricing of the economy to levels that exceed what central bankers alone can reasonably deliver
The implication is not that central banks should immediately halt their hyperactivism and unconventional measures
It is that they should be much more open about the inherent limitations of their policy effectiveness in current circumstances
Western central bankers need to become much more vocal and one hopes more persuasive in placing pressure on politicians and other policymakers
Otherwise risking major brand damage they will end up adding yet another item to an alreadyoverloaded plate of challenges for the next generation

Two Dollar Fallacies
CAMBRIDGE  The United States current fiscal and monetary policies are unsustainable
The US government net debt as a share of GDP has doubled in the past five years and the ratio is projected to be higher a decade from now even if the economy has fully recovered and interest rates are in a normal range
An aging US population will cause social benefits to rise rapidly pushing the debt to more than  of GDP and accelerating its rate of increase
Although the Federal Reserve and foreign creditors like China are now financing the increase their willingness to do so is not unlimited
Likewise the Fed policy of largescale asset purchases has increased commercial banks excess reserves to unprecedented levels approaching  trillion and has driven the real interest rate on tenyear Treasury bonds to an unprecedented negative level
As the Fed acknowledges this will have to stop and be reversed
While the future evolution of these imbalances remains unclear the result could eventually be a sharp rise in longterm interest rates and a substantial fall in the dollar value driven mainly by foreign investors reluctance to continue expanding their holdings of US debt
American investors fearing an unwinding of the fiscal and monetary positions might contribute to these changes by seeking to shift their portfolios to assets of other countries
While I share these concerns others frequently rely on two key arguments to dismiss the fear of a run on the dollar the dollar is a reserve currency and it carries fewer risks than other currencies
Neither argument is persuasive
Consider first the claim that the dollar status as a reserve currency protects it because governments around the world need to hold dollars as foreign exchange reserves
The problem is that foreign holdings of dollar securities are no longer primarily oreign exchange reserves in the traditional sense
In earlier decades countries held dollars because they needed to have a highly liquid and widely accepted currency to bridge the financing gap if their imports exceeded their exports
The obvious candidate for this reserve fund was US Treasury bills
But since the late  countries like South Korea Taiwan and Singapore have accumulated very large volumes of foreign reserves reflecting both exportdriven growth strategies and a desire to avoid a repeat of the speculative currency attacks that triggered the  Asian financial crisis
With each of these countries holding more than  billion in foreignexchange holdings and China holding more than  trillion  these are no longer funds intended to bridge tradebalance shortfalls
They are major national assets that must be invested with attention to yield and risk
So although dollar bonds and increasingly dollar equities are a large part of these countries sovereign wealth accounts most of the dollar securities that they hold are not needed to finance trade imbalances
Even if these countries want to continue to hold a minimum core of their portfolios in a form that can be used in the traditional foreignexchange role most of their portfolios will respond to their perception of different currencies risks
In short the US no longer has what Valry Giscard dstaing as France finance minister in the  accurately called the xorbitant privilege that stemmed from having a reserve currency as its legal tender
But some argue that even if the dollar is not protected by being a reserve currency it is still safer than other currencies
If investors don want to hold euros pounds or yen where else can they go
That argument is also false
Large portfolio investors don put all of their funds in a single currency
They diversify their funds among different currencies and different types of financial assets
If they perceive that the dollar and dollar bonds have become riskier they will want to change the distribution of assets in their portfolios
So even if the dollar is still regarded as the safest of assets the demand for dollars will decline if its relative safety is seen to have declined
When that happens exchange rates and interest rates can change without assets being sold and new assets bought
If foreign holders of dollar bonds become concerned that the unsustainability of America situation will lead to higher interest rates and a weaker dollar they will want to sell dollar bonds
If that feeling is widespread the value of the dollar and the price of dollar bonds can both decline without any net change in the holding of these assets
The dollar real tradeweighted value already is more than  lower than it was a decade ago notwithstanding the problems in Europe and in other countries
And despite a more competitive exchange rate the US continues to run a large currentaccount deficit
If progress is not made in reducing the projected fiscal imbalances and limiting the growth of bank reserves reduced demand for dollar assets could cause the dollar to fall more rapidly and the interest rate on dollar securities to rise
Democracy in Arabia
PARIS  In Democracy in America Alexis de Tocqueville argued that the public trust alleviates pressure on the state allowing it to function more effectively
This should give some comfort to governments in the Arab world where a  survey of young people showed  of the respondents expressing greater trust in their governments
But what then accounts for the continuing civil turmoil and government paralysis in the ArabSpring countries
A more recent version of the survey provides some clues
A large majority of Arab youths around  say that they are most influenced by parents family and religion whereas only about a third report that elite groups  writers business leaders community leaders and media outlets  have any influence on their outlook on life
Indeed just  reported that pop stars influenced their outlook
These figures provide some useful insights into the evolving social fabric of Arab societies
Normally people are open to influence from those whom they trust and wish to emulate
The fact that a large majority of Arabs turns to family and religion is highly revealing
Arab societies particularly those in turmoil are regressing to what another French social theorist mile Durkheim called echanistic solidarity
This is social solidarity that evolves along lines of kinship and religion underpinned by a sense of belonging to the same omogenous group
Durkheim contrasts this phenomenon with the more progressive rganic solidarity that evolves in modern societies according to people professional and functional relationships
In times of elevated risk real or perceived people begin to organize increasingly on the basis of homogenous identities
As a result echanistic solidarity grows stronger at the expense of rganic solidarity
The trend is often accelerated by the loss of jobs which often leads people to abandon their professional and functional identities in favor of identities based on ethnicity kinship or religion
In culturally diverse societies such as Iraq and Lebanon networks of social solidarity are based almost entirely on religious and ethnic affinity
In more homogenous societies such as Libya social solidarity tends to follow tribal and partisan lines
In Tunisia too there has been a similar regression to mechanistic types of solidarity organized around tribal regional and religious identities
A dramatic manifestation of the mechanistic pattern of solidarity is now emerging in Syria as well
While Syrians have been facing death violence and displacement for more than two years the international community has been busy debating the nature of the Syrian rebels
Left to its fate Syrian society began to disintegrate and reorganize on a sectarian basis
As the conflict intensified established professionbased identities began to disappear giving way to family regional and religious solidarities
Civilsociety and professional groups have been unable to respond in a way that maintains organic social cohesion owing to a lack of resources weak capacity or both
Mechanistic solidarity has emerged as a more effective means to mobilize people and resources
At the heart of the crisis is a strong element of indifference
For example the role of the Arab middle class has been notably muted in efforts to support Syrian refugees
The American actress Angelina Jolie highly publicized visits to Syrian refugee camps in Jordan and Turkey underscored the nearabsence of similar awareness campaigns by Arab celebrities
Indeed while millions of Arabs tune in weekly to watch and vote for their favorite singers on the Arabic version of The Voice and Arab Idol a fundraising campaign for the benefit of Syrian refugees has yet to be organized
By contrast TV channels with specific religious and sectarian affiliations have been very active including on social media in fundraising efforts
It is perhaps not surprising then that most Arab youth do not see role models beyond their close social circles
In short Arab countries are hemorrhaging social capital which can significantly derail economic recovery and statebuilding
As the Nobel laureate economist Kenneth Arrow argued in  uch of the economic backwardness in the world can be explained by the lack of mutual confidence
Against this background the recently announced Arab Stabilization Plan an Arabled privatesector initiative aimed at creating tens of thousands of jobs through largescale infrastructure investment is exactly the type of action needed to preserve social cohesion
International efforts led by the World Bank and other international donors have tended to focus on strengthening relations between the state and its citizens in order to achieve ocquevillian gains  that is operational democracy and effective government
But what is urgently needed is a strong complementary focus on job creation to preserve and foster Durkheim organic solidarity
The Gucci Archipelago
MOSCOW By following Western economic advice  devised in good faith to bring Russia to democracy and prosperity  Yeltsin and Co true to the national character created yet another form of dictatorship with the leader ensconced in the Kremlin utterly indifferent to his subjects wellbeing
The difference between todays Russia and the old Soviet Union is that the Gulag archipelago of labour camps has been shunted aside in favour of what can only be called a Gucci archipelago or a casino camp
Under communism Soviet citizens were locked in
Russian citizens under todays sham market economy are locked out locked out of the normal conditions of life out of decently paid jobs or what is even more common out of paid jobs altogether
Most importantly they are locked out of hope to overcome the everlasting Russian curse
Former prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin conveyed this dilemma in his usual lethargic way
By privatising state property we wanted things to be better but it still ended up ike always
Like always in Russia means a neverending gulagtype arrangement for the average Russian citizen
The power of the KGB was simply replaced by the power of corrupt private oligarchs and an even more morally bankrupt state apparatus
Nowadays the wellguarded marble facades of Russias often insolvent banks and businesses have assumed the role in domestic demonology once played by the frightening Big House on Lubyanka Square in Moscow where the KGB did its night work
Before  everyone was overwhelmed by the very real fear of losing your freedom now people are overwhelmed by the fear of having too much freedom
Those who are not up to the new challenges are dismissed with a shrug as leftovers from the past and chucked onto the dustbin of history a place overflowing with human refuse after years of communism
Inequality is said to be inevitable in the process of Russias Westernisation and most people accept this
No Western adviser ever suggested however that the coming of free markets did not require a rule of law with everyone equal before it and the development of sensible tax structures that provide for a public safety net
The distorted markets imposed on Russia by the new oligarchs created by Russias market deforms I refuse to let such monstrosities parade under the name of reform has brought the country back full circle
Today the old KGB Prime Minister Evgeny Primakov was a career denizen of this central institution of the SovietStalinist state and headed its successor body after communisms collapse has been given the ruling hand in a last bid to impose some sort of order
Primakovs battle against corruption directed primarily against the financial magnate and former minister for relations with the old Soviet nations like Ukraine Secretary Boris Berezovsky is sending a clear message we will punish the guilty and impose discipline on rich and poor alike
That battle is highly selective
For example those Central Bank figures who spirited billions of the countrys foreign exchange reserves out of Russia to a secret account in the British Channel islands remain strangely immune from worry
But Primakovs so far cautious smack of firm government weakened by the miserable condition of Russian state finances might yet fail in tranquilizing todays disillusioned Russian masses
The mushrooming growth of the Party Against Yids organized by Duma member General Makashov as well as frequent marches and demonstrations by fascist groups with ersatz swastika signs and black outfits suggests a hideous resemblance to preNazi Germany in the early s
The popularity of these new model Nazis grows in proportion to the despair incited by unpaid wages unheated apartments vanishing supplies of food and the increasingly ugly and public squabbles around the decrepit occupant of the Kremlin throne
Hungry and poor people are looking with hope at the leather clad welltrained and irondisciplined youth of these street gangs
These roving bands dont appear to spend their time and energy on acquiring money or receiving concessions or fighting for high positions
They are starting to ACT
These blackbrownred brigades dont just promise investigations and some sort of punishment for Russias privatized oligarchs and their allies in the bureaucratic den of thieves
Their agenda is a no nonsense hanging of the corrupt a restoration through state subsidies of industrial for large numbers of people jobs paying equal wages to everybody and stopping crime by clamping down hard on the streets
In short they seek to establish an iron poriadok order a magic soothing nostalgic notion in todays bankrupt and chaotic Russia
Within Russia historically there are only two forces that would seek to stand against this looming political plague the intelligentsia and the army
Parts of the intelligentsia however men like Berezovsky who was a renowned mathematician went into business and politics and discredited themselves
The army leadership men like General Lebed did something of the same thing
Murder in the ranks starvation and suicides in distant army bases runaway conscripts even the spectre of soldiers selling out their fellow soldiers to Chechyn kidnappers have become common in todays Russian military which now sullenly sees itself as disgraced
There is a third force still in play though much cursed abused misused but relied upon and hoped for  Western help
On March  the GorePrimakov Commission will hold fresh meetings that could determine whether or not the IMF approve another  billiondollar loan as well as lead to restructuring Russias debt after the default of last summer
Russias fate will in some ways be decided that day  it will either sink into more chaos and despair the streets increasingly ruled by brownblack fascist youth or Russia will receive a little breathing room maybe its last to find a viable course somewhere in between the extreme archipelagos of Gulag and Gucci
The Gulag of the Russian Mind
It is now  years since the failed coup of August  against Mikhail Gorbachev
At the time Gorbachev policies of perestroika and glasnost were seen by Soviet hardliners as a sellout of communist Russia to the capitalist West
But it is now clear that the KGB and the military who launched the coup were not defending the idea of communism
Instead they were protecting their idea of Russia imperial mission a notion that had given the Kremlin commissars greater control of the vast Russian empire and of Russia neighbors than any of the Tsars had ever enjoyed
Gorbachev reforms not only liberated ordinary Russians from the straitjacket of MarxismLeninism but also released the national aspirations of people who had been locked in the empire for centuries
Having seen the peoples of Central Europe free themselves from Soviet domination just two years before the constituent nations of the USSR were beginning to seek the same freedom for themselves
The Baltic republics of Estonia Latvia and Lithuania were the first to insist on traveling their own national path and have since linked their fate to Europe as members of the European Union and NATO
Others soon followed
By December  the Soviet empire was no more
But only the Baltics have secured the sort of independence dreamed of in 
Georgia which is both European and Asiatic teeters on the edge of instability
Traditionally Asian Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan have resumed the tribal forms of autocracy they practiced throughout the centuries
Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have in essence become their presidents wholly owned family fiefs
Ukraine break with Russia was perhaps the most wrenching both for those in the Kremlin nostalgic for imperial control and for ordinary Russians who see Ukraine as the wellspring of Russian civilization
The Orange Revolution of  which overturned a rigged presidential election proved that Ukraine was no longer a Malorossiya a small Russia an inferior and subordinate Slavic brother
Indeed that peaceful revolution led by Viktor Yushchenko and Yuliya Tymoshenko was a reminder of how enlightened Kievan Rus had been before it was forced to give way to the despotic princes of Moscow
Two years after the Orange revolt Yushchenko a politician who seems out of his depth has now accepted the Kremlin placeman Viktor Yanukovych the foe he had vanquished in  as his new prime minister
Nonetheless the Orange movement  now led by Yushchenko former partner and prime minister Tymoshenko  has not fully lost its way and still aims to preserve Ukraine as a truly independent and free country Malorossiya  for the majority of Ukrainians remains a thing of the past
Despite all these epochal changes Russians cannot accept the loss of their imperial role
The dream of empire is indeed the gulag that imprisons the Russian mind
Most Russians do not regard Europe approach to their country borders as a sign that they have at long last fully united with the civilization of which they are a part but as a source of insecurity
Something more is at work here than mere nostalgia
During the chaotic years of Boris Yeltsin presidency it was perhaps understandable that Russians regretted their loss of great power status
Something had to be blamed for their dire economic conditions
Yet under President Vladimir Putin with the economy growing robustly these feelings have hardened not diminished
Russians are reverting to the past  to the grand pronouncements of Russia as a unique great nation destined to rule the world
As before the advent of Gorbachev  indeed restoring a centuriesold tendency  Russians yet again believe that the people should be willing to forfeit their freedoms for the sake of the greatness of the state which wins wars and launches Sputniks
A free press free speech and free elections it is feared may diminish the brute power that is needed for Russia to assert itself
Russians have long boasted of their various unique forms of greatness first it was the holy Russian soul so superior to Western practicality
In the fifteenth century Moscow was declared a hird Rome the savior of spiritual Christianity
The seventeenth century united this spiritual mission with imperial expansion which eventually encompassed a landmass spanning  times zones
In the early twentieth century the imperial and spiritual mission became one as Russia became the bastion of world communism
All these forms of greatness however demanded that ordinary Russians accept their debasement and enslavement
Development is not seen as a means of improving people lives but as helping Russia prove itself to be superior to everybody else
So ultimately the material achievements of Russian development always come with a body count
Joseph Stalin industrialization killed millions  and became obsolete in only  years
Putin Russia doesn go in for mass killing yet it has not lost the country uperiority complex
For Russia elite a restaurant bill cannot be too expensive and one can never have enough bodyguards waiting out front for you
On a grander scale Putin Russia has become a great power in terms of energy production but that looks to be temporary as scant investment is being made to maintain and improve the oil and gas fields
What matters is selling the reserves and being rich now not finding more for later
So as always the trouble with Russia is that the state develops but society doesn
The good of the people is sacrificed for the good of the nation
The dream of great Russia remains the gulag of the Russian mind
Erdoan Is Not Turkey Only Problem
PRINCETON  Trkan Saylan was a trailblazing physician one of Turkey first female dermatologists and a leading campaigner against leprosy
She was also a staunch secularist who established a foundation to provide scholarships to young girls so they could attend school
In  police raided her house and confiscated documents in an investigation that linked her to an alleged terrorist group called rgenekon supposedly bent on destabilizing Turkey in order to precipitate a military coup
Saylan was terminally ill with cancer at the time and died shortly thereafter
But the case against her associates continued and became part of a vast wave of trials directed against opponents of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoan and his allies in the powerful Glen movement made up of the followers of the Islamic preacher Fethullah Glen
The evidence in this case as in so many others consists of Microsoft Word documents found on a computer that belonged to Saylan foundation
When American experts recently examined the forensic image of the hard drive they made a startling  but for Turkey all too familiar  discovery
The incriminating files had been placed on the hard drive sometime after the computer last use at the foundation
Because the computer had been seized by the police the finding pointed rather directly to official malfeasance
Fabricated evidence secret witnesses and flights of investigative fancy are the foundation of the show trials that Turkish police and prosecutors have mounted since 
In the infamous Sledgehammer case a militarycoup plot was found to contain glaring anachronisms including the use of Microsoft Office  in documents supposedly last saved in 
My fatherinlaw is among the more than  officers who were locked up and my wife and I have been active in documenting the case fabrications
The list of revelations and absurdities goes on and on
In one case a document describing a plot directed against Christian minorities turned out to have been in police possession before the authorities claimed to have recovered it from a suspect
In another police iscovered the evidence that they were seeking despite going to the wrong address and raiding the home of a naval officer whose name sounded similar to that of the target
Yet none of the trials has yet been derailed
Most have had the support and blessing of Erdoan who has exploited them to discredit the old secular guard and cement his rule
Even more important the trials have had the strong backing of the Glen movement
Glen lives in selfimposed exile in Pennsylvania where he presides over a huge informal network of schools think tanks businesses and media across five continents
His devotees have established roughly  charter schools in the United States alone and the movement has gained traction in Europe since the first Glen school was founded in Stuttgart Germany in 
Back home Glen followers have created what is effectively a state within the Turkish state gaining a strong foothold in the police force the judiciary and the bureaucracy
Glenists deny that they control the Turkish police but as a US ambassador to Turkey put it in  e have found no one who disputes it
The movement influence within the judiciary ensures that its members transgressions remain unchallenged
In one welldocumented case a noncommissioned officer at a military base acting on behalf of the Glen movement was caught planting documents in order to embarrass military officials
The military prosecutor investigating the case soon found himself in jail on trumpedup charges while the perpetrator was reinstated
A senior police commissioner who had been close to the movement and wrote an expos about its activities was accused of collaborating with the farleft groups that he had spent much of his career pursuing he too ended up in jail
The Glen movement uses these trials to lock up critics and replace opponents in important state posts
The ultimate goal seems to be to reshape Turkish society in the movement own conservativereligious image
Glenist media have been particularly active in this cause spewing a continuous stream of disinformation about defendants in Glenmounted trials while covering up police misdeeds
But relations between Erdoan and the Glenists have soured
Once their common enemy the secularists were out of the way Erdoan had less need for the movement
The breaking point came in February  when Glenists tried to bring down his intelligence chief a close confidant reaching perilously close to Erdoan himself
Erdoan responded by removing many Glenists from their positions in the police and judiciary
But Erdoan ability to take on the Glen movement is limited
Bugging devices were recently found in Erdoan office planted his close associates said by the police
Yet Erdoan known for his brash style responded with remarkable equanimity
If he harbored any doubt that the movement sits on troves of embarrassing  and possibly far worse  intelligence the bugging revelation must surely have removed it
The foreign media have focused mainly on Erdoan behavior in recent months
But if Turkey has turned into a Kafkaesque quagmire a republic of dirty tricks and surreal conspiracies it is Glenists who must shoulder much of the blame
This is worth remembering in view of the movement efforts to dress up its current opposition to Erdoan in the garb of democracy and pluralism
Glenist commentators preach about the rule of law and human rights even as Glenist media champion flagrant show trials
The movement showcases Fethullah Glen as a beacon of moderation and tolerance while his Turkishlanguage Web site peddles his antiSemitic antiWestern sermons
Such double talk seems to have become second nature to Glenist leaders
The good news is that the rest of the world has started to see Erdoan republic for what it is an increasingly authoritarian regime built around a popular but deeply flawed leader
Indeed his government crackdown on dissent may well have cost Istanbul the  Olympics
What has yet to be recognized is the separate and quite disturbing role that the Glen movement has played in bringing Turkey to its current impasse
As Americans and Europeans debate the Glen movement role in their own societies they should examine Turkey experience more closely
The Gulf War at 
NEW YORK  It was  years ago this month that Saddam Hussein then the unchallenged ruler of Iraq invaded Kuwait
What ensued was the first great international crisis of the postCold War era one that in less than a year led to the liberation of Kuwait along with the restoration of its government
This was accomplished with only modest human and economic cost to the extraordinary multinational coalition assembled by President George HW Bush
Since then the United States has used military force numerous times for a range of purposes
Today the US is working to extricate itself from a second conflict involving Iraq trying to figure out a way forward in Afghanistan and contemplating the use of force against Iran
So the question naturally arises what can we learn from the first Iraq war one widely judged as a military and diplomatic success
One important lesson stems from the rationale for war
It is one thing to modify the behavior of a state beyond its borders but quite another to alter what takes place within another country territory
The  Gulf war was about reversing Iraq armed aggression something that was fundamentally inconsistent with respect for sovereignty the most basic of all rules governing relations among states in today world
Once Iraqi military forces were expelled from Kuwait in  the US did not march on Baghdad to replace Iraq government  or remain in Kuwait to impose democracy there
The  war against Afghanistan and the  war against Iraq were markedly different
Both interventions sought to oust the governments in place at the time and both succeeded in that goal
I maintain that the effort against Afghanistan was justified to remove the Taliban government that helped bring about the  attacks and that ousting Saddam Hussein was not
But regardless of one position on these questions it cannot be disputed that replacing a government with something better and lasting is a different and much more ambitious goal than changing a government behavior
Successful regime change requires a longterm commitment of military force of civilian experts trained to build a modern society and of money and attention  and even then there is no assurance that the results will justify the investment
Another set of lessons from the first Iraq war and the second as well suggests a limit to what can be expected from economic sanctions
Sanctions alone even those supported by the United Nations Security Council and backed by military force could not persuade Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait control of which was a major prize for him
Nor could sanctions trigger a change in government in Baghdad
Indeed over time their ability to bring results diminished
A third set of lessons concerns international support
The participation of many governments not only distributes the costs of going to war but also lends legitimacy to the enterprise
Multilateral backing can help sustain domestic approval or at least tolerance in the US and other countries including the one where the hostilities are taking place
So what do these lessons tell us about how to move forward in Iraq Afghanistan and Iran
In the case of Iraq President Barack Obama has repeated his pledge to end all US combat operations by the end of August and to withdraw all US military forces by the end of next year
But judging by Iraqi politicians inability to form a new government months after national elections their failure to provide essential services and above all the continuing deadly violence nationbuilding in Iraq is far from complete
The Obama administration may want to reconsider its commitment to leave and instead negotiate a new accord one that would allow as many as  US troops to stay in Iraq for years to come if and when a new Iraqi government emerges
In Afghanistan the lessons revolve around the nature of what is being sought
History suggests that the US ought to think twice before continuing its effort to remake Afghan society or its government
Instead the US would be wiser to limit itself to a narrower counterterrorism mission one akin to what is being done in Somalia and Yemen and to some extent in Pakistan
In the case of Iran the first Iraq war teaches us that economic sanctions will likely not be enough to persuade the Revolutionary Guards who increasingly dominate the country to accept verifiable limits on their nuclear program
Sanctions may however persuade some other powerful constituencies within Iran namely the clerics the businessmen of the bazaar and political conservatives to turn on President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his Revolutionary Guard base
But if not the question of whether to use military force to slow the development of an Iranian nuclear weapon will come to the fore
Only a few governments at most will support doing so
No one can predict or assume what a limited attack on Iran nuclear installations would accomplish cost or lead to
But not acting in effect accepting Iran nuclear might risks bringing about a more dangerous and possibly costlier future
As a result it is Iran even more than Iraq or Afghanistan where the lessons of the Gulf war are likely to be debated and ultimately applied
The Guns and Gold of August
CAMBRIDGE  China and Russia have just provided the world with sharp contrasts in the use of power
As the French analyst Dominique Moisi recently put it hereas China intends to seduce and impress the world by the number of its Olympic medals Russia wants to impress the world by demonstrating its military superiority  China soft power versus Russia hard power
Some American analysts such as Edward Luttwak have concluded that Russia invasion of Georgia proves the rrelevance of soft power and the dominance of hard military power
In reality the story will turn out to be more complicated for both countries
Soft power is the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion or payment
It is not the solution to all problems
North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il fondness for Hollywood movies is unlikely to affect his nuclear weapons program
And soft power got nowhere in dissuading Afghanistan Taliban government from supporting Al Qaeda in the 
But other goals such as the promotion of democracy and human rights are better achieved by soft power which can also create an enabling or disabling environment as the United States discovered in the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq
Skeptics who belittle soft power because it does not solve all problems are like a boxer who fights without using his left hand because his right hand is stronger
Soft power is rarely sufficient but it is often crucial to combine soft and hard power to have an effective mart power strategy
As the American Defense Secretary Robert Gates said last year  am here to make the case for strengthening our capacity to use soft power and for better integrating it with hard power
Military force is obviously a source of hard power but the same resource can sometimes contribute to soft power behavior
The impressive job by the American military in providing humanitarian relief after the Indian Ocean tsunami in  and the South Asian earthquake in  helped restore America attractiveness
On the other hand misuse of military resources can undercut soft power
The Soviet Union had a great deal of soft power in the years after World War II but destroyed it by the way the Kremlin used its hard power against Hungary and Czechoslovakia
Russia is now going through a period of nationalistic reaction to what it regards as the humiliation it suffered after the Soviet empire collapsed
With the rise in energy prices boosting its economy Russia has seen an opportunity to reassert its power over its neighbors
In addition it felt aggrieved by plans for further expansion of NATO a proposed ballistic missile defense system in Eastern Europe and Western recognition of Kosovo secession from Russia ally Serbia
Russia has sought to weaken Georgia government for some time
In early August Russia set a trap in South Ossetia and Georgia foolishly walked into it
If the Russians had used their eacekeeping force solely to protect South Ossetians elfdetermination citing the precedent of Western actions in Kosovo they would have done little damage to their soft power and the benefits could have exceeded the costs
By bombing blockading and occupying many parts of Georgia delaying its withdrawal parading blindfolded Georgian soldiers and failing to protect Georgian citizens Russia lost its claims to legitimacy and sowed fear and mistrust in much of the world
Neighbors such as Ukraine have become more wary
An immediate cost was Poland reversal of its resistance to an American antiballistic missile system
When Russia appealed for support of its Georgia policy to its fellow members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization China and others refused
Longerterm costs may include the failure of Russia proposal for a new European security system a revived European interest in the Nabucco and White Stream gas pipelines that skirt Russia and a decline in foreign investment
In contrast China ended August with its soft power enhanced by its successful Olympic Games
In October  President Hu Jintao declared China intent to increase its soft power and the Olympics were an important part of that strategy
With its establishment of Confucius Institutes to promote Chinese culture increased international broadcasting attraction of foreign students to its universities and softer diplomacy toward its neighbors in Southeast Asia China has made major investments in soft power
Opinion polls show an improvement in its international reputation
But China government did not achieve all its Olympic objectives
By not keeping its promises to allow peaceful demonstrations and free Internet access China undercut its softpower gains
It will take more than a successful Olympics to overcome these selfimposed limits
For example a recent Pew poll showed that despite China efforts to increase its soft power the US remains dominant in all softpower categories
So while China won the most gold medals the Beijing Olympics did not turn the tables on the US outside the sports arenas
One hopes that China leaders will learn the importance of free expression for establishing soft power
Of course only time will tell the ultimate outcomes of the guns and gold of August for Russia and China
Unlike an Olympic competition their recent performance will not be given a final score until well after their power games have been played
The Hague Tribunal Belgradeus View
BELGRADE Opinion polls in Serbia show that large majorities believe the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia to be a political instrument to bash Serbs
So they oppose extradition of the indicted  including expresident Milosevic  to the Hague Tribunal
When the Tribunals chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte comes to Belgrade this Tuesday her welcome will not be warm
Democratic politicians everywhere vie for the support of ethnic lobbies
To gain the Cuban vote in Florida American politicians are tough on Fidel Castro to secure Jewish votes in New York they are soft on Israel
At the same time as they play this game US policymakers both Democrats and Republicans demand that Vojislav Kostunica President of Yugoslavia cooperate with the Hague Tribunal unconditionally
Kostunica however is a sensible politician
He knows that although the Serbian lobby is weak in the US it is allowerful in Serbia
Taking the mood of his voters seriously Kostunica criticizes the Tribunal and expresses reservations about receiving Mrs del Ponte
Long before the civil war in former Yugoslavia I concluded that the world needed an international court to try governments and army commanders for war crimes crimes against humanity and genocide
But ever since the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia was established in  by the UN Security Council I have been disappointed
I feel like some communist true believer who in the s suddenly realized that terror existed in the Soviet Union
Why this change of heart
Biljana Plavsic professor of biology and a leader of Bosnia Serbs recently appeared before the Hague Tribunal to face charges of genocide
But the prosecutor merely repeated accusations about crimes committed by the Bosnian Serbs that have been known for years
Not a shred of new or recent evidence was presented
When Mrs Plavsic was the proestern president of the Serbian part of Bosnia  between  and   and in conflict with her more nationalist colleagues she was hailed in the West as a democrat and champion of tolerance
I remember seeing President Jacques Chirac kiss her hand at the entrance to the Elysee Palace
I am reminded of Stalins purges
One day you are a Hero of the Soviet Union and the next you are shot as an enemy of the people
On May   at the height of the NATO bombing campaign Judge Louise Arbour of Canada Mrs del Ponte predecessor as the Hague Tribunal chief prosecutor issued a warrant for the arrest of President Slobodan Milosevic
The indictment was based on evidence gathered by American and British intelligence services about the expulsions and killings of Albanians in Kosovo
Milosevic could have been charged by the Tribunal years before because of his responsibility for the war in Bosnia
But America State Department needed his support to conclude the Dayton peace agreement of  so Milosevic crimes of the time were conveniently forgotten
Soon after the warrant for Milosevic was issued I heard in Belgrade that Vuk Draskovic an opposition leader was being threatened with indictment by US officials for the activities of his shortived paramilitary organization during the  war in Croatia
It seems as if the Americans were saying stop creating conflicts with other opposition leaders or we will indict you
Is it really so easy to dismiss out of hand as unreconstructed nationalists those Serbs who ask why was Franjo Tudjman the former president of Croatia never indicted
Under his rule almost half a million Serbs were expelled from Croatia he too sent troops into Bosnia to partition Bosnian territory
What of Alija Izetbegovic the Muslim former president of Bosnia who never wanted a multithnic Muslimerbroat Bosnia but rather the first Muslim state in Europe
Under his rule Sarajevo was cleansed of most of its Serbs and Croats
And what of Hashim Thaci the young leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army
When in June  Serbian troops moved out of Kosovo and NATO moved in it was the KLA that really took over
Since then it has destroyed dozens of Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries killed hundreds of civilians and expelled almost all Serbs and other nonlbanians
Last but definitely not least can we avoid asking questions about NATO responsibility
Perhaps several thousand Serbian civilians were killed during the NATO bombing
It may turn that the depleted uranium bullets used during the Kosovo war cause lethal radiation and that some commanders and politicians knew about this
By bombing Serbias infrastructure NATO also violated Article  of the  Protocol of the Geneva Convention of  which prohibits attacks on objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population
America will never accept the jurisdiction of an independent international court over its political leaders and military forces
Nor will any other great power
The spokesman for the International Relations Committee of the US House of Representatives has stated this bluntly Youre more likely to see the UN building dismantled brickyrick and thrown into the Atlantic than see NATO pilots go before a UN tribunal
Instead of being fair and delivering justice the Hague Tribunal has surrendered to political pressures and manipulation
Rather than helping Serbs achieve a moral catharsis by punishing their guilty leaders for their misdeeds the Hague Tribunal is only reinforcing antiestern prejudices and the sense of victimization already pervasive in Serbia
The Haitian Miracle
This spring presidential election in Haiti sadly reenforced the country blighted reputation
The paradox is that today Haiti has a chance perhaps the best in its modern history to escape from its long history of extreme poverty and turmoil
A mere onehour flight from Miami the country struggles with poverty levels akin to the poorest parts of subSaharan Africa
But whereas many parts of the world are extremely poor because of their isolation Haiti is extremely poor despite its proximity to the world largest market
Now Haiti can turn its geography into a competitive advantage but only if the United States helps
Haiti recalls a famous lament once heard about another US neighbor Mexico o far from God and so close to the United States
As with Mexico Haiti proximity to the US has cut both ways in its history
Proximity to the US should of course be an advantage for exports and attracting investment
However proximity has also meant US meddling
Haiti was the second country after the US to win its independence from Europe following a slave rebellion in 
But America regarded Haiti as a threat rather than as a colleague in freedom refusing to extend diplomatic recognition until after the outbreak of the Civil War which finally brought an end to slavery in the US
Even after recognition by President Abraham Lincoln in  relations remained sour
Haiti was exploited and occasionally occupied by US troops rather than being regarded as a legitimate partner in trade and diplomacy
Meanwhile Haiti ecological and demographic conditions posed huge development challenges that have never been overcome
The island is hit regularly by devastating hurricanes
It has been massively deforested and its soils have been depleted of nutrients
Tropical diseases remain killers to this day
A devastating economic blow occurred in the midnineteenth century when Europe learned to produce sugar from a temperatezone crop beets rather than from tropical sugar cane
World sugar prices collapsed and Haiti fell into deeper disarray
Extreme poverty bred illiteracy and miserable governance which in turn intensified hunger disease and instability
Haiti recent economic history is marked by a remarkable and tragic downslide since the mid exacerbated by sometimes wellintentioned but typically disastrously executed US diplomacy
In an attempt to push Haiti toward democracy the US imposed economic sanctions which crippled Haiti fragile and newly emerging export sector especially apparel and other laborintensive production
Unemployment soared
Urban violence spiraled
The US then entered into a destructive year relationship with JeanBertrand Aristide who is massively popular among Haiti poor but distrusted by most of the business sector and many leading US politicians
When Aristide came to power in  the Bush administration cut off most international aid thereby helping to send the economy into a freefall
Aristide government was ousted under highly contested circumstances in 
The newly elected president Rene Preval is a highly talented and experienced agronomist and thus has the perfect background to revive Haiti degraded rural economy
With the US market close by Haiti could achieve a remarkable recovery of exports of horticulture fruits and other agricultural products as well as tourism and light manufactured goods
The key will be for the new government to provide a sound framework which combines key public investments  roads power soil nutrients improved seed varieties public health safe water  with confidencebuilding outreach to the business community and fruitful relations with the US and other donor countries
This time the US has a strong interest in cooperating fully to promote economic progress another round of failure would only provoke chaos including massive numbers of new refugees to the US
The gap between Haiti performance and its potential is now so large that great gains can be achieved in income levels farming health education and more
Crop yields are below one ton of cereal per hectare of farmland  far less than half of what is readily achievable if farmers are helped to gain access to fertilizers improved seeds and basic infrastructure
Similarly health conditions are horrendous but could be improved dramatically just with immunization deworming safe water antibiotics and antimalaria bed nets
Community health workers could be trained in a matter of months to extend basic health care throughout rural areas which could then be better mobilized to fend off the debilitating results of future hurricanes
On the economic front Haiti can become a profitable exporter of tropical crops such as groundnuts mangos cut flowers string beans and bamboo  a source of progress among Haiti Caribbeanbasin neighbors
Preval own hometown has successfully used a modest level of external donor support to create new rural cooperatives to market improved crops
And with its beautiful beaches and remarkable arts and music Haiti could once again become a major tourist destination
Indeed Haiti can become an inspiration for many other fragile and impoverished new democracies
The US France Canada and other major donor countries must not miss this historic opportunity to give vital help to Preval democratically elected new government
The Hamas Earthquake
Hamas crushing defeat of Fatah in this week elections brings the Palestinian people to a crossroads
An Islamist political party that previously abstained from national politics and rejects Fatah policy of negotiations with Israel is now in charge in Palestine
Hamas won  of  seats in the Palestinian Legislative Council and can count on support from four independent deputies
Overall that  of the seats in Parliament won in nearly every district in the West Bank and Gaza
Hamas entered electoral politics only recently but its massive victory was preceded by wide success in municipal elections
Hamas political moment has come
Under Palestinian law Mahmoud Abbas the Palestinian president must now ask Hamas to form a new government
For their part Fatah officials seem unwilling to join a Hamasled government
Although Hamas has said that it would seek such a coalition Fatah humiliating defeat has left it with little credibility as a governing partner
So far Fatah senior leaders have declared that they will be a loyal opposition in Parliament leaving governmental responsibility to Hamas
Instead they will have to focus on rebuilding and reenergizing Fatah
Hamas is well aware of the shock that its victory has produced
If Fatah refuses to join a coalition Hamas may opt for a government of independents and technocrats
It is unlikely that Hamas will form a government composed of hardliners
The political security and economic circumstances of the Palestinians require a government focused on solving problems not ideological purity
The most urgent challenge facing the new government is rampant lawlessness and anarchy throughout Palestinian society
Murder kidnapping and extortion have reached record heights
Armed individuals resort to kidnapping to get jobs free family members from prison and exact revenge
Often the people involved in these crimes belong to local gangs or even to the militias of large clans
In opposition Hamas adamantly refused to collect illegal weapons
Now it will have to deal with a Palestinian society that is armed to the teeth with poverty rates reaching  and unemployment at  
Having benefited from overwhelming political rejection of Fatah Hamas will now be judged by how it uses its new authority
For the first time a political clock is ticking for Hamas
Senior Hamas officials are well aware of the challenge and have promised a complete overhaul of Palestinian public services and administration
More than anything else Hamas success in the coming months will be measured by its response to these issues
Will Hamas be able to root out corruption and incompetence and deliver services fairly and efficiently
How will its election affect Palestine foreign aid inflows which form major component of the national budget
Initial international reaction to the Hamas victory has been severe
The Bush administration has declared that it will not deal with a Hamas government because Hamas remains committed to Israel destruction
This indeed is the language of Hamas  covenant
Interestingly however Hamas election platform combined different approaches to the issue of a Palestinian state
On the one hand Hamas agreed for the first time to the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza with East Jerusalem as its capital
On the other hand the platform repeats Hamas refusal to relinquish even an inch of historic Palestine
Whether Hamas can actually be transformed into a more moderate organization is impossible to say right now
But it is clear that Hamas is now vulnerable to public opinion and as a governing authority will have to deal with the international response to its victory
Immediately after the election a senior Hamas official Mahmoud alZahar said that Hamas would maintain the ceasefire with Israel begun last February if Israel did the same
Hamas may be signaling that it will not provoke Israel
Perhaps its governing responsibilities will push Hamas toward ongoing discussions with the United States and the international community
In any case despite the election results and even without Fatah in government Abbas remains in charge of negotiations with Israel
He has quickly called for a revival of peace talks although Israel like the US has refused to deal with Hamas
Palestinians have entered uncharted waters
They turned out in droves to vote in an election that former US President Jimmy Carter described as honest fair and unmarked by violence
They elected a party which called for eform and change in response to a decade of violence and lawlessness
And Palestinians accepted Hamas view that negotiations based on the Oslo Accords could not achieve Palestinian rights and political ambitions
Victory achieved Hamas will take on the responsibility for the Palestinian side in the IsraeliPalestinian conflict
With the Palestinians future at stake  not to mention the future of Israel and the Middle East  no one can say if Hamas is up to the task
The Hamas Moment
Hamas capture of the Gaza Strip has created along with Iran a second radical Islamist state in the Middle East
The region probably the ArabIsraeli conflict and certainly the Palestinian movement will never be the same
Fatah defeat in Gaza is not due to American foreign policy Israel or anyone but Fatah itself
It is Yasir Arafat ultimate legacy for he encouraged not only terrorist violence against Israel but also anarchy and corruption within his own organization
Most importantly Arafat failed to resolve the conflict or give his people an alternative vision to one of extreme radicalism and endless fighting
By rejecting a compromise peace solution in  that would have created an independent Palestinian state with its capital in east Jerusalem and  billion in international aid Arafat made clear that there would be no alternative moderate scenario for resolving the Palestinians problems
It was clear before the January  elections that Hamas was heading toward a victory
Under weak leadership Fatah did nothing to address its deepseated divisions and corruption
Competing Fatah candidates split the vote ensuring that Hamas nominees won
Even after the defeat Fatah implemented not a single reform or leadership change
Its leaders squabbled regarding themselves as the sole possible rulers and engaging in wishful thinking that some external factor would hand them whatever they wanted
Meanwhile like communist and fascist parties in the past Hamas moved forward with a clear doctrine relative discipline and grim determination
Fatah ideology and practice laid the basis for Hamas to advance
With Fatah demonizing Israel rejecting compromise demanding total victory glorifying terrorist violence and portraying moderation as treason Hamas merely needed to prove that it was better at pursuing this course
No one should underestimate Hamas extremism
Indeed the only difference between Hamas and alQaeda  though the two groups do not generally work together  is that the latter emphasizes attacks on Western targets while the former has until now focused on Israel
Consequently Hamas will not moderate its stance and its victory sets back the chances of IsraelPalestinian peace for decades
Buoyed by its triumph enjoying backing from Syria where its headquarters are located and Iran Hamas will pursue its genocidal and openly stated goal the extinction of Israel and its people
Any thought of concession or compromise is gravely mistaken
Four specific issues now move to centerstage the fate of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip the future of the Fatahruled West Bank the world attitude toward Israel and the strategic impact of Hamas victory on the Middle East
Until now while Gazans have suffered from the constant fighting and economic failures brought about by their leaders policies they have been left alone in their private lives
Hamas might go slower or faster with an slamicizing program
Nevertheless it is determined to transform the lives of those it rules
It will kill as it chooses abolish women rights and indoctrinate schoolchildren with hatred and the ambition to be suicide bombers
Gaza has suffered from anarchy now it will be under the heel of a ruthless dictatorship
For example when Hamas forces seized the Shati refugee camp they deliberately executed three women  two teenagers and a yearold  because they were relatives of Fatah officials
Those truly concerned with the Palestinians wellbeing should direct their criticism at that people leaders and seek to protect their human rights in the Gaza Strip
Fatah rule is still strong in the West Bank but even the Gaza catastrophe is unlikely to lead it to change its ways
Israel willingness to work with Mahmoud Abbas Fatah regime and resumption of fullscale aid by the United States are intended to consolidate a relatively moderate Palestinian government on the West Bank
But whereas Abbas appointed Salam Fayyad a veteran economist who is respected in the West as his new prime minister he probably should have picked someone capable of being tough organizing his forces and fighting back
Logically Fatah should now embrace moderation crack down on crossborder terrorism and seek some kind of peace with Israel
But Fatah has its own view of what is logical  one that might not coincide with such prescriptions
As wildly different as the two cases are Fatah resembles the French monarchy before the revolution incapable of learning from experience or taking the steps needed to avoid its own downfall
The world cannot save Fatah only Fatah can save itself
For Israel of course developments in Gaza pose a great challenge
Israel has long since decided that it has no interest in renewing its control over the Gaza Strip
In some ways Hamas coup makes things clearer
Gaza is ruled by a completely hostile regime
Israel will feel free to retaliate for crossborder attacks and continuing rocket fire at civilian targets within the country
At last the world must recognize that the hopes stirred by the  peace process have been completely dashed
In effect Hamas has returned the conflict to the  and  when progress toward peace had to await the PLO readiness to stop using terrorism and accept Israel existence
Israel survival and right to selfdefense now has to be supported internationally and the slander and demonization of recent years should come to an end
The strategic implications for the region are equally grim
Hamas takeover of Gaza is a victory for the bloc comprising Iran Syria and Hezbollah as well as the separate branches of the Muslim Brotherhood of which Hamas is one seeking to capture power in their own countries
These forces fully comprehend that the most important global contest today is between radical Islamism and the rest of the world
The question is when the rest of the world will figure that out
The Hamas Veto
GAZA CITY  The resumption of direct peace talks between the Palestinians and Israelis has broken  months of stalemate and marked the entry of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu into this round of diplomacy
But these difficult talks face significant challenges from outside the negotiating room particularly from Hamas which is intent on ensuring that nothing happens without its approval
Hamas refuses all direct peace negotiations with Israel and has vowed to derail the current talks through violence
Their first blow came on the eve of the talks when the alQassam Brigades Hamas military wing carried out an ambush on Israeli settlers in Hebron killing four people
Hamas has vowed to continue launching its attacks from inside the West Bank but not from Gaza
This follows from Hamas leaders frequent statements since the  Gaza war that they do not want to provoke another Israeli attack which could cost them their governing position
Israel does not recognize a distinction between Hamasplanned attacks from the West Bank and from Gaza
However a largescale Israeli assault on Hamas Gaza redoubt in response to the West Bank killings could bring the negotiations to a halt
Hamas strategy is to expose the Palestinian Authority weakness by demonstrating that it cannot control the West Bank as it promises in negotiations
Moreover Hamas is well aware that their attacks cause Israel to insist even more strongly on security as the centerpiece of any agreement
This in turn puts the spotlight on ongoing security cooperation between Israel the PA and the United States again undermining the PA claims to represent the Palestinian people
Rhetoric aside Hamas opposition to direct talks with Israel is intended to make clear to the US that Hamas is central to the political reality of the region and cannot be ignored
If Hamas is not part of the process there will be no process
Hamas insists that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas does not have the legitimacy to negotiate on behalf of the Palestinians and that any deal he reaches with Israel is not binding
Hamas claims to be the Palestinians true representative having won the majority of seats in the Palestinian Legislative Council PLC in January  the PLC term expired in January  but fresh elections have yet to be held
As Hamas knows the US holds the key to ending the political isolation imposed on it after its victory in 
Indeed Hamas leaders recently acknowledged sending messages to the Obama administration calling for dialogue
The most recent note sent through a group of visiting American academics asked the US government to take a more balanced position in the IsraeliPalestinian conflict
Hamas for its part has expressed its willingness to accept a Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza subject to a return of all refugees and Israel release of all Palestinian prisoners
But Hamas has not taken what the US considers the critical step of recognizing Israel  and thus accepting a twostate solution
For now Hamas and the Palestinians of Gaza are excluded from the peace talks which means that the negotiations will most likely not lead to an end to the PalestinianIsraeli conflict
But every day that Gazans are left to stew in an unhealthy mix of siege poverty and unemployment is a day that strengthens the Hamas hardliners
The US has invested much in shuttle diplomacy to bring Netanyahu and Abbas to the negotiating table and is not ready to see these talks collapse
But the continuing US boycott of Hamas reinforces the logic of those who are trying to sabotage the negotiations
What do they have to lose
The future of these direct peace talks thus depends not only on Netanyahu and Abbas but also on how they relate to the extremists within their camps
Will Netanyahu abandon his ideological rhetoric negotiate seriously with the Palestinians and make the needed concessions
Can the Palestinians rise to the political moment and take advantage of the pressure coming from US President Barack Obama
The stakes are high and failure would be costly to Americans Israelis and Palestinians
If the talks collapse US foreign policy in the Middle East would be further discredited and nothing would remain to keep the parties from launching another round of conflict
For Palestinians this is likely to be Abbas last chance
He is wagering his scant remaining authority on the talks success and Palestinians will be counting down his days in office should he fail
For Netanyahu perhaps maintaining the status quo will be seen as a victory at least in the short term
But Israel margin for strategic error will shrink even further
Meanwhile Hamas bides its time
A failure of PalestinianIsraeli talks would only prove Hamas basic point nothing moves forward without us
The Hard Right Goes Soft
PARIS  The central paradox of French politics was confirmed once again on March 
In a nationwide vote to select local authorities the so called Conseiller Gnral the farright National Front gained  of the votes cast but secured only  of the seats
This discrepancy between the National Front popular strength and its actual representation has been a permanent feature of French politics since JeanMarie Le Pen established the party  years ago
But Le Pen was replaced in January by his no less charismatic daughter Marine
And with that change the fate of the Front may be changing too
The Front scant number of elected officials reflects the strategy pursued by its two main adversaries the Socialist Party and President Nicolas Sarkozy Union pour un Mouvement Populaire UMP formerly the Gaullist party which have essentially shared all elected posts at the national and local level since the 
In order to preserve their shared domination they have more or less agreed to a epublican Front strategy aimed at excluding the National Front in the second round of all elections
Thus in a direct runoff between a Front candidate and a Socialist or UMP candidate the Socialists and the UMP usually vote for each other
The most striking demonstration of this epublican alliance was the  Presidential election when with Socialist support Jacques Chirac the Gaullist incumbent received  of the popular vote in the runoff against JeanMarie Le Pen
So far this epublican Front strategy of exclusion has succeeded in keeping the far right out of any significant political office for four decades but it has never reduced the size of its electoral base
On the contrary the National Front gains credibility by never having to test its program in government
For last Sunday runoff however Sarkozy broke with convention in races where a Socialist candidate faced off against the National Front his position was o neither
As a result UMP voters split between abstaining supporting the Socialist and voting for the National Front
Compared to Chirac rigid refusal to consider any kind of rapprochement with the Front Sarkozy policy is thus a small step towards recognition of the Front legitimacy
The left has of course denounced this move as risking fascism
But like it or not the Front is a legal party
It may be xenophobic but its leaders never denigrate the Republic there may be fascists members within it but the party plays by the democratic rules
And like it or not the Republican Front may crumble altogether under Marine Le Pen leadership of the party her father founded
Her father was above all an ideologue a opulist Napoleon who would never moderate his vision of a white and Catholic France in need of a moral revival
Thus he rejected the French Revolution and the modern welfare state as much as he opposed Muslim immigration
Gaullists and Socialists are proud that they never compromised with JeanMarie Le Pen but he would not have negotiated with them anyway
Le Pen ambition was always to ave France not to become Minister of Tourism
His daughter however has clearly softened the tone
Since Marine Le Pen took the helm she has proven herself able to combine the National Front trademark antiimmigration stance the hard core of its ideology with praise for the state and the Republic
And she has brought a fresh anticapitalist tone to the Front rhetoric  always a crowd pleaser in France
Marine Le Pen is seeking the same path to power traveled by Italy Northern League the Flemish Interest Party Liveable Netherlands and the Danish People Party all of which first became oft populist parties
As a result of this shift in the near future Sarkozy conservatives may have no choice but to ally with the Front
Sarkozy attempt to coopt farright rhetoric on security and immigration has not worked because when it comes to national chauvinism the French prefer its authentic purveyors
And the French  and voters elsewhere in Europe  vote for farright parties the most when the far left is weakest
Indeed the National Front is strongest precisely where the Communist Party once was the leading force
Between onequarter and onethird of Continental Europeans feel permanently disenfranchised and are prepared to vote for any rotest party whether far right or far left
The reason is essentially the same throughout Europe slow economic growth implies few prospects for a better life while the welfare state has failed to create jobs
The far left indicts capitalism the far right points the finger of blame at immigrants
The far left would recommend revolution the far right ethnic cleansing
Anticapitalist revolution was tried in half of Europe in the last century with dire results
Expulsion of immigrants has not
Given a slow economy a failed welfare state and uncontrolled immigration  challenges for which no mainstream parties on the right or the left have any coherent proposals  the appeal of the far right soft populism will continue to haunt France and Europe
The Harmony Trap
A widespread feeling exists that European integration is proceeding sideways if not backwards
But in at least one field real progress has been made the Commissions endeavor to build a single market for financial services
An ambitious Financial Services Action Plan  launched in  to bring about a single European wholesale market open and secure retail markets and stateoftheart prudential rules and supervision  envisaged  measures to be implemented by 
After a slow start rapid progress has been achieved with  measures formally adopted including important directives on market abuse prospectuses financial collateral distance marketing collective investment schemes and a common set of International Accounting Standards for the consolidated accounts of all listed companies
A common position has been reached on four more measures including directives on investment services on transparency and on takeovers
There has also been an institutional leap forward with the adoption of the socalled Lamfalussy method for quick adoption of implementing measures and approval of a European regulators committee
Impressive results
But to assess their relevance three questions must be asked was such harmonization necessary
How satisfactory are its results over and above the sheer number of measures adopted
Most importantly is completion of the FSAP sufficient to achieve the single financial market
The first question reflects a longstanding and apparently philosophical dispute between Britain  more accurately the socalled British financial industry which comprises almost exclusively nonBritish firms  and the Continent
A onesizefitsall approach the British argue is incompatible with existing differences between EU states all that is needed is mutual recognition leaving the rest to competition and investors choices
Insufficient harmonization however has often allowed member states to erect barriers to competition which can only be removed by consistent implementation of laws and standards
This is why securities law unlike company law has federal status in the US
A more level playing field achieved by a 
 gradual
 increase in the level of harmonization that is driven by both institutions and markets will in the end provide a better opportunity for the fittest to survive
As for what has already been achieved some measures deserve unqualified praise
Adoption of a common set of advanced accounting principles will remove a key obstacle to meaningful comparison of European listed companies profitability although more needs to be done to achieve common standards of enforcement as recent corporate scandals show
The directive on market abuse provides European regulators with greater investigative and sanctioning power as well as enhancing cooperation
The prospectus directive allows companies to issue shares and raise capital in all European markets by using the same prospectus as approved by each companys national authority
The most delicate issues are those raised by the Investment Services Directive on which only a majority of member states have reached a common position
The directive firmly and rightly frees competition among all trading venues removing the privileges enjoyed by official exchanges
Trades must no longer be concentrated on an officially regulated market which means that assessment of best execution remains an open question especially when trades are internalized by intermediaries acting as counterparts to their customers
No obvious solution to this problem exists in a multivenue world where best execution can neither be presumed nor categorically defined
But the fullest possible information in executing trades is a necessary condition hence the imposition of pretrade posting orders and prices and posttrade transparency for intermediaries trading on their own account with retail investors  a requirement that has been firmly opposed by all the states where the relevant internalizers reside
This resistance should not be allowed to prevent the European Parliament from endorsing the common position markets and regulators alike urgently need a new ISD as innovations have made the old one obsolete
Thus while certain 
 necessary
 requirements for the existence of a single European financial market have been established they are far from 
 sufficient
  at least at the retail level
This is not so much because further topdown measures are needed but because market failures hamper the required bottomup drive
Markets are created and developed by market participants not by rules and regulation says the City of London
True perhaps but the record is far from brilliant
The persistent fragmentation of privately owned European exchanges is not due primarily to regulatory obstacles
More relevantly the high cost of crossborder transactions reflects inefficiencies in the posttrade stage especially clearing and settlement
As stated in the socalled Giovannini Report to the European Commission The posttrade landscape could be significantly improved by marketled convergence across national systems
But a major obstacle to this is the existence of local rentseeking franchises and monopolies
Silent progress is instead being made on another front
As a result of the Lamfalussy report not only was the legislative process improved but an important institutional status was conferred upon the Committee of European Securities Regulators
Apart from its consultative role in drafting legislation the CESR has now been mandated to set guidelines and common standards for national regulation and enhancing cooperation
This is potentially the most important step towards establishing a level playing field as the transposition of Community legislation into national regulation still leaves too much room for discretion
The plea for a single European regulator a European SEC is at the moment misguided there is no legal basis in the Treaty or in the draft constitution member states legal systems are too different rules are not sufficiently harmonized and Community law appears to be moving towards decentralization
A gradual approach based on growing coordination of national regulations and regulatory practices at the CESR level appears to be the most viable alternative
The Harsh Lessons of 
NEW YORK  The best that can be said for  is that it could have been worse that we pulled back from the precipice on which we seemed to be perched in late  and that  will almost surely be better for most countries around the world
The world has also learned some valuable lessons though at great cost to both current and future prosperity  costs that were unnecessarily high given that we should already have learned them
The first lesson is that markets are not selfcorrecting
Indeed without adequate regulation they are prone to excess
In  we again see why Adam Smith invisible hand often appears invisible it is not there
The bankers pursuit of selfinterest greed did not lead to the wellbeing of society it did not even serve their shareholders and bondholders well
It certainly did not serve homeowners who are losing their homes workers who have lost their jobs retirees who have seen their retirement funds vanish or taxpayers who paid hundreds of billions to bail out the banks
Under the threat of a collapse of the entire system the safety net intended to help unfortunate individuals meet the exigencies of life  was generously extended to commercial banks then to investment banks insurance firms auto companies even carloan companies
Never has so much money been transferred from so many to so few
We are accustomed to thinking of government transferring money from the well off to the poor
Here it was the poor and average transferring money to the rich
Already heavily burdened taxpayers saw their money  intended to help banks lend so that the economy could be revived  go to pay outsized bonuses and dividends
Dividends are supposed to be a share of profits here it was simply a share of government largesse
The justification was that bailing out the banks however messily would enable a resumption of lending
That has not happened
All that happened was that average taxpayers gave money to the very institutions that had been gouging them for years  through predatory lending usurious creditcard interest rates and nontransparent fees
The bailout exposed deep hypocrisy all around
Those who had preached fiscal restraint when it came to small welfare programs for the poor now clamored for the world largest welfare program
Those who had argued for the free market virtue of ransparency ended up creating financial systems so opaque that banks could not make sense of their own balance sheets
And then the government too was induced to engage in decreasingly transparent forms of bailout to cover up its largesse to the banks
Those who had argued for ccountability and esponsibility now sought debt forgiveness for the financial sector
The second important lesson involves understanding why markets often do not work the way they are meant to work
There are many reasons for market failures
In this case toobigtofail financial institutions had perverse incentives if they gambled and succeeded they walked off with the profits if they lost the taxpayer would pay
Moreover when information is imperfect markets often do not work well  and information imperfections are central in finance
Externalities are pervasive the failure of one bank imposed costs on others and failures in the financial system imposed costs on taxpayers and workers all over the world
The third lesson is that Keynesian policies do work
Those countries like Australia that implemented large well designed stimulus programs early emerged from the crisis faster
Other countries succumbed to the old orthodoxy pushed by the financial wizards who got us into this mess
Whenever an economy goes into recession deficits appear as tax revenues fall faster than expenditures
The old orthodoxy held that one had to cut the deficit  raise taxes or cut expenditures  to estore confidence
But those policies almost always reduced aggregate demand pushed the economy into a deeper slump and further undermined confidence ost recently when the International Monetary Fund insisted on them in East Asia in the 
The fourth lesson is that there is more to monetary policy than just fighting inflation
Excessive focus on inflation meant that some central banks ignored what was happening to their financial markets
The costs of mild inflation are miniscule compared to the costs imposed on economies when central banks allow asset bubbles to grow unchecked
The fifth lesson is that not all innovation leads to a more efficient and productive economy  let alone a better society
Private incentives matter and if they are not well aligned with social returns the result can be excessive risk taking excessively shortsighted behavior and distorted innovation
For example while the benefits of many of the financialengineering innovations of recent years are hard to prove let alone quantify the costs associated with them  both economic and social  are apparent and enormous
Indeed financial engineering did not create products that would help ordinary citizens manage the simple risk of home ownership  with the consequence that millions have lost their homes and millions more are likely to do so
Instead innovation was directed at perfecting the exploitation of those who are less educated and at circumventing the regulations and accounting standards that were designed to make markets more efficient and stable
As a result financial markets which are supposed to manage risk and allocate capital efficiently created risk and misallocated wildly
We will soon find out whether we have learned the lessons of this crisis any better than we should have learned the same lessons from previous crises
Regrettably unless the United States and other advanced industrial countries make much greater progress on financialsector reforms in  we may find ourselves faced with another opportunity to learn them
The Hazard of Second Best
NEWPORT BEACH  The international community risks settling for second best on two key issues to be discussed this month at global meetings in Washington DC the lingering if currently somewhat dormant European debt crisis and the selection of the World Bank next president
It is not too late to change course but doing so will require the United States and governments in Europe to resist harmful habits and emerging countries to follow up effectively on recent initiatives
In the last few days European leaders including French President Nicolas Sarkozy and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi have declared that the worst of the eurozone crisis is over
Others like French Finance Minister Francois Baroin have gone even further claiming that Europe as done its part and that it is now up to other countries to do theirs
These announcements should come as no surprise
Having experienced prolonged turmoil the eurozone is currently in a period of relative tranquility
The courageous reform measures implemented by Mario Monti Italy technocratic prime minister have eased immediate concerns that Greek dislocations might tip other European countries  much bigger and harder to rescue  into insolvency
Europe decision last week to bolster its internal financial firewalls has reinforced the resulting positive impact on market sentiment
But as important as these steps are the recent tranquility has been more borrowed than earned
Since December the ECB has twice deployed longterm refinancing operations which provide unlimited threeyear financing to banks at  interest
This has given the banking system more time to increase capital and improve asset quality
It has also reduced several governments financing costs
What it does not do and is not meant to do is resolve Europe twin problems of too little growth and too much debt
If it is not careful Europe risks falling into the trap of trying to shift responsibility for its problems onto others rather than building on recent progress
That temptation is partly reflected in efforts to press officials from around the world to agree this month to a major increase in the International Monetary Fund resources with emerging economies footing a significant part of the bill
In pivoting from internal to externallyfinanced firewalls Europe is pushing a political agenda that is not yet warranted by economic and financial realities
Europeans are about to embark on another round of elections in both core and peripheral EU countries as well as a referendum in Ireland
Recent history suggests that these votes are unlikely to favor ruling parties unless they can signal some progress in resolving the crisis
The rest of the world should counter the risk of European complacency and the US should take the lead
But US officials no longer seem interested because they need to secure Europe support for another second best this month the anointment of the American candidate Jim Yong Kim as the World Bank new president
For the first time in its nearly year history the Bank executive board is also considering two nonAmericans for the job the Colombian Jose Antonio Ocampo and the Nigerian Ngozi OkonjoIweala
The nomination of these two unambiguously qualified and experienced individuals to compete with Kim is an important first step in changing the feudalistic practice whereby nationality has been the overriding criterion for selecting the World Bank president as well as the choice of the IMF managing director which Europe controls
All three candidates meet US President Barack Obama justified insistence that  development professionalead the world largest development agency
But this does not make them equal
They are not
A consensus has emerged that when judged by the Bank own criteria for the job the highly respected OkonjoIweala dominates the other two candidates
On that basis she has already gained the endorsement of influential observers and opinionforming media outlets
Moreover her appointment would speak to other important initiatives with which Obama has aligned himself including efforts to fight corruption strengthen meritocracy and support gender equality
I suspect that in their hearts US officials know that Kim while an inspired nominee is not the best candidate
Yet their historical attachment to a harmful nationalitybased entitlement stops them from opting for the best
Meanwhile Europeans are happy to hold their tongue as a reward to the US for having supported their nationalitybased appointment last year of Christine Lagarde to head the IMF
The responsibility of resisting two second bests now falls to emerging countries
It is up to them to do the right thing this month
And for the first time in my career observing the international monetary system they are in a position to take three important steps
First since they are expected to contribute significant financial resources emerging economies can postpone bolstering the IMF until the eurozone does more to improve the policy mix in member countries and further strengthens its financial firewalls and fiscal harmonization
Second by asking Ocampo to step aside in favor of OkonjoIweala they can unite their votes behind a highly credible meritbased appointment for the World Bank
Finally they can put pressure on their Western counterparts by maintaining momentum on the alternative of a evelopment bank for the South an initiative that received support at last week BRICs meeting in India
The considerations of Realpolitik that influence global meetings often lead to secondbest compromises as a means of avoiding more costly inaction
By contrast this month discussions in Washington can and should opt for the first best
But this will happen only if emerging countries play their cards well and if Europe and the US do what is in their own best longerterm interests as well as those of the global economy
The Healing of Taiwan
BANGKOK  Last week a Taiwanese court sentenced Chen Shuibien Taiwan president from  until  to life imprisonment for corruption
Chen had been caught stealing millions of dollars of public funds
He did not act alone
His wife who also received a life sentence children and other relatives all helped to hide the stolen loot in overseas accounts
Taiwan former first family turned out to be a den of common thieves
Chen and his ruling Democratic Progressive Party camouflaged their personal and parochial financial interests behind the patriotic mask of ensuring the survival of a democratic Chinese society in an independent Taiwan  For years Chen was perceived as a brave David fighting the communist Goliath and attracted many admirers around the world including me at one point
Presenting himself and his Party as champions of democracy Chen sought to create the impression among Taiwan voters that their freedom would perish in the hands of the Kuomintang KMT or any party other than his own
But in fact it was the late President Chiang Chingkuo the son of Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek who instituted the unprecedented democratic reforms that paved the way for the eventual electoral triumph of Chen formerly banned DPP
Chen personal wealth grew conspicuously shortly after he assumed office but no one could produce hard evidence of his corruption back then
His political supporters initially brushed aside the mushrooming rumors of his selfenrichment as opposition KMT propaganda
But one by one most of the DPP founding fathers all left the party accusing Chen of corruption and autocratic behavior even within his own party  which Chen dismissed as sour grapes from people who wanted their share of the political spoils
In fact Chen was always more concerned with consolidating his own power than with defending Taiwan
His most controversial political moves were aimed at his domestic opponents not the Chinese government on the mainland
He led a vicious campaign to portray all Taiwanese with mainland Chinese roots even if born and bred in Taiwan as untrustworthy carpetbaggers  wai shen ren  or ot native people  as if they were aliens from a different culture
This official effort to portray native aiwanese as a separate ethnic group with scant relation to Chinese culture was extended to language as Chen favored using the Fujian dialect in lieu of the Mandarin spoken by  billion Chinese and taught all over the world
Meanwhile the Ministry of Education sought to expunge all references to China in school textbooks
So insistent was Chen campaign that it reminded some people of Mao Cultural Revolution a time when Chinese were divided into s and hem
Indeed under Chen policy Taiwan nearly became a rigidly divided society where ocal and ot native Chinese lived as potential enemies
Taiwan  sole aboriginal parliamentarian once provided the logical rebuttal to Chen and the DPP delivering a speech to a packed Congress entirely in his native tongue which nobody else in the chamber could understand
The message was obvious his was the only group with a legitimate claim to being native Taiwanese
In the end Chen effort was as futile as it was foolish
The Chinese culture embodied in the daily lives of  million Taiwanese of whatever political beliefs was not so easily eliminated by decree
Moreover the attempt to do so angered the overwhelming majority of Taiwanese who finally understood the stupidity of Chen policy particularly how it led to economic stagnation at a time when mainland China was booming
Indeed Taiwanese capital and knowhow built much of China hitech industries and well over a halfmillion Taiwanese live and work near Shanghai in a virtual replica of Hsin Chu Taiwan Silicon Valley
But in Chen Taiwan domestic squabbles took precedence over economic development
Chen invariably blamed the KMT for blocking sensible economic plans but even some of his moneyed supporters knew better
When it was finally proved that power had turned Chen into a common criminal the KMT was voted back into power
But while Chen legacy of lies and corruption has ended the reborn KMT under President Ma Yingjeou has much to do to convince a cynical public that Chen ways reminiscent of KMT own darker past have not become embedded in the system
Chen jail sentence should also serve to remind the DPP that it must become a party for all Taiwanese ocal or not if it is to have any chance at a revival
Taiwan people know that they cannot prosper as a democracy if ethnic divisiveness is allowed to hold sway
The Health Challenge in EmergingMarket Cities
OXFORD  Emerging markets  Brazil China India Indonesia Mexico Russia Turkey and some  other countries in Africa Asia Europe and Latin America  account for a rapidly growing share of the world population and economy
But their governments now face one of the major challenges of the twentyfirst century creating publichealth solutions that match the speed and scale of urbanization
The four largest emerging markets account for more than  of the world population and have a collective GDP of nearly  trillion
It is expected that their economies will overtake those of the G by  and that by  Brazil China India Mexico and Russia will with the US be the worlds dominant economies
Today however these countries cities must contend with economic and social issues that are more acute more urgent and of a vastly larger scale than those that confronted European and American cities in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
A principal challenge is managing the consequences of the explosive growth of urban populations
More than half of the world population now lives in cities
In my own country Pakistan Karachi is growing at a rate of  people per day
Massive migration to urban areas high unemployment low incomes poor housing and sanitation inadequate infrastructure and social deprivation are shared symptoms of economic hubs where population growth has not been reconciled with cohesive approaches to publichealth policy
As government business and academic leaders agreed at a recent meeting held under the auspices of the Emerging Markets Symposium the promise of emergingmarket countries will not be realized if their cities and consequently their economies are sick
A seminal  report on human development by my compatriot Mahbub ul Haq stressed the differences between human security viewed as personal security and viewed as national security
He used humandevelopment indicators rather than aggregate national indicators to measure economic and social progress
His fundamental proposition was that development is about people
Nothing is more fundamental to human security than health which permits human choice enables human freedom and underpins human development
We often focus on health care and emphasize the roles of medicine and physicians
But health is also about wellness the security of life and the capacity to work and learn
As the economist and philosopher Amartya Sen has put it ealth is a precondition for functional effectiveness across a whole range of human activities
Even as the disease burden in emergingmarket cities shifts from infectious to chronic illnesses urban populations remain vulnerable to epidemic disease childhood diseases born of malnutrition HIVAIDS malaria tuberculosis and mental disorders rooted in unemployment and poverty
They are also vulnerable to death and injury from natural disasters and traffic accidents  and to the health consequences of social disorder and breakdown
The speed of urban growth and the resulting concentration of poverty have overwhelmed the capacity of some national and municipal governments to provide services  sustainable and affordable housing clean water and sanitation and education  essential to urban public health
But the concentration of people and economic activity in emergingmarket cities and megacities does offer invaluable opportunities of scale for building healthrelated infrastructure and delivering healthcare services
Several steps should be taken
Emergingmarket governments must address critical issues arising from weak coordination within and between national and municipal governments on health and healthcare policies and programs
They should consider reforms that include giving city governments the authority resources and responsibility that they need to address health and healthcare outcomes
Anticipatory city planning based on realistic demographic forecasts patient registers and healthinformation systems as well as participation in urban healthknowledge networks needs to be implemented
Proven systems and reforms should be shared between emergingmarket cities and successful new innovations and ideas should be adapted to local conditions
This includes new and affordable technologies such as lowcost mobile telephony for use by communityhealth workers
In Pakistan for example there are  million mobile phone subscribers in a population of  million
Mobile telephones can help deliver affordable urban health care by serving as diagnostic tools for taking pictures and by their usefulness for writing prescriptions and monitoring the condition of patients in lowincome areas
In short urban public health needs to be reinvented
The health of emergingmarket cities  and countries  demands no less
The Health of American Politics
CAMBRIDGE  When the United States Congress approved President Barack Obama plan to extend healthcare coverage to nearly all Americans it marked the most important social legislation the country had seen since the 
While Republican opposition remains strong the law was a major domestic political victory for Obama
Its enactment also has broader implications because like Obama election in  it addresses questions about the health of America political system
After all it was once widely asserted that an AfricanAmerican without a political machine could not become president
Recently many observers argued that America gridlocked political system would prevent the country from translating its abundant power resources into leadership
As one perceptive journalist recently argued merica still has the means to address nearly any of its structural weaknesses energy use medical costs the right educational and occupational mix to rebuild a robust middle class
That is the American tragedy of the early st century a vital and selfrenewing culture that attracts the world talent and a governing system that increasingly looks like a joke
Power conversion  translating power resources into effective influence  is a longstanding problem for the US
The Constitution is based on an eighteenthcentury liberal view that power is best controlled by fragmentation and countervailing checks and balances
In foreign policy the US Constitution has always invited the president and Congress to struggle for control
Strong economic and ethnic pressure groups fight for their selfinterested definitions of the national interest
Congress always pays attention to squeaky wheels and special interests press it to legislate foreignpolicy tactics codes of conduct and sanctions for other countries
As Henry Kissinger once noted hat is presented by foreign critics as America quest for domination is very frequently a response to domestic pressure groups
The cumulative effect Kissinger continued rives American foreign policy toward unilateral and bullying conduct
For unlike diplomatic communications which are generally an invitation to dialogue legislation translates into a takeitorleaveit prescription the operational equivalent of an ultimatum
There is also a concern about the decline of public confidence in US institutions
In  only onefifth of Americans said that they trusted the government to do what is right all or most of the time
As former Clinton administration official William Galston put it rust is never more important than when citizens are asked to make sacrifices for a brighter future
Mistrust of the government making this request could be the harbinger  even the cause  of national decline
The US was founded in part on mistrust of government and a long tradition traceable to Thomas Jefferson holds that Americans should not worry too much about low levels of confidence in government
When asked not about daytoday governance but about the underlying constitutional framework the public is positive
Indeed if you ask Americans where the best place to live is  say the US
If asked whether they like their democratic system of government  say yes
Few people believe that the system is rotten and must be overthrown
Some aspects of the current mood are probably cyclical while others represent discontent with political bickering and deadlock
True when compared to the recent past party politics has become more polarized
But nasty politics is nothing new and much of the evidence for loss of trust in government comes from polling data which weighs responses that are sensitive to the way questions are asked
Moreover the sharpest decline occurred more than four decades ago in the late  and early 
This does not imply that expressions of declining confidence in government are not problematic
Whatever the reasons for the decline if the public becomes unwilling to provide such crucial resources as tax dollars or to comply voluntarily with laws or if bright young people refuse to go into government service governmental capacity will be impaired and people will become more dissatisfied with it
A climate of distrust can also trigger extreme actions by deviant members of the population such as the bombing of a federal office building in Oklahoma City in 
So far such behavioral results do not seem to have materialized
The Internal Revenue Service sees no increase in tax cheating
By many accounts government officials have become less corrupt than in earlier decades and the World Bank gives the US a high score above the th percentile on ontrol of corruption
Moreover after a year drop in voting rates in presidential elections from  to  the decline stopped in  and returned to  in 
Citizens behavior does not seem to have changed as dramatically as have their responses to poll questions
Threequarters of Americans feel connected to their communities and say the quality of life there is excellent or good  say working with others in their community is the most important thing that they can do
In recent years American politics and political institutions have become more polarized than the distribution of opinions in the American public would suggest
The situation was exacerbated by the economic downturn after 
As an editorial in The Economist recently concluded merica political system was designed to make legislation at the federal level difficult not easy
Its founders believed that a country the size of America is best governed locally not nationallySo the basic system works but that is no excuse for ignoring areas where it could be reformed such as the gerrymandered safe seats in the House of Representatives and the blocking procedures of Senate rules and filibusters
Whether the American political system can reform itself and cope with such problems remains to be seen
Obama healthcare victory like his  election suggests that America political system is not as broken as critics who draw analogies to the fall of Rome or other empires would have us believe
The Healthier Poor
Life expectancy in the world highincome countries is now  years while it is only  years in the leastdeveloped countries and as low as  years in some AIDSridden African countries
For every  children born in rich countries seven die before their fifth birthday for every  births in the poorest countries  children die before their fifth birthday
These deaths are not only human tragedies but also calamities for economic development systematically reducing economic growth and helping to keep the poorest countries trapped in poverty
But a growing number of programs around the world are proving that the death and illness of the poor can be reduced sharply and rapidly with targeted investments in public health programs
Big victories in recent years have come through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria
The Fund established six years ago has provided financing to more than  countries to scale up their programs against these three killer diseases
Since then Global Fund programs have helped roughly one million Africans to receive antiretroviral medicines to treat AIDS financed the distribution of around  million bed nets to combat malaria and supported treatment of around two million people with TB
Malaria can be brought under decisive control through bed nets indoor spraying of insecticides and making medicines freely available to poor people in malariaprone villages
In just two days last year Kenya government distributed more than two million bed nets
Similar mass distribution programs have been implemented in Ethiopia Rwanda Togo Niger Ghana and other places
The results are amazing
The poor use the bed nets effectively and the burden of malaria comes down rapidly
Likewise a campaign led by Rotary International and several partners has nearly eradicated polio
The number of cases worldwide each year is now in the hundreds compared to many tens of thousands when the campaign began
Success is being achieved in even the most remote and difficult places such as the povertystricken states of northern India
Indeed India is doing much more with its remarkable National Rural Health Mission NRHM which is the single largest mobilization of public health measures in the world
An astounding halfmillion young woman have recently been hired as health workers to link impoverished households and public clinics and hospitals which are being improved and to increase women access to emergency obstetrical care in order to avoid tragic and unnecessary deaths in childbirth
Another remarkable success in India is the safe homecare of newborn infants in the first few days of life
Currently an alarming number of newborns die because of infection mothers failure to breastfeed during the first days or other preventable causes
By training community health workers the NRHM has achieved a marked reduction in newborn deaths in Indian villages
All these programs refute three widely held myths
The first is that the burden of disease among the poor is somehow inevitable and unavoidable as if the poor are bound to get sick and die prematurely
In fact the poor die of known and identifiable causes that are largely preventable and treatable at very low cost
There is no excuse for millions of deaths from malaria AIDS TB polio measles diarrhea or respiratory infections or for so many women and infants to die in or after childbirth
The second myth is that aid from rich countries is inevitably wasted
This fallacy is repeated so often by ignorant leaders in rich countries that it has become a major barrier to progress
The rich like to blame the poor partly because it lets them off the hook and partly because it gives them a feeling of moral superiority
But poor countries are capable of establishing effective public health programs rapidly when they are helped
Recent success stories have been made possible through a combination of increased spending from poor countries budgets supplemented by aid from richcountry donors
The third myth is that saving the poor will worsen the population explosion
But households in the leastdeveloped countries have many children  an average of five per woman  partly because fear of high childhood death rates leads them to overcompensate with large families
When childhood death rates come down fertility rates tend to decline even more since families are now confident that their children will survive
The result is slower population growth
It is time to make good on a basic global commitment  that everybody poor and rich alike  should have access to basic health services
If just  of richworld income were devoted to lifesaving health care for the poor it would be possible to raise life expectancy decrease child mortality save mothers in childbirth slow population growth and spur economic development throughout the poor world
The success stories in public health for the poor are multiplying
Given the low cost and the huge benefits of supporting such efforts there is no excuse for inaction
The Heart of Reconstruction
CAPETOWN  As the eighteenthcentury theological philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg reminds us the written word is humankind exclusive property
So there is a commonly accepted recognition that the responsibility writers possess for this treasure is great
Yet there are as many disagreements about the role that literature is to play in society as there are definitions of that role
Some see writing as purely the aesthetic exploration of language of the word
Indeed some modern authors as Susan Sontag once remarked can be ecognized by their efforts to disestablish themselves that is by their ill not to be morally useful to the community
Such writers do not seek the role of social critic but rather envision themselves as acting as eers spiritual adventurers and social pariahs
The German novelist Thomas Mann was deeply opposed to such deliberate isolation on the part of writers posing instead the claims that society makes upon art he courage to recognize and express  that is the quality that makes literature
And a similar argument can be heard from the Polish poet Czeslaw Milosz hat is poetry which does not save nations or peoples
A connivance with official lies
In the recent history of our country we South African writers have been faced directly in our poetry prose and plays with the daunting challenge of which Milosz spoke
Transformation of the world of apartheid by literary means and or style was simply not a possibility in a world of racial classification mass relocation and removal of peoples the silencing of our people by detention without trial the banishment of our people to our own Devil Island and the overwhelming and everpresent racist rhetoric of Verwoerd Botha and Terreblanche
If literature was to meet the challenge posed by apartheid at all it had to act in light of what the critic Walter Benjamin most admired in the playwright Bertolt Brecht The aim and responsibility of the writer must be to cause his or her audience to be astonished at the circumstances under which he or she is functioning
From that unambiguous premise came what is known as our protest literature
And if the aesthetic exploration of the word was no longer the goal it could not be abandoned entirely and with disdain whatever we wrote and now write with whatever purpose whether to express the struggle for freedom or the passion of a love affair can approach the power of truth only to the extent that we are capable of exploring the splendor of language brought into its service
In South Africa we had to clear our language of apartheid claptrap and the official euphemisms that sought to shroud the horrors of our daily lives  euphemisms such as resettlement for anishment and ermanent removal for eathsquad assassination
Yes we had to clear our heads of the official language before we could write in a creative one and some of us had to pay dearly for writings that asserted the truth in the face of connivance with the official lies Our books were banned from publication and removed from circulation and we experienced  either formally or through pressure on our family friends and associates  personal bans that kept us from the outside world and the outside world from us
Worst of all some of us were condemned to bans that silenced us bans that prevented us from writing at all
Today we South African writers are hungry for an exchange of ideas with writers and artists from whom we were forcibly quarantined for so long
This creative isolation was something that we accepted as part of our contribution to the global political economic and cultural isolation of the apartheid regime an essential strategy in the struggle for liberation
Now we are free to enjoy and profit from our growing contacts with literary comrades a word that may have poisonous associations in the former communist countries but that continues to be used here for its connotation of genuine human solidarity from our own continent and with whomever will invite us to their countries or even better come to ours
On our home ground black and white South Africans are now legally brothers and sisters united formally and politically in one country
But how can this formal status be made into a social and spiritual reality
Art and literature were at the heart of the revolution and they must remain engaged today for they lie at the heart of reconciliation and reconstruction as well
The Heart of The Matter
KIEV Recently I visited two cities  Chernobyl and Yalta  that have moved beyond notations on a map to become symbols of our century
Chernobyl is a ghost town  a contaminated deserted place where time stands still
Its name is a warning informing humanity that the great inventions produced by rational minds also expose us to unprecedented dangers
For when we touch the heart of matter we also touch the hidden order of Being beyond scientific understanding
We must honour this order if we do not want to fall prey to the arrogant belief that discovering fragments of truth may enable us to master the universe
Until recently people in the Europe savagely controlled by totalitarian regimes also lived in a tainted and oppressed environment
A warning against the arrogance of rationality is at the same time a warning against the arrogance of social engineers  those who believe that a freer and happier life for mankind can be secured solely by devising scientific plans for it from above
We who experienced communism know well the outcomes of such beliefs dead artificial cities gigantic waterworks that fail only after destroying diverse ecosystems vast largely anonymous and thus irresponsible states deciding where and how we shall dwell work relax or amuse ourselves
Such beliefs engineer a dull and gray life devoid of anything unique because individuality is deemed irrational nonsystemic unnecessary
Chemobyl holds out another message a radioactivity that ignores national boundaries reminds us that we live  for the first time in history  in one interconnected civilization wrapping the planet
Whatever happens in one place can for better or worse affect us all
The word Yalta too has assumed a life of its own serving for years as a symbol of a division of the world by the great powers of the large and powerful deciding the fate of the small and powerless without asking their advice of inadmissibly pragmatic concessions or compromises by democratic governments visvis the overpowering strength of a totalitarian regime
For decades our world existed under a shell of bipolarity with two power blocs opposing each other on values ideas and political convictions
Both systems held relatively firmly together though the glue that bound them was different and both attempted to strengthen their positions throughout the world
Under that shell however there was change
The world today is completely different from what it was when the Iron Curtain was hung
With the tottering tower of communist totalitarianism collapsed the Iron Curtains fall revealed the actual contours of the world as well as the depth of its challenge
Difficult as it was for the forces of freedom and democracy to prevail over totalitarianism it will be even more difficult to win the peace to develop and enforce optimal patterns for a new life together of states and nations on this planet that addresses the worlds present condition
One of the many principles that I believe should govern this great undertaking is to develop in the international community the maximum degree of respect for the democratically and freely expressed will of individual nations or states
Each should have the unreserved right to decide their futures their international associations and where they belong or want to belong
The more the international community respects this will  provided that this does not interfere with the legitimate will of other nations  the more stable the world will be
The last few decades as well as previous history offer ample evidence that an imposed order will inevitably collapse
The collapse of an artificial order often takes a toll indeed may be as exacting as the price first paid for the imposition of that order
In other words there should be no more symbolic Yaltas
Never again should others decide the future of peoples and countries at the very least nobody should undertake such decisionmaking without knowing and respecting the legitimate and freely expressed ambitions of the nations concerned
No state must be denied the right to freely decide to which regional groupings  political security economic  it wants to belong
Decisions about admission should not be determined by the geopolitical interests of others but solely by the measure of a state readiness tested by objective criteria to adopt the standards of these groupings and respect their underlying principles
As we confront the warnings of Chemobyl and Yalta it is time to seek that which transcends the horizon of mere rational or scientific thought and the limits of the illusory pretensions of Chernobyls social engineers and Yaltas geopolitical strategists
As individuals and as a community we must delve into our history our souls and all our experience to try to dig out our vanishing respect for the universes mysterious order for the unique human being for cultural and community identities  and restore humble acceptance of the fact that we are all but component parts of the universe and not its masters
The Heart of the US Election
CHICAGO  A real debate is emerging in America presidential election campaign
It is superficially about health care and taxes
More fundamentally it is about democracy and free enterprise
Democracy and free enterprise appear to be mutually reinforcing  it is hard to think of any flourishing democracy that is not a market economy
Moreover while a number of nominally socialist economies have embraced free enterprise or ocialism with Chinese characteristics as the Chinese Communist Party would say it seems to be only a matter of time before they are forced to become more democratic
Yet it is not clear a priori why democracy and free enterprise should be mutually supportive
After all democracy implies regarding individuals as equal and treating them as such with every adult getting an equal vote whereas free enterprise empowers individuals based on how much economic value they create and how much property they own
What prevents the median voter in a democracy from voting to dispossess the rich and successful
And why do the latter not erode the political power of the former
Echoes of such a tension are playing out as President Barack Obama tries to tap into middleclass anger while former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney appeals to disgruntled businesspeople
One reason that the median voter rationally agrees to protect the property of the rich may be that she sees the rich as more efficient managers of that property
So to the extent that the rich are selfmade and have come out winners in a fair competitive and transparent market society may be better off allowing them to own and manage their wealth while getting a reasonable share as taxes
The more however that the rich are seen as idle or crooked  as having simply inherited or worse gained their wealth nefariously  the more the median voter should be willing to vote for tough regulations and punitive taxes on them
In today Russia for example property rights do not enjoy widespread popular support because so many of the country fabulously wealthy oligarchs are seen as having acquired their wealth through dubious means
They grew rich because they managed the system not because they managed their businesses well
When the government goes after a rich oil tycoon like Mikhail Khodorkovsky few voices are raised in protest
And as the rich kowtow to the authorities to protect their wealth a strong check on official arbitrariness disappears
Government is free to become more autocratic
Now consider a competitive freeenterprise system with a level playing field for all
Such a system generally tends to permit the most efficient to acquire wealth
The fairness of the competition improves perceptions of legitimacy
Moreover under conditions of fair competition the process of creative destruction tends to pull down badly managed inherited wealth replacing it with new and dynamic wealth
Great inequality built up over generations does not become a source of great popular resentment
On the contrary everyone can dream that they too will become rich
When such aspirations seem plausible the system gains added democratic support
The rich confident of popular legitimacy can then use the independence that accompanies wealth to limit arbitrary government and protect democracy
Free enterprise and democracy sustain each other
There is a popular belief that democratic systems support property and enterprise because votes and legislators can be bought and the capitalists have the money
But that view is probably wrong
As Russia suggests without popular support wealth is protected only by increasingly coercive measures
Ultimately such a system loses any vestige of either democracy or free enterprise
Back then to America presidential election
The recent crisis followed by huge bailouts of financial institutions has raised questions about how at least one segment of business  the bankers  make their money
As the misdeeds of anksters come to light the system no longer seems fair
Moreover the American Dream seems to be slipping out of reach in part because a good education which seems to be the passport to prosperity is increasingly unaffordable for many in the middle class
This erodes support for the freeenterprise system
Obama understands this which explains his appeal to and focus on the middle class
He is the standard bearer for democracy
On the other hand successful professionals and entrepreneurs believe that they have come by their wealth legitimately
They are the working rich and dislike the growing burden of regulations and the prospect of higher taxes
They feel like they are being blamed for their success and they resent it
Romney understands that America strength relies heavily on free enterprise
Ordinarily there would be no contest here
The weight of votes in the middle class would carry the day
The middle class however is divided some want to protect whatever entitlements and property they already have while others want the government to give them a fairer chance
Moreover the Supreme Court Citizens United decision in  which allows unlimited independent political expenditure by organizations like corporations or unions has helped Romney more than Obama
Whatever the outcome of the election the tension between democracy and free enterprise that is central to it does not bode well for either
A freeenterprise system that is sustained only by the moneyed power of the successful is not stable and unlikely to remain vibrant for long
The United States needs to restore the possibility of achieving the American Dream for its middle class even while it reaffirms the historically light regulation and relatively low tax burden that have allowed enterprise to flourish
The virtue of democracy is that debate may lead to just such a consensus
We can only hope
The Heat Age
BERLIN  This April was the hottest April on record globally for at least  years according to the worldwide temperature records maintained by NASA and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA
The past twelve months was the hottest month period since measurements began
That is what the data from weather stations and ships show
But if you prefer satellite data the picture is similar
Satellite data have this March the hottest March on record with April ranking secondhottest the surface data have it the other way round with March the secondhottest and April the hottest
Of course more important scientifically are the longterm trends
For the past  years  that how long the satellite measurements have been taken  the trend is clearly upward and similar in magnitude in all the available data sets
Should you still have doubts that the planet is heating up look at the shrinking mountain glaciers around the world or the declining seaice cover on the Arctic Ocean which in recent summers has been little more than half its size in the 
What is causing this climatic warming
Physics tells us if you want to know why it is getting warmer seek the source of heat
That a consequence of the first law of thermodynamics energy is always conserved
We thus have to look at the heat balance of our planet to understand the reason for the warming
That is surprisingly simple there is only one source of heat coming in and that is radiation from the sun which is largely visible light or what physicists call shortwave radiation
And there is only one form of heat leaving the planet and that is radiative heat which is invisible or what physicists call longwave radiation
They are essentially the same physical phenomenon the difference in wavelength comes only from the sun being much hotter than Earth
So could changes in solar radiation explain the warming of the planet
Measurements of incoming solar radiation show that it has not increased in the past  years  in fact the record even shows a small decrease
But the record predominant feature is the recurrence of solar radiation cycles lasting about  years called Schwabe cycles after the astronomer who discovered them in 
In the past few years wee been in the deepest and longest minimum of a Schwabe cycle since satellite measurements began
That right while global temperatures are at a record high the sun has been at its dimmest in decades
Changes in solar activity clearly cannot explain global warming
But that leaves another factor affecting incoming solar radiation how much gets reflected back into space by ice snow clouds desert sand and other bright mirrorlike surfaces
Indeed a part of the observed warming is due to less reflection as snow and ice cover has shrunk
This allows more solar heat to be taken up in the climate system which is one reason why the Arctic has warmed at a faster rate than other parts of the world
But shrinking snow and ice cover is itself a result of warming so reduced reflection of solar rays is not the primary cause of warming
Rather it is a feedback that amplifies warming
Humans have altered the brightness of the Earth  as seen from space  in more direct ways
But converting forest to farmland which is brighter than forest and adding smog particles to the atmosphere which reflect sunlight have increased the reflection of solar radiation thus tending to offset some of the global warming that would otherwise have occurred
So we are left with the second part of the planetary heat budget radiative heat escaping to space
That can be changed by adding heattrapping gases to the atmosphere  the socalled greenhouse gases which absorb longwave radiation on its way out and send some of it back towards the surface
The importance of this reenhouse effect has been known in science since the nineteenth century when Joseph Fourier coined the term
Perhaps nobody has described it more succinctly than the British physicist John Tyndall who was the first to measure the effect in his laboratory in  for a number of gases including CO
He wrote he atmosphere admits of the entrance of solar heat but checks its exit and the result is a tendency to accumulate heat at the surface of the planet
We know from measurements that greenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth atmosphere
Carbondioxide levels are onethird higher now than at any time in the past million years owing to our industrial emissions
We can calculate how much this has changed the Earth heat balance
Voil just the amount to explain the observed warming
That is one of several reasons why hardly any serious climate scientist doubts that greenhouse gases are the cause of global warming
In fact this warming was predicted before it was observed
The rise in CO levels has been known since 
In  the American climatologist Wallace Broecker published a paper in the journal Science entitled re We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming
There he correctly predicted hat the present cooling trend will within a decade or so give way to a pronounced warming induced by carbon dioxide and that y early in the next century CO will have driven the mean planetary temperature beyond the limits experienced during the last  years
He predicted an overall twentiethcentury global warming of  C
He was right on all counts
Many are lining up to oppose the science of global warming
But the laws of physics don surrender to opposition for the past  years global warming has unfolded as predicted by science
It will most likely continue to do so until we stop it by cutting CO emissions
The Hedge Fund Hegemon
The recent volatility in global capital markets should give pause to those who say German leaders who have been arguing for greater transparency in global hedge funds are just sore losers US and UK policymakers in particular say the German whining is nonsense and that hedge funds along with other new age financial entities such as private equity firms are key innovators in today global economy
This debate is at the cutting edge of today globalization yet it is clouded by a healthy dose of national selfinterest
With New York and London the centers of global finance the United States and Britain have enormous profits at stake
So it is convenient for them to downplay the likelihood that risks to the world financial system will be spread more evenly than the benefits
German leaders by contrast must reckon with a populace that is deeply resistant to rapid change particularly when it involves job cuts
Many German workers believe as one trade unionist recently lamented that takeovers are being driven by a philosophy of uy it strip it and flip it
To be sure the profits currently being earned by the leading financial firms are dizzyingly high
Goldman Sachs the venerable Wall Street firm at the epicenter of financial globalization paid more than  billion dollars in compensation to its  employees in  and spun out another  billion for its shareholders  a total that is greater than the annual income of most African countries
The spectacular profits on Wall Street and elsewhere in the financial industry also have a huge macroeconomic impact
The US is running an  billion annual trade deficit in traditional goods and services
Yet because Americans consistently earn a higher return on their investments abroad than foreigners earn on their US investments US debt is rising at perhaps only half the rate that it might otherwise
Even we economists who believe that global financial innovation yields huge net benefits must admit that today hedge fund boom is becoming like the tech bubble
My own recent experience is perhaps emblematic
An ddie in Los Angeles sent me an email asking if I wanted to serve on the advisory board to his new hedge fund
Eddie accompanying flattery aside I would normally trash such a letter figuring it was a fraud or scam of some kind
However my curiosity was piqued when I noticed a missing attachment outlining the firm planned investment strategy
I shot a line back requesting the missing attachment
I should have stifled myself Eddie figuring he had a live one sent the missing attachment with a note saying e are so glad someone of your stature might be interested and by the way if you have any friends or colleagues who might be interested could you please forward this email to them also
The point is that in today gogo ultrahigh liquidity environment Eddie was probably successful in raising money with similar techniques
Of course roughly  of the world  hedge funds went out of business last year
The big question is whether this Wild West mentality poses broader risks to the global financial system particularly given circumstances where a large number of firms are all collectively making the same bet
If they lose a long string of bankruptcies can cut deeply into banking systems that had generated huge profits by lending to these same hedge funds
At the moment the most glaring weakness is the socalled en carry trade
Hedge funds have borrowed hundreds of billions of dollars at ultralow interest rate in Japan and invested the proceeds in countries like Brazil and Turkey where interest rates are high
As long as the yen remains weak this investment strategy will be a money machine
But if the yen appreciates sharply as it easily could given Japan huge current account surplus some hedge funds will suffer huge capital losses and the yen carry trade will implode
And while today main risk is the yen in a couple months it could be something completely different
So pressure outside the US and Britain to put the hedge fund industry on a tighter regulatory leash is hardly surprising
The Germans for example want to reduce risk by forcing hedge funds to adhere to stricter reporting requirements
The funds respond to such proposals by arguing that if they are required to reveal their investment strategies they will lose their incentive to innovate and a recent US government report  a multiagency effort headed by Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson formerly of Goldman Sachs  supports that position
Greater regulation would be a mistake the report argues because the global economy best defense against systemic risk is the exercise of common sense and ue diligence by each and every person who invests or interacts with hedge funds
In other words the US is telling investors to carry their own guns because as in the Wild West there might not be a sheriff around to help
But frankly as we are reminded by recent events it is hard to see how at least a small increase in transparency can hurt
The Germans in chairing the G this year should not surrender on this issue
No country wants to put itself at the mercy of the likes of Eddie
The Heirs of Inequality
ROME  It has long been known that spurts of rapid economic growth can increase inequality China and India are the latest examples
But might slow growth and rising inequality  the two most salient characteristics of developed economies nowadays  also be connected
That is the intriguing hypothesis of a recent study by the French economist Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics
Piketty has done some of the most important work on inequality in recent years
Taking advantage of the French bureaucracy precision Piketty was able to reconstruct the French national accounts over nearly two centuries
The economy from  until World War I  a kind of second ancien regime  had two striking features slow growth  about  a year  and an outsize share of inherited wealth which accounted for roughly  of GDP
The link between low growth and the importance of inheritance Piketty argues was not coincidental with inherited wealth yielding  a year and new investment only  social mobility was extremely limited and stratification was encouraged
That began to change with WWI when growth picked up  a trend that accelerated sharply after World War II
With annual economic growth running as high as  during the post boom inherited wealth shrank to only  of French GDP ushering in a period of relative mobility and equality
Ominously however during the past two decades of slow growth the share of inherited wealth has rebounded to about  of France economy
This pattern should be a cause for concern because annual GDP growth in the eurozone during the past decade has averaged about 
Similarly average annual growth in the United States has slowed from around  between  and  to roughly  since then
Joseph Stiglitz the Nobel Prizewinning economist also believes that low growth and inequality are interconnected but he believes that the causal arrow moves in the opposite direction
As he put it in a recent interview  think it inequality that causing low growth
In his new book The Price of Inequality he writes that olitics have shaped the market and shaped it in ways that advantage the top at the expense of the rest
Rentseeking the ability of entrenched elites to allocate resources to themselves and smother opportunity for others invariably leads to a less competitive market and lower growth
There is some support for this argument in Piketty work the French economy takes off after WWI and again after WWII both periods in which the French political system opened up and enacted progressive reforms
But according to Ilyana Kuziemko an economist at Princeton University there is also evidence that low growth does indeed increase inequality
Publicopinion data and experimental research indicate that people or at least Americans become less favorable to income redistribution during economic hard times
Gallup polls for example show support in the US for reducing inequality falling from  to  during the current recession despite all of the public rhetoric  and evidence  that the top  of income earners have captured almost all of the gains from economic growth in recent years
Curiously hard times may actually trigger among the economy losers a psychological mechanism known as astplace aversion
Experimental economists have found that subjects asked to play distribution games become much less generous toward those below them when they are in secondtolast place
They would rather distribute money to those above them on the totem pole than help those at the bottom to surpass them
This finding dovetails with the work of Harvard University Benjamin Friedman who argues in The Moral Consequences of Growth that conomic growth more often than not fosters greater opportunity tolerance of diversity social mobility commitment to fairness and dedication to democracy
Similarly lack of growth tends to breed xenophobia intolerance and a negative attitude toward the poor  the US and Europe in recent decades serve as cases in point for Friedman
eople in the th percentile are desperate not to fall into the th or tenth percentile he concludes
Thus a slowgrowthhighinequality economy may become a selfperpetuating cycle
But both Stiglitz and Piketty do not think that it must be so
irst of all the Scandinavian countries which have the greatest equality are also among the fastestgrowing advanced economies and take the example of Japan which has experienced deflation for about  years but successfully maintained a decent level of equality and standard of living Stiglitz argues
Piketty believes that the key may lie in making a psychological adjustment to a period of slower growth e may need to accept the fact that the postWWII years of  and  annual growth were the exception and that  annual growth  after allowing for population growth  is much more the norm
Indeed Piketty argues that our bsession with growth merely erves as an excuse for not doing anything about health about education or about redistribution
And it is an obsession rooted very much in the present
e forget that for centuries growth was essentially zero he writes
ne percent real growth means doubling the size of your economy every  or  years
Piketty sees that as grounds o be a little optimistic
But as he suggests the share of inherited wealth may turn out to be a strong indicator of whether that rate of growth will be enough to ensure greater social mobility and reduce economic inequality

The Hero of His Time
Boris Yeltsin was utterly unique
Russia first democratically elected leader he was also the first Russian leader to give up power voluntarily and constitutionally to a successor
But he was also profoundly characteristic of Russian leaders
Using various mixtures of charisma statecraft and terror Peter the Great Catherine the Great Alexander II Peter Stolypin the last tsar prime minister Lenin and Stalin all sought to make Russia not only a great military power but also an economic and cultural equal of the West
Yeltsin aimed for the same goal
But he stands out from them in this respect he understood that empire was incompatible with democracy and so was willing to abandon the Soviet Union in order to try to build a democratic order at home
At the height of Yeltsin career many Russians identified with his bluntness impulsiveness sensitivity to personal slight even with his weakness for alcohol
And yet in the final years of his rule his reputation plunged
Only in the last few months of his second presidential term after he launched the second war in Chechnya in September  did he and his lieutenants regain some legitimacy in the eyes of the Russian public while causing revulsion among any remaining Western admirers
Despite his caprices however Yeltsin kept Russia on a course of broad strategic cooperation with America and its allies
Although he opposed America use of force against Iraq and Serbia in the  his government never formally abandoned the sanctions regime against either country
Moreover no nuclear weapons were unleashed deliberately or accidentally and no fullscale war of the kind that ravaged postcommunist Yugoslavia broke out between Russia and any of its neighbors although several of them were locked in internal or regional conflict in which Russia hand was visible
The tasks that faced Yeltsin when he attained power in  were monumental
At several crucial moments he established himself as the only person who could rise to the challenges of transforming Russia from a dictatorship into a democracy from a planned economy into a free market and from an empire into a mediumranked power
In  as the emerging Russian Federation teetered on the brink of economic and monetary collapse he opted for radical reform prompting a backlash from vested interest groups
In the years that followed he would tilt toward liberal economics whenever he felt powerful enough to do so
Yeltsin was quintessentially a product of the Soviet system which makes his turn to democracy and the free market though imperfect even more miraculous
The son of a poor building worker he had a meteoric rise through communist ranks to become party boss in the industrial city of Sverdlovsk now Yekaterinburg in the Urals
Unlike most other party leaders he was good at talking to ordinary people a skill that helped him win support and then power later but he also showed no sign of questioning the MarxistLeninist gobbledygook that he was required to recite at public events
It was only after Mikhail Gorbachev summoned Yeltsin to Moscow in  that he began to differentiate himself from dozens of other senior party apparatchiks
Sensing the bitter frustration of Moscow middle classinwaiting Yeltsin quickly gained a reputation as a harsh if not always coherent critic of the party old guard
Campaigners for democracy admired Yeltsin struggle against the conservatives in the politburo  especially after he was forced out of the party inner circle in November 
Determined to outbid Gorbachev as a reformer he persuaded liberals to overcome their distrust of his provincial manners
They gave him lessons in democratic theory while he gave them tactical advice
As the Soviet Union steadily disintegrated with virtually all of its  republics straining at the leash Yeltsin gained the leadership of the largest  the Russian Federation  which placed him in a tactical alliance with independence campaigners in Ukraine the Baltic states and Georgia
By June  after quashing a series of challenges to his leadership he became the first elected president of Russia two months later real power fell into his hands after the failed putsch against Gorbachev of August  by conservatives seeking to prevent the Soviet Union disintegration
For most Westerners and many Russians his finest hour came on August th that year when he stood on a tank outside the Russian parliament and defied the hardliners who had seized power
But Yeltsin himself never succeeded in fully throwing off the intellectual shackles of the past
As president he talked of economic performance as if it could be improved by decree
Like most Russians he wanted the material advantages of capitalism but had little respect or understanding for the rule of law and dispersion of power which makes capitalist institutions work
Nevertheless for most of his presidency Yeltsin kept alive  albeit with many tactical retreats  the goal of economic reform
At some level he sensed that Russia potential could be unleashed only if the government either faced down or bought off the special interests  military industrial and agricultural  that stood in the way
The economic orthodoxy pursued after the collapse of  laid the groundwork for today sustained Russian boom
Yeltsin tragedy and Russia was that when the country needed a leader with vision and determination it found an agile political operator instead
By not permitting Russia to disintegrate into anarchy or leading it back to authoritarianism Yeltsin kept the way open for such a leader to one day emerge
Unfortunately that man is not his handpicked successor Vladimir Putin who has only perpetuated the vicious cycles of Russian history
The Hidden Costs of Money
PRINCETON  When people say that oney is the root of all evil they usually don mean that money itself is the root of evil
Like Saint Paul from whom the quote comes they have in mind the love of money
Could money itself whether we are greedy for it or not be a problem
Karl Marx thought so
In The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of  a youthful work that remained unpublished and largely unknown until the midtwentieth century Marx describes money as he universal agent of separation because it transforms human characteristics into something else
A man may be ugly Marx wrote but if he has money he can buy for himself he most beautiful of women
Without money presumably some more positive human qualities would be needed
Money alienates us Marx thought from our true human nature and from our fellow human beings
Marx reputation sank once it became evident that he was wrong to predict that a workers revolution would usher in a new era with a better life for everyone
So if we had only his word for the alienating effects of money we might feel free to dismiss it as an element of a misguided ideology
But research by Kathleen Vohs Nicole Mead and Miranda Goode reported in Science in  suggests that on this point at least Marx was onto something
In a series of experiments Vohs and her colleagues found ways to get people to think about money without explicitly telling them to do so
They gave some people tasks that involved unscrambling phrases about money
With others they left piles of Monopoly money nearby
Another group saw a screensaver with various denominations of money
Other people randomly selected unscrambled phrases that were not about money did not see Monopoly money and saw different screensavers
In each case those who had been led to think about money  let call them he money group  behaved differently from those who had not
When given a difficult task and told that help was available people in the money group took longer to ask for help
When asked for help people in the money group spent less time helping
When told to move their chair so that they could talk with someone else people in the money group left a greater distance between chairs
When asked to choose a leisure activity people in the money group were more likely to choose an activity that could be enjoyed alone rather than one that involved others
Finally when people in the money group were invited to donate some of the money they had been paid for participation in the experiment they gave less than those who had not been induced to think about money
Trivial reminders of money made a surprisingly large difference
For example where the control group would offer to spend an average of  minutes helping someone with a task those primed to think about money offered only  minutes
Similarly when someone pretending to be another participant in the experiment asked for help the money group spent only half as much time helping her
When asked to make a donation from their earnings the money group gave just a little over half as much as the control group
Why does money makes us less willing to seek or give help or even to sit close to others
Vohs and her colleagues suggest that as societies began to use money the necessity of relying on family and friends diminished and people were able to become more selfsufficient
n this way they conclude oney enhanced individualism but diminished communal motivations an effect that is still apparent in people responses today
That not much of an explanation of why being reminded of money should make so much difference to how we behave given that we all use money everyday
There seems to be something going on here that we still don fully understand
I am not pleading for a return to the simpler days of barter or selfsufficiency
Money enables us to trade  and thus to benefit from each other special skills and advantages
Without money we would be immeasurably poorer and not only in a financial sense
But now that we are aware of the isolating power that even the thought of money can have we can no longer think of money role as being entirely neutral
If for example a local parents organization wants to build a children playground should it ask its members to do the work on a voluntary basis or should it launch a fundraising campaign so that an outside contractor can be employed
Harvard economist Roland Fryer proposal to pay poor students for doing well at school is another area where using money is open to question
If money were neutral this would be just a question of whether the benefits of using money outweigh the financial costs
Often they will  for example if the parents lack the skills to build a good playground
But it would be a mistake to assume that allowing money to dominate every sphere of life comes without other costs that are difficult to express in financial terms
The Hidden Future of the US Economy
CAMBRIDGE  Just how bad is the outlook for the United States economy
Unfortunately you cannot tell from the forecasts
These days it is common to read forecasts predicting that the US economy will grow at a  annual rate in the coming year
But just what does that mean
The forecaster is not saying that he or she is confident that growth will be exactly 
Every forecaster recognizes that the actual growth rate may be higher or lower than the number that he states
There is a distribution of possible growth rates and the forecaster is telling us just one of the outcomes that he can contemplate
But if a forecaster tells us that he xpects a growth rate of  does that mean that he thinks that it is as likely to be above  as it is to be below   the edian as he sees it of the distribution of possible growth rates
Or could it mean that the he thinks the most likely growth rate will be close to  the odal value even though he may believe that it is much more likely to be less than that value than to be greater
Many forecasters currently believe that there is a significant probability that the economy will slump during the next  months  a ouble dip in the expansion process
It is possible for them to hold that view and still forecast  growth for the next  months as the most likely outcome or the edian of their probability distribution
Any decision maker who depends on forecasts  a businessman an investor or a government official  needs to know the probability of very low or very high growth rates as well as the median forecast
But that information remains hidden
Some surveys of forecasts report the distribution of the forecasts of the different individuals being surveyed
We might read that the average forecast of  different forecasters is  with the five highest forecasts above  and the five lowest forecasts below 
While that is useful information it does not say anything about the extent to which each forecaster believes that growth might turn out to be less than  or even less than zero
Recent US data have clearly raised the probability that the economy will run out of steam and decline during the next  months
The key reason for increased pessimism is that the government stimulus programs that raised spending since the summer of  are now coming to an end
As they have wound down spending has declined
The government programs failed to provide the umppriming role that was intended
They provided an early spark but it looks like the spark did not catch
For example a tax subsidy for car purchases caused GDP to rise in the third quarter of  with more than twothirds of the increase attributable to motorvehicle production
But now that the subsidies have ended the level of both sales and production has declined
A recent survey of consumers reported the lowest level of intended car buying in more than  years
Although annual GDP growth was  in the first quarter of this year almost all of it reflected inventory accumulation  some of which no doubt was unwanted buildup caused by disappointing sales
When inventory accumulation is excluded firstquarter growth of inal sales was just  in annual terms  and  compared to the fourth quarter of 
The second quarter benefited from a surge in home purchases as individuals rushed to take advantage of the tax subsidy for home buyers that expired in April
But what will happen in the third quarter and beyond now that that program has ended
While it would be rash to forecast a double dip as the most likely outcome for the economy during the rest of this year many of us are raising the odds that we attribute to such a downturn Unfortunately those forecasts of what might happen remain hidden
The Hidden Purposes of High Finance
BERKELEY  No one questions the usefulness of ow finance the ability to use checks banknotes and credit cards rather than having to cart around chests of silver scales and reagents to assay purity and needing armed guards to protect the silver  and more guards to watch the first set of guards  has obvious efficiencies
So does the ability of households to borrow and lend in order not to be forced to match income and expenditure every day week month or year
But what use is igh finance
Economists conventional description depicts high finance as providing us with three types of utility
First it allows for many savers to pool their wealth to finance large enterprises that can achieve the efficiencies of scale possible from capitalintensive modern industry
Second high finance provides an arena to curb the worst abuses by managers of large corporations
Shareholder democracy simply does not work but managers fear that if the stock price drops too low they will be out on their ears provides a useful restraint
Finally high finance allows for portfolio diversification so that individual investors can seek high expected returns without being forced to assume large idiosyncratic risks of bankruptcy and poverty
But these are the benefits of high finance as they apply to the ideal world of economists  that is a world of rational utilitarian actors who are skilled calculators of expected utility under uncertainty who are masters of dynamic programming and who breathe stochastic calculus in their daily life
We do not live in such a world
Economists have spent their lives attempting to evolve theories that would account for how salient features of reality might emerge if we did live in their ideal world but since we don their theoretical enterprise is of doubtful utility
It is like describing how one could bake a delicious wedding cake using only honey bicarbonate of soda and raw eggplant
If we take the world as it really is we quickly see that high finance performs two further tasks that advance our collective economic welfare
It induces us to save accumulate and invest by promising us safe and liquid investments even in extraordinary times
It also induces us to save and invest as a prerequisite to indulging our love of gambling and as a byproduct of it
It is a fact that we are much happier saving and accumulating and that we are much more likely to do so when we think that the resources we have saved and accumulated are at hand
It is also true that when we invest our wealth  in Pfizer intellectual property factories in Shenzhen worldwide distribution networks or shopping malls in Atlanta  it is not  in fact at hand
Our invested wealth can only be made to appear liquid to any one of us and only if there is no general shift in our collective desire for liquidity
And it is also a fact that we are happier saving and accumulating if we receive positive and negative feedback on our decisions on a time scale that allows us to believe that we can do better next time by altering our strategy  hence marketwatchcom and CNNMoney
Of course investors who believe that their wealth is securely liquid and that they are adding value for themselves by buying and selling are suffering from a delusion
Our financial wealth is not liquid in an emergency
And when we buy and sell we are enriching not ourselves but the specialists and market makers
But we benefit from these delusions
Psychologically we are naturally impatient so it is good for us to believe that our wealth is safe and secure and that we can add to it through skillful acts of investment because that delusion makes us behave less impatiently
And collectively that delusion boosts our savings and thus our capital stock which on turn boosts all of our wages and salaries as well
Seventythree years ago John Maynard Keynes thought about the reform and regulation of financial markets from the perspective of the first three purposes and found himself oved toward making the purchase of an investment permanent and indissoluble like marriage
But he immediately drew back the fact hat each individual investor flatters himself that his commitment is iquid though this cannot be true for all investors collectively calms his nerves and makes him much more willing to run a risk
Moreover for Keynes the game of professional investment is intolerably boring and overexacting to anyone who is entirely exempt from the gambling instinct whilst he who has it must pay to this propensity the appropriate toll
It is for these reasons that we have seemed frozen for the past generation or two whenever we have contemplated reforming our system of financial regulation
And it is why even in the face of a severe financial crisis we remain frozen today
The High Cost of Cheap Fashion
OXFORD  I confess I do it too
Like most Western women I do it regularly and it is a guilty pleasure every time
It is hard to listen to one conscience when one is faced with so much incredible temptation
I am talking of course about cheap trendy fashion
Ill visit a Zara  or HampampM or now that I am in the United Kingdom for the summer the amazing Primark  and snap up items that are ute effectively disposable and so shockingly inexpensive that one does a double take
I need to face my addiction  and so do all women like me
Fashion has been transformed by the recent emergence of retail chains that hire good designers to make throwaway clothing and accessories that are right on trend
This evolution has freed Western women from the tyranny of a fashion industry that in the bad old days would dictate a style compelling women to invest heavily in updating their wardrobes and then blithely declare their entire closets obsolete  again and again with no end in sight
Enter the massproduction style emporia and Western women have the seemingly delicious and liberating option of getting this summers musthave tiny floral retro eighties print sundress  which will look appallingly frumpy by next summer  for 
They  we an invest in classic items that don age so fast and absorb these lowcost trendy disposables as the mood hits
These stores solve a psychological problem for us too since one can shop at length  a pleasure that may well be hardwired in the female brain owing to our evolutionary development as gatherers  without feeling sick about one overspending by the end of the exercise
But what has been liberating for Western women is a system built literally on the backs of women in the developing world
How do Primark and its competitors in the West shopping malls and High Streets keep that cute frock so cheap
By starving and oppressing Bangladeshi Chinese Mexican Haitian and other women that how
We all know that cheap clothing is usually made in sweatshop conditions  and usually by women
And we know  or should know  that women in sweatshops around the world report being locked in and forbidden to use bathrooms for long periods as well as sexual harassment violent unionbusting and other forms of coercion
But like any family secret that would cause us discomfort if faced directly we Western women turn a blind eye to it
Boycotts of sweated college tshirts in the United States led to fairer manufacturing practices and boycotts of coffee and produce led mostly by women consumers resulted in fairtrade purchases by major supermarkets
And more affluent women do have a history of effective sweated labor boycotts in the past in the Victorian era impoverished women were going blind in the needle trades turning out elaborate embroideries for wealthy women until revulsion on the part of these consumers forced conditions to better
By contrast today there is no major movement led by developedworld women to stop this global exploitation by cutrate manufacturers  even though our money is the one tool powerful enough to force manufacturers to change their ways
The reason is simple we like things the way they are
But it will become increasingly difficult for us to maintain our ut of sight out of mind attitude
To their credit women in the developing world  some of the most exploited and coerced women on earth  are raising their voices
For example The Financial Times reported on June  that undreds of Bangladeshi garment factories supplying western buyers such as Marks and Spencer Tesco Walmart and HampampM gradually reopened under heavy police protectionfter days of violent protests by tens of thousands of laborers demanding higher wages
A thousand riot police used rubber bullets and tear gas on the workers and hundreds were injured but they did not back down
Most of the two million people working in Bangladesh garment industry are women and they are the lowestpaid garment workers in the world earning  a month
But they are demanding that their monthly wage be almost tripled to 
Their leaders make the point that at current pay levels workers cannot feed themselves or their families
Economists predict that strikes and unrest will escalate in Bangladesh and also in Vietnamwith even investment bankers quoted by The Financial Times calling wages for women garment workers in these countries nsustainably low
The factories have reopened  for now
But Bangladesh government is considering an increase in the minimum wage
If it happens one of the world most oppressed legal workforces will have scored a major victory  largely symbolic for now but one that will inspire other women garment workers around the world to rise up in protest
Western women we should challenge ourselves to follow this story and find ways to do what is right in changing our own consumption patterns
It is past time to show support for women who are suffering systematic globalized costeffective gender discrimination in the most overt ways  ways that most of us no longer have to face
Let us support a fairtrade economy and refuse to shop at outlets targeted by activists for unfair employment practices for more information go to httpwwwworldwatchorgnode
If women around the world who are held in the bondage of sweated labor manage to win this crucial fight that cute dress at Primark may cost a fair amount more
But it already costs too much to the women who can afford to feed and house themselves and their children
That  pair of adorable laceup sandals
The price  given the human costs  really is too good to be true
The High Cost of Feeling Low
Depression is according to a World Health Organization study the world fourth worst health problem measured by how many years of good health it causes to be lost
By  it is likely to rank second behind heart disease
Yet not nearly enough is being done to treat or prevent it
The study led by Saba Moussavi and published last month in The Lancet  also revealed that depression has more impact on the physical health of those who suffer from it than major chronic diseases like angina diabetes arthritis and asthma
Yet in the same issue of The Lancet  Gavin Andrews and Nickolai Titov researchers at the University of New South Wales reported that Australians with depression are far less likely to receive an acceptable level of care than patients with arthritis or asthma
This pattern is consistent with reports from other developed nations
Treating depression is often if not always effective and without it those who suffer from depression cannot live happy fulfilling lives
But even in narrow costbenefit terms it makes sense to spend more on treating depression
A study of  European countries found that depression cost them  billion in  or  of their combined GDP
The cost of treating depression accounted for only  of this huge sum
A much larger share was lost productivity
Richard Layard of the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics has said that mental illness is Britain biggest social problem costing  of GDP
He estimates that while treatment may cost  per patient over two years the result is likely to be an extra month of work worth 
Lord Layard advocates more psychotherapy rather than drug treatment
In the United States a research team headed by Philip Wang of the National Institute of Mental Health in Rockville Maryland reported similar results last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association 
Wang team conducted a randomized controlled trial that showed that depression screening  to find workers who could benefit from treatment  was costeffective reducing health insurance costs to employers decreasing absence due to sickness and increasing job retention and productivity
Depression is also costly in developing countries
In China according to a recent article by Tehwei Hu and colleagues in Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology  depression costs  billion renminbi or more than  billion per year at  prices
A few years ago a research team led by Vikram Patel reported in the British Medical Journal that depression is common in Zimbabwe where it was often known by a Shona word that means hinking too much
Around the world many primary care physicians underestimate the seriousness of depression
Many of them lack adequate training in recognizing mental illness and may not be up to date with treatments options
Patients too may fail to seek treatment because mental illness still carries a stigma that can make it harder to acknowledge than a physical illness
The problem has been aggravated in the US at least by the refusal of some health insurance policies to cover treatment for mental illness
Thus the US Senate recent approval of the ental Health Parity Act is a significant step forward
The legislation which still has to pass through the House of Representatives would require health insurance plans provided by employers to cover treatment for mental illness at a level similar to coverage for general health care
Unfortunately the legislation will do nothing for the  million Americans who have no health insurance at all
Depression is an individual tragedy that is multiplied more than  million times worldwide
So while we can and should do much better at treating it perhaps the more significant question is whether we can learn to prevent it
Some depression appears to be genetic in which case genetic therapy may ultimately offer a solution
But much mental illness appears to depend on environmental factors
Perhaps we need to focus on aspects of living that have a positive effect on mental health
Many recent studies show that spending time relaxing with family and friends contributes to how happy people are with their lives while long working hours and especially long commuting times contribute to stress and unhappiness
Of course relaxed and happy people can still become depressed and stressed and unhappy people may not be depressed but it is a reasonable hypothesis that happier people are less likely to become depressed
LaSalle Leffall who chaired the President Cancer Panel wrote to President George W Bush in August saying e can and must empower individuals to make healthy choices through appropriate policy and legislation
If that is true for encouraging healthy diets and discouraging smoking it is no less true for lifestyle choices that promote greater mental health
Governments can legislate happiness or ban depression but public policy can play a role in ensuring that people have time to relax with friends and pleasant places to do it
The Price of War with Iran
WASHINGTON DC  One of the greatest challenges that US President Barack Obama will face in his second term is Iran pursuit of advanced nuclear technologies
While a nuclear Iran would damage America strategic position in the Middle East action aimed at forestalling Iran nuclear progress also carries serious strategic and economic consequences
Armed with nuclear weapons Iran would be better able to project influence intimidate its neighbors and protect itself
As a result the United States allies in the region would need new security guarantees
But an increased American presence could provoke radical groups while requiring defense resources that are needed to support US interests in East and Southeast Asia
Some of Obama conservative critics believe that he will allow Iran to develop an advanced nuclear program provided that it stops short of actually building a bomb
But no American president would want their legacy to include allowing so unfriendly a regime to acquire such a dangerous weapon  even if doing so meant avoiding greater strategic costs
Indeed Obama has repeatedly avowed that he will stop Iran from acquiring nuclearweapons capability rather than allow the country to develop its nuclear program and then rely on deterrence as has been done with other nuclear powers
But such tough rhetoric might create a dilemma for Obama
If Iran continues on its path toward nuclear arms war may well become inevitable whether instigated by Israel or the US or provoked by Iran erratic foreign policy
Although the costs of a containment strategy would be significant the costs of fighting a war would be higher
Iran has threatened to seal the Strait of Hormuz  through which  of the world internationally traded oil passes  if it is attacked
While it would be difficult for Iran to seal the strait for long if it managed to do so at all it could easily make passage unsafe with attacks by small boats sea mines and missiles launched from coastal mountains
Furthermore Iran would likely strike the pipelines in the Arabian Peninsula that would otherwise allow oil to bypass the strait
And several strategically crucial oilprocessing facilities are within range of Iranian missiles and special forces including the Saudi oilstabilization facility at Abqaiq which processes seven million barrels daily
Such a response would immediately cause oil prices to spike  possibly to  per barrel in the short run
A protracted conflict could mean sustained prices of roughly  per barrel
Given that Americans consume roughly  million barrels of oil daily a mere  increase in the price per barrel would sap  billion per week from the US economy jeopardizing its alreadyfragile recovery
America has already financed two wars on credit contributing to a significant fiscal deficit
Another war would eliminate what little hope there is of achieving debt stability without drastic  and harmful  spending cuts or tax increases
Surging oil prices would also threaten Europe and other major oilimporting countries including China India Japan and South Korea thereby lowering or reversing their economic growth
Iran own economy which depends heavily on oil exports would also suffer
The conflict would likely drag on given that the definition of victory in this scenario is ambiguous
Would America win by destroying Iran nuclear facilities even if reconstruction began immediately
What if Iran incited unrest in its neighbors jeopardizing USallied regimes in the region
Is a settlement with Iran leaders feasible or is regime change crucial to an American victory
And in the latter case would the US follow its pattern of ousting a Middle Eastern government without a succession plan
Regardless of the goal the end result would be more troops and ships in the region more resources appropriated to fight new or revitalized terrorist organizations and more arms for allied countries many of which are themselves unstable
America stake in the Middle East would grow undermining its attempts to free up assets for its professed ivot toward Asia where it hopes to balance China growing influence
Living with a nuclear Iran would require expensive countermeasures and create significant risks
But going to war to impede Iran nuclear ambitions and containing the subsequent chaos  including oilprice spikes increased regional volatility and reduced American strategic flexibility  would be far more costly
If Obama stands behind his firstterm declarations the world will pay a very high price
Sustainability at a Profit
NAIROBI  How profitable are the world major industrial and agricultural sectors
According to a new report by the Londonbased consultancy Trucost when one accounts for these sectors costs to third parties in the form of environmental and other damages the answer is ot very
Many sectors seem lucrative when conventional economic calculations are used
For example pretax profit margins for iron steel and cement production and for crudeoil and naturalgas extraction range from roughly  to nearly 
But after factoring in externalities the global cement sector has average pretax losses of  and crudeoil and naturalgas extraction barely break even
Indeed Trucost report estimates that the top  environmental externalities worldwide  including greenhousegas emissions naturalresource depletion deforestation climate change and air pollutionrelated health problems  cost the global economy roughly  trillion annually
But such losses are rarely captured in the balance sheets of the companies concerned
Rather they are passed on to taxpayers the poor and in the form of a degraded planet future generations
Among the sectors with the highest impact in this regard are coalburning power plants in East Asia and North America with externalities totaling  billion and  billion respectively  higher than the value of the electricity that they produce
Cattle ranching and farming in Latin America is the third most damaging sector with losses linked to deforestation of  billion  more than  times the value of the sector annual output of  billion
Calculations for waterintensive industries such as corn rice or wheat farming in dry regions like North Africa and Southeast Asia and for energyintensive sectors including cement production and iron and steel milling are similarly sobering
Although the developing world is generating a significant proportion of these costs the goods that result are consumed worldwide
Thus addressing externalities should be regarded as a global challenge to be addressed jointly by governments producers and consumers
At last year Rio summit in Brazil leaders of governments businesses and NGOs agreed to a range of measures that will expose the costs of major economic sectors activities to an increasingly engaged public
At the same time countries are working to devise a new comprehensive wealth indicator that extends beyond GDP to account for some of these externalities
Moreover several countries with support from the United Nations Environment Program and the Global Reporting Initiative have launched programs to boost corporate sustainability reporting
Such reporting will provide pension funds and other investors  as well as ratings agencies  with a better understanding of companies longterm risk factors
Given rising naturalresource scarcity and the escalating risk of supplychain disruption owing to extreme weather events linked to climate change companies can no longer afford to ignore their activities externalities
Forwardthinking business leaders already recognize that in the twentyfirst century competitiveness will hinge largely on using natural resources more efficiently and cutting carbon emissions
In addition to the obvious benefits this approach will bring reputational advantages as consumers  whether through education or firsthand experience  become increasingly aware of the environmental and social impact of the goods and services that they purchase
The drought in the United States in  is estimated to have caused soybean and corn losses of around  billion with costs to consumers rising more than  billion as a result of higher grain and oilseed prices
Companies that adhere to unsustainable damaging practices  and continue to pass on the associated costs to consumers  may find that their customers start shopping elsewhere
Externalizing the impact of production  whether in power generation or agriculture  was perhaps easier when the global population was only a few billion and with most people living in countries with undeveloped economies the supply of natural resources seemed unlimited
But with naturalresource stocks dwindling economies developing at breakneck pace and the global population set to exceed nine billion by  the need to decouple economic growth from resource consumption and move toward a lowcarbon resourceefficient green economy has become acute
From the depletion of fish stocks to the inexorable buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere there is no shortage of evidence that current systems are unsustainable and that corporations  which account for twothirds of the global economy and use the vast majority of the planet resources  must transform the way they do business
The Trucost assessment brings into sharp focus why
The High Stakes of Rio
NAIROBI  With just weeks to go before the Rio Earth Summit many are speculating about how many world leaders will show up and what kind of agreements they might reach on the key agenda items creating a reen economy and establishing an nternational framework for sustainable development
It is no coincidence that these two items appear side by side
The term reen economy was coined years ago  even prior to the first Earth Summit in  nbspto provide a new lens through which to examine the links between economics and sustainability
But it has gained a new impetus in a world where climate change is already a reality commodity prices are rising and basic resources such as clean air arable land and fresh water are increasingly scarce
A growing body of science including the United Nations Environment Program upcoming Global Environment Outlook is confirming what was glimpsed at Rio  years ago
Those who have invested in an economic model and production processes based on nineteenth and twentiethcentury models are perhaps understandably nervous about a paradigm shift
But so are some segments of civil society which are concerned that a transition to a green economy might negatively affect the poor and expose them to greater risks and vulnerabilities
Others question the efficacy of marketbased approaches to drive sustainability because markets can never deliver optimal social and environmental outcomes
Only strong institutions including regulations and laws can accomplish this
We couldn agree more
The systemic crises in food fuel and finance that came to a head in   and that are ongoing in many countries  have their roots in an economic paradigm that has not accounted for the value of nature and its array of lifesupporting services
As the recently released report owards a Green Economy Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication shows the market economy as currently constituted has resulted in the misallocation of capital on an unprecedented scale
Indeed the deep and pervasive market failures  in carbon emissions biodiversity and ecosystem services  are accelerating environmental risks and ecological scarcities and undermining human wellbeing and social equity
That is why the link to governance and institutions at Rio is just as important as the transition to a green economy markets are human constructs that require rules and institutions to guide not only their direction but also their boundaries
One concern among critics is that a transition to a green economy will essentially monetize nature exposing the world forests fresh water and fisheries to the profitseeking behavior of bankers and traders whose shortcomings helped to trigger the financial and economic turmoil of the past four years
But is the question one of monetizing nature or of valuing nature
The fact is that nature is already being bought and sold mined and marketed at knockdown prices that fail to capture its real worth especially to the livelihoods of the poor
In large part this reflects unregulated or missing markets that fail to capture the values that nature provides to us every day  point emphasized in the G project on the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity hosted by the UNEP
In a very real sense the future of the planet is at stake in Rio
Without a real and lasting solution that recalibrates our current economic thinking at a systemic level the scale and pace of change could soon push the planet past critical thresholds and make sustainable development everywhere an impossible dream
Although multilateralism is a slow and often painful process of cultivating consensus some issues are so large that they transcend any one country
Why for example does the world pursue a paradigm of economic growth that rests upon eroding the very basis of earth lifesupport systems
Can wealth be redefined and reframed to include access to basic goods and services including those provided by nature free of cost such as clean air a stable climate and fresh water
Is it not time to give human development environmental sustainability and social equity an equal footing with GDP growth
All around us warning lights are flashing yellow if not red
But we know that new technology and innovation are driving changes in the way that energy is produced how new markets for food and clean water are emerging and how basic ecological services are now becoming scarce and valued
Rio is a moment for sharing knowledge and experience concerning successful transitions to greener and more resourceefficient economies
It is an opportunity to begin developing the capacity at all levels to transform our economies into engines of growth and jobs that do not deplete our resources or create new liabilities that will be a drag on growth and human health for years to come
The challenge ahead will be to reconcile the emerging economic reality with the social values and ethics needed to produce a balanced and inclusive green economy
That in the words of UN SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon is a uture that we all want
It is a future that could unfold with defining and decisive leadership by world leaders at Rio
The Historical Significance of Chinaus Entry to the WTO
CAMBRIDGE Yesterday America joined Europe in agreeing on the principles of economic reform in China that will permit China to enter the World Trade Organization
This sets the stage for Chinas membership in the WTO by the end of 
Chinas addition to the WTO brings  billion people  more than onefifth of humanity  formally into the mainstream of the international economy
This is an epochal change of direction for Chinas relations to the world that trace back to events five centuries ago
For economists and historians with a long view Chinas situation in the world poses a puzzle
Simply put why is China so poor today
GNP per person averages around  compared with around  on average in the US and Europe when such calculations are made at a standardized set of prices
The puzzle is that from  to  AD Chinese civilization once led the world in technology and probably in economic wellbeing
Chinas relative decline for the last  years is one of the greatest themes of world history
Turn the clock back six centuries to the early s
China could boast technological wonders  the compass navigational abilities the printing press fireworks and explosives  that barely touched the rest of the world
Chinas state had been unified for more than  years its statecraft was considerably sophisticated
Chinese fine arts exemplified by its porcelains that would be craved by the world for centuries to come were remarkable by the standards of any age
Perhaps the greatest symbol of these accomplishments in the early years of the th century were the great naval expeditions of the Chinese fleet in which ships of monumental proportion sailed the routes of Southeast Asia to India and even to East Africa during the years  to 
Archeologists today find Chinese porcelain shards in Kenya and Tanzania
Then Chinas dominance faded
While economists historians political theorists and demographers can all add something to the puzzle my view is that more than anything China turned its back to the world
In the s China abandoned naval expeditions dismantling its fleet
The imperial court under a financial squeeze and threatened by nomadic incursions from Central Asia canceled the naval expeditions in the s moved the capital inland to Beijing and began isolating China for centuries to come
Decree followed decree eliminating the shipyards closing ports and forbidding Chinese to leave the mainland
Trade and exchange continued only at a trickle
China unilaterally abandoned its role in the world
By the time Adam Smith wrote AThe Wealth of Nations he could accurately describe China as a rich civilization held back by archaic laws of trade isolation
He noted that the Chinese held foreign commerce Ain the utmost contempt While China retreated into a shell Europe exploded on the world scene
Smith described the European discoveries of the sea passage to Asia around the southern tip of Africa and the Americas as the two greatest events in world history
Globalization was born but it was Europe not China which grabbed the lead
China squandered its economic and technological potential by itself not because of external force
By the time Europe and China crossed paths in the Opium Wars of  a technologically superior Europe had vast military advantages and so forced China into a series of unilateral humiliating concessions
Chinas imperial state and society were destabilized by European incursions
The imperial dynasty collapsed in  under external pressures and internal demands for change
Change however did not come smooth
The dynastys collapse was followed by civil strife Japans invasion of China in the s World War II civil war and thirty years of disastrous and cruel dictatorship under Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party
It wasnt until  under Deng Xiaoping that China opened up to the world
Of course Deng was more interested in economic reform than political liberalization but the liberalization of the s and s was extraordinary by any standard essentially the first time in several centuries that a sovereign China willingly adopted policies of open trade with the rest of the world
Admission of China to the WTO will consolidate the reforms started in  as China formally accepts open trade and shared rules of international economic life as a sovereign and equal member of the international community
Critics of free trade with China say that its political system remains authoritarian
They have a point but not a decisive one
China is indeed burdened by an authoritarian political system one that has been authoritarian for two millennia
Indeed only an authoritarian state could have closed China by edict for several centuries and only an authoritarian state could have led China into the disasters of manmade famine failed economic policy and cultural destruction that marked Maos rule
Chinas turn towards openness is making deep inroads creating a more open free and vibrant society than in the past
Chinas young generation and the ones that will follow will want and demand political freedoms to accompany their increased economic opportunities and participation in world events
In the coming decades Chinas opening to the world will also prove to be an opening to Chinese democracy good for China and good for the rest of us as well
The History at the End of History
Fifteen years ago in my book The End of History and the Last Man I argued that if a society wanted to be modern there was no alternative to a market economy and a democratic political system
Not everyone wanted to be modern of course and not everyone could put in place the institutions and policies necessary to make democracy and capitalism work but no alternative system would yield better results
While the  End of History  thus was essentially an argument about modernization some people have linked my thesis about the end of history to the foreign policy of President George W Bush and American strategic hegemony
But anyone who thinks that my ideas constitute the intellectual foundation for the Bush administration policies has not been paying attention to what I have been saying since  about democracy and development
President Bush initially justified intervention in Iraq on the grounds of Saddam programs to develop weapons of mass destruction the regime alleged links to alQaida as well as Iraq violation of human rights and lack of democracy
As the first two justifications crumbled in the wake of the  invasion the administration increasingly emphasized the importance of democracy both in Iraq and in the broader Middle East as a rationale for what it was doing
Bush argued that the desire for freedom and democracy were universal and not culturebound and that America would be dedicated to the support of democratic movements ith the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world
Supporters of the war saw their views confirmed in the inkstained fingers of Iraqi voters who queued up to vote in the various elections held between January and December  in the Cedar Revolution in Lebanon and in the Afghan presidential and parliamentary elections
Inspiring and hopeful as these events were the road to liberal democracy in the Middle East is likely to be extremely disappointing in the near to medium term and the Bush administration efforts to build a regional policy around it are heading toward abject failure
To be sure the desire to live in a modern society and to be free of tyranny is universal or nearly so
This is demonstrated by the efforts of millions of people each year to move from the developing to the developed world where they hope to find the political stability job opportunities health care and education that they lack at home
But this is different from saying that there is a universal desire to live in a liberal society  that is a political order characterized by a sphere of individual rights and the rule of law
The desire to live in a liberal democracy is indeed something acquired over time often as a byproduct of successful modernization
Moreover the desire to live in a modern liberal democracy does not translate necessarily into an ability to actually do so
The Bush administration seems to have assumed in its approach to postSaddam Iraq that both democracy and a market economy were default conditions to which societies would revert once oppressive tyranny was removed rather than a series of complex interdependent institutions that had to be painstakingly built over time
Long before you have a liberal democracy you have to have a functioning state something that never disappeared in Germany or Japan after they were defeated in World War II
This is something that cannot be taken for granted in countries like Iraq
The End of History was never linked to a specifically American model of social or political organization
Following Alexandre Kojve the RussianFrench philosopher who inspired my original argument I believe that the European Union more accurately reflects what the world will look like at the end of history than the contemporary United States
The EU attempt to transcend sovereignty and traditional power politics by establishing a transnational rule of law is much more in line with a osthistorical world than the Americans continuing belief in God national sovereignty and their military
Finally I never linked the global emergence of democracy to American agency and particularly not to the exercise of American military power
Democratic transitions need to be driven by societies that want democracy and since the latter requires institutions it is usually a fairly long and drawn out process
Outside powers like the US can often help in this process by the example they set as politically and economically successful societies
They can also provide funding advice technical assistance and yes occasionally military force to help the process along
But coercive regime change was never the key to democratic transition
The History Man
President George W Bush is not generally known for his firm grasp of history
But this has not stopped him from using history to justify his policies
In a recent speech to American war veterans in Kansas City he defended his aim to tay the course in Iraq by pointing out the consequences of the American withdrawal from the war in Vietnam
He also mentioned the post occupation of Japan and the Korean War as success stories in America efforts to bring freedom to Asia and by extension the world
Historians Democrats and other Bush critics were quick to denounce his speech particularly his reference to Vietnam as selfserving dishonest and inaccurate
Yet for once Bush actually hit upon a historical analogy that was true
Of course the Vietnam War was different in almost every respect from the war in Iraq
Ho Chi Minh was not Saddam Hussein
In Vietnam the United States was not invading a country but defending a corrupt authoritarian ally against an aggressive Communist regime
But what Bush actually said was that the US withdrawal from Indochina was followed by a bloodbath in Cambodia and brutal oppression in Vietnam
A withdrawal from Iraq he implied would result in similar bloodshed or worse
That is almost certainly true
However what Bush did not say is that neither the mass murders in Southeast Asia nor the potential mass murders in Iraq would have occurred without the chaos caused by US intervention
But what about the Asian success stories in Japan Korea and other places under American protection
Was Bush right to boast of America role in giving these countries their freedom
As he put it to the Kansas City veterans ill today generation of Americans resist the allure of retreat and will we do in the Middle East what the veterans in this room did in Asia
What exactly did the US do in Asia
The first few years of the occupation of Japan were indeed a remarkable success for democracy
Instead of helping Japanese of the old school restore an authoritarian system General Douglas MacArthur administration helped Japanese liberals restore and improve their prewar democratic institutions
Trade unions were given more clout
Women got the vote
Civil liberties were boosted
And the semidivine Japanese Emperor was brought down to earth
Much of the credit for this goes to the Japanese themselves and to the idealistic leftleaning New Dealers in MacArthur government who supported them
When China fell to Mao Communists however and North Korea got Chinese and Soviet backing for an invasion of the south democratic idealism was stopped in its tracks
In Japan former war criminals were released from prison eds were purged and rightwing governments led by some of those same former war criminals got enthusiastic American backing
Democracy instead of being nurtured was distorted with active American encouragement to make sure the right stayed in power and the left was kept at bay
South Koreans certainly have much to thank the Americans for
Without UN intervention in the Korean War led by the US the South would have been taken over by Kim Il Sung the Great Leader and their current freedom and prosperity would never have been possible
But South Korean democracy was not something the US gave to the Koreans or even always encouraged
From the late  to the late  the US played along with and sometimes actively backed antiCommunist authoritarian rulers who grabbed and consolidated their powers through violent coups and the suppression of dissent
The same was true in the Philippines Taiwan Indonesia and Thailand and indeed in the Middle East where democracy is yet to take root
As long as the Cold War lasted US administrations consistently favored military strongmen and civilian dictators in the name of fighting Communism  anything to keep the left down even the kind of left that would have been regarded as simply liberal in the democratic West
True for most people life under rightwing Asian strongmen was on the whole preferable to life under Mao Pol Pot Kim Il Sung or even Ho Chi Minh
But to call the citizens under Park Chung Hee Ferdinand Marcos or General Suharto ree is an abomination
The happy fact that Koreans Filipinos Thais and Taiwanese did eventually become free or at least freer is not so much to the credit of the US as it is to the people who fought for their freedoms themselves
It was only in the late  when the Communist empire was crumbling that US governments actively backed democratic politicians and demonstrators in Seoul Taipei or Manila
But the heroes of democracy were Asian not American
Bush is right to claim that people in the Middle East would like to be as prosperous and free as the South Koreans but his notion that the war in Iraq is simply a continuation of US policies in Asia could not be more mistaken
In Asia as in the Middle East US strategy was to prop up dictators against Communism until their own people toppled them
In the Middle East today it is reckless and radical invading a country wrecking its institutions and expecting that freedom will grow in the ensuing state of anarchy
To confuse these different enterprises and pretend that they are the same is not only wrong but dangerous and deeply disappointing to those of us who still regard the US as a force for good
The Hollow Heart of Medical Science
Why are neuroscientists molecular biologists geneticists and developmental biologists  men and women whose discoveries have forever changed the way we understand ourselves  so uneasy about their futures
The crisis in morale among today medical scientists stems not from money problems nor from the stage of development of their fields nor from the level of research that is being conducted but from these scientists failure to form themselves into proper humane communities
Low morale results from too little kindness and decency it is a failure of custom and manners a loss of social purpose a diminution of the ability or the will to distinguish right from wrong and then to act rightly
At root low morale is just a consequence of the indifference of medical scientists busy in their labs allowing the social and emotional foundations of their field to rot away beneath them
The vulnerability of the sciences that focus on the human body and mind lies in the obligation all scientists have to observe their systems with dispassion
In these fields dispassion requires that the medical scientist ignore his or her own vulnerability of mind and body
The strain of trying to meet this impossible standard of cool curiosity about one own fate imposes an unbearable distance between the scientist of the body and mind and the body and mind of the scientist
Under this strain medical research scientists are susceptible to the dream that their instruments and procedures have somehow freed them from the limitations of their minds and bodies
The conscious expression of this dream is an obsessive response to the certainty of biological death the belief that a big enough win in the game of science will beat death itself by conferring a form of immortality on the winner
Nothing but the thinnest membrane of denial separates the notion of scientific immortality through priority of discovery from this deeper older and wholly nonscientific dream of escaping one own inevitable death
Though today biomedical science claims to search for repairs of nature defects too many of its practitioners behave as if their real purpose were only to gain the mythical immortality of precedence at whatever cost to themselves or others
Denial of the fear of mortality and projection of the suppressed wish to transcend nature are the marks of a masked effort to create a biomedical science at war with its own stated purposes
The problem is not that science and medicine wish to avoid finding cures it is that they are too strongly motivated by an irrational unconscious need to cure death to be fully motivated by the lesser task of preventing and curing disease in order to delay their patients  and their own  inevitable ends
The irrational obsessive promises made by scientists and physicians in the past few decades have in a way institutionalized the denial of death
But these promises are not sustainable
A humane version of the biomedical sciences would for instance acknowledge that it is not about to transcend the limits of the human body and so it would no longer make promises that it cannot keep
Beyond that a science that acknowledges an unconscious component in its operations if not in its methodology will best serve its practitioners as human beings as well as being most likely to generate lasting value for the rest of us
Such a change cannot happen unless scientists themselves first take the time to consider the consequences of their own behavior toward each other
We should begin our reforms in the most conservative way by rediscovering and rededicating ourselves to the meaning of the title we professors hold
o profess has a spectrum of meanings to affirm openly declare or claim to make a pretense of pretend to claim skill in or knowledge of to affirm belief in to receive into a religious order or congregation to make an open affirmation or to take the vows of a religious order or congregation
Rather than choose among all these current meanings we might begin by returning to the word from which they all evolved the Middle English rofessen to take vows
Professors do not deserve the title unless they are willing to take the time and make the effort to openly affirm something beyond their data
Affirmations and vows are not datadependent they are matters of the heart
To be a professor it seems to me one must first have something of importance to oneself that needs affirming and then one must affirm it
Morale among professors in science will remain low until they decide that their strongest feelings as well as their best data should determine professional behavior and professional status
The Hollow Heart of the West
BERLIN  It is tempting to compare NATO and the European Union to the French and Italian football teams in this year Euro  competition
What unites them above all is a process of ompetitive decadence
The EU and NATO may see themselves as potential rivals or complementary partners in the field of defense
But what their leaders say in private reveals a sense of common frustration
e fail to translate military presence into political influence says the NATO person who sounds very much like EU representatives commenting on the Union role in the Middle East
e have failed to transform economic aid into political influence they lament
The crises that the two institutions now face in the wake of Ireland vote against the Lisbon Treaty and the deterioration of security in Afghanistan are of course very different
Yet both are ultimately identity crises
Both NATO and the EU have been forced to redefine how they function and rethink their purposes after a dual process of enlargement
From that standpoint the challenge confronting NATO may be even more difficult for enlarging the security organization not only means taking on new members but also exercising new ut of area responsibilities
Moving from the North Atlantic to Afghanistan and from deterrence to combat has proved to be a major challenge for NATO  a test that may prove harder than the disappearance of the Soviet Union nearly  years ago
Can NATO survive defeat in Afghanistan
The question is far from abstract
The challenge posed by Afghanistan was underestimated from the start and the Alliance has underresourced it
The lack of a clear plan  is the goal to defeat Al Qaeda or to create democracy  remains problematic but less so in the short term than the lack of adequate resources
Indeed while Afghanistan is the size of France NATO has sent the same number of troops as it has in tiny Bosnia
The war in Iraq has not only caused NATO to lose focus in Afghanistan it has also undermined solidarity of purpose among allies
And without confronting much more seriously the anctuary role unwillingly played by Pakistan there is no solution ahead for NATO in Afghanistan
The other major problem facing NATO is linked to the United States loss of the moral high ground
In the artistic imagination of Europeans America has become associated more with servitude than with freedom
In the Berlin Opera latest version of Beethoven Fidelio the prisoners seemed to be coming out of Guantnamo
The Afghan quagmire and America image are not the only problems facing NATO
The organization has to redefine its purpose particularly its relationship with a resurgent Russia
NATO aim cannot simply be to use Lord Ismay famous formula o keep America in Russia out and Germany down
By losing its geographic focus NATO is now confronted with a major identity challenge
Is it to become a eague of democracy
If so it must consider having a special relationship with countries like India and Japan to name a few
If it is to remain a estern Alliance in a lobalized world must it define a much clearer relationship with Russia without giving the Kremlin a veto in the Alliance
Or will NATO eventually become an lliance for stability that includes all the new powers  China India and Brazil not to mention Russia  of the emerging ultipolar world
One thing is certain a hrinking West as long as it retains some influence must create the best institutions it can during the time it still has
In essence the EU fundamental dilemma is not that different from NATO
It has succeeded so well that it has taken on new members and new responsibilities but has lost focus and clarity of purpose
What is Europe project today
Where does the EU end
It no longer dreams of becoming the nited States of Europe and Jacques Delors suggestion of he United Nations of Europe has remained too ambivalent if not deliberately ambiguous to be effective
After the Irish o can the Union find salvation in NATO idea of a oalition of the willing
Can the most determined prointegration Europeans leave the pack without being paralyzed by the coalition of the unwilling
Of course the Irish o is not the equivalent for the EU of what the Afghan quagmire represents for NATO
Yet it also constitutes a major setback and challenge of an institutional political and even psychological nature
How do you recreate a European arrative that reconciles the Union with its citizens
The EU has lately failed  far more than NATO has  not only to win hearts but also to convince Europeans that in a global world it is part of the solution not part of the problem
The Honor of Exile
The Romanian sculptor Brancusi once said that when the artist is no longer a child he is dead
I still dont know how much of an artist I have become but I grasp what Brancusi was saying
I can grasp  even at my age  my childish enduring self
Writing is a childish profession even when it becomes excessively serious as children often are
My long road of immaturity began more than half a century ago
It was July  a few months after I returned from a concentration camp called Transnistria
I lived that paradisiacal summer in a little Moldavian town overwhelmed by the miraculous banality of a normal secure environment
The particular afternoon was perfect sunny and quiet the rooms semiobscurity hospitable
I was alone in the universe listening to a voice that was and wasnt mine
My partner was a book of Romanian fairy tales with a hard green cover which I had been given a few days before when I turned the solemn age of 
That is when the wonder of words the magic of literature started for me
Illness and therapy began at the same time
Soon too soon I wanted myself to be part of that family of word wizards those secret relatives of mine
It was a way of searching for something else beyond the triviality of everyday life and also of searching for my real self among the many individuals who inhabited me
I must confess that I also tried several times to get rid of that inner self to find a surrogate capable of representing me better on the social scene
I studied engineering not only because I wanted a profession that might protect me from the daily political demagogy but also because I hoped it would protect me from that essential self I had discovered on an unforgettable postwar July afternoon
Yet the need for something drastically different and higher than the framed daily routine of an engineer and a citizen of the socialist paradise did not diminish
In that doubled estrangement reading and writing proved to be again and again a saving disease
Finally I was able to hear my own voice in my own book which also had as it happened a green cover
In the worldcircus the poet looks like an Augustus the Fool illequipped for everyday life in which his fellow men offer and receive their share of edible reality
Yet his weakness may be seen as an unconventional and devious strength his solitude a deeper kind of solidarity his imagination a shortcut to reality
Inevitably in the bright public square Augustus the Fool the poet faces the Clown of Power
All human tragicomedy may be seen occasionally in this encounter in the history of Circus as History
Nonetheless the totalitarian experience remains incomparable in its pathology in its masks and mendacity
An artist who has lived under tyranny and even one who hasnt cannot ignore the barrier that separates the two roles
For a writer the exile par excellence  always a suspect as Thomas Mann said  language is his placenta
More than for any other alien in his country language is for a writer not only an achievement but a spiritual home
Through language he feels rich and stable and when he is fully in charge of his wealth he gains his citizenship a sense of belonging
Language is always home and homeland for a writer
To be exiled from this last refuge represents the most brutal decentering of his being a burning that reaches all the way to the core of creativity
I postponed the decision to leave Romania because I was childish enough to fool myself that I didnt live in a country that I lived only in a language
Eventually I took the language the home with me as a snail does
It still is my childish refuge my place of survival
Topics such as totalitarianism or exile may say a lot about my life and my writing but however important they dont in themselves tell about a piece of literature
Even in collective tragedies and extreme situations the writer is searching through his own vision strategy and style for the destiny of the individual for the human specificity of weakness and resilience and dreams for the ambiguities and limits and surprises of individuality caught in the social deadlock
I hope that even in the dark frame of such topics the light of the human soul and mind its contradictions and potential the ceaseless questions about love and death about commitment and cowardice about solitude and solidarity about the tragicomedy of humans reveal for better or worse the imprint of the author
I was in fact more preoccupied with the gray zone in which I saw a kind of rainbow zone of truth allowing me to search beyond undifferentiated darkness for individual features and thus to introduce in the apparent uniformity of the extreme situation unsettling nuances
As liberating as it was going from internal exile into exile itself was a no easy experience
I have learned however in the more than ten years that have passed since I felt that burning to honor exile doing so in the name of all that is challenge and epiphany of all the doubts and the lifelong apprenticeship it implies for its emptiness and richness for the unfettering of myself and the clash within myself
The stranger consciously or unconsciously is always a potential or partial exile and all real writers are perpetual exiles from this world even when like Proust they hardly leave their rooms
More and more exile is an emblem of our time
Everywhere people face the contradiction between centrifugal cosmopolitan modernity and the centripetal need or at least nostalgia for belonging
It is impossible to predict what place if any literature will have in the future
I dont dare to believe as Dostoevsky did that beauty can save our world
But we may hope that it can play a role in consoling and redeeming our loneliness
We may hope that its promise of beauty its challenge of truth its redefinition of goodness its unpredictable playfulness will be difficult to abandon even in uncertain and dangerous times
The artist remains no matter how childish it may seem a secret laborer of love
He daily reinvents the premises of the difficult search he honors his reader a stranger similar and dissimilar with the gift of an exacting love
Thus he can continue his neverending adventure and humanize his shipwreck wherever he may be
The Horn of Africa Last Famine
SEATTLE  The recent pledge of  million by African leaders and the international community to help the more than  million people facing starvation in the Horn of Africa underscores the need for continued attention and funding to prevent this tragedy from claiming and scarring even more lives
But while much more needs to be done to meet the immediate needs of this famine victims we should also be thinking now about longterm solutions to preclude food crises on this scale from happening in the first place
Many people see famines as forces of nature completely beyond our control
But famines are triggered by more than the weather
They are complicated events rooted in governance security markets education and infrastructure  all of which can be influenced
We have the tools to prevent food crises by making smart longterm investments in agriculture
Threequarters of the world poorest people get their food and income from farming small plots of land and most of these smallholder farmers are women
They have no margin for error so they need to increase their chances of producing a crop
When farmers can produce more and earn more income they become more resilient to shocks like severe weather and can put themselves and their families on a path to selfsufficiency
In  when global food prices skyrocketed famine swept across Ethiopia threatening more than  million people in the Horn of Africa
Oxfam America with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation organized a twostep response to the crisis
The first focused on  of Ethiopia most atrisk farmers and got them what they needed immediately food
The second step was to organize cashforwork projects that built dams rehabilitated springs and constructed roads thereby helping people to strengthen their small farms and improve their resilience to future droughts
When drought returned this year these investments paid off
Instead of needing food assistance many of the farm families were able to cope with the harsh weather and look forward to a harvest
This is not an isolated example
Thanks to the leadership of African countries that have made agricultural development a priority and to the tireless efforts of many international organizations real progress is being made against hunger and poverty on the continent
Ghana for example drastically reduced both poverty and hunger over the past  years by focusing on agricultural investments
The result today is a thriving agricultural sector which is growing at more than  a year and hunger levels that fell by  from 
Similarly Ethiopia has made strides towards shifting agricultural policies and investing more in productivity improvements for small farmers with increased spending helping to boost crop yields over the past several years
Heartier crop varieties are helping farmers to weather tough conditions
New droughttolerant maize varieties for example are already benefiting more than two million smallholder farmers in Africa
By  maize yields are expected to increase by as much as  benefiting up to  million people in  subSaharan countries
Other projects  including those supported by the United States Feed the Future program the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program and organizations such as the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa  are finding new ways to bolster the productivity of small farmers across the developing world
At a time of intense debate over budgets people around the world must remember that these kinds of investments not only save lives improve livelihoods and promote stability but also save money in the long run
Estimates show that emergency relief in famines costs seven times as much as preventing them
That is why it is more important than ever for international donors and African governments to continue to support programs that give small farmers access to the good seeds quality tools and reliable markets that they need to become selfsufficient
It is up to all of us to make sure this horrible famine is the last
The Hot Money Trap
SHANGHAI  The recent financial crisis has seen Asia emerge as an economic powerhouse  indeed as a key driver of global growth
Within five years or so Asia total economy could be as large as that of the United States and the European Union combined
Indeed while Asia is rising the rich industrial countries of the old G have been drifting into a liquidity trap
As the ongoing recession exhausts the traditional instruments of monetary policy central banks are opting for new rounds of quantitative easing QE
And with investors seeking higher returns more QE  especially by the US  will drive ot money shortterm portfolio flows into highyield emergingmarket economies which could inflate dangerous asset bubbles in Asia Latin America and elsewhere
The US Federal Reserve and the Obama administration remain rhetorically wedded to maintaining a trong dollar
But it is the dollar weakness that has boosted US corporate earnings since the crisis erupted propelling the Dow Jones Industrial Average above  for the first time since May
Since early  the dollar has fallen by onethird against major currencies and recently this decline has intensified
Since the end of August when Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke argued for another round of QE the dollar has plunged more than  against a basket of half a dozen major currencies
Inflationprotected securities are now being sold at negative yields for the first time ever
Following the midterm elections and the resurgence of the Republicans in the US Congress the Fed decision to pump  billion into the economy by mid is likely to trigger similar actions in the United Kingdom Japan and other advanced economies
Moreover the Fed has left the door open to more quantitative easing next year  a tacit acknowledgement that the recovery will be long and sluggish
But the effect of a new round of QE on interest rates could be small and limited to an announcement effect as the Fed own research indicates
In fact the full impact of America E will not be domestic because the net effect will be a weaker dollar as speculators bet on its decline
Successive waves of QE would amount to debasing the value of the dollar and thus inflating away massive US debts
Meanwhile developing countries are moving in the opposite direction
In October the People Bank of China responding to the twin threats of inflation and asset bubbles raised its oneyear deposit and lending rates by  basis points to  and  respectively  the first increases since 
In the West concerns about the impact on Chinese growth triggered a fearful selloff in the markets
Right before the Fed acted the Reserve Bank of India raised its benchmark shortterm interest rate by  basis points to  to fight inflation and China central bank now indicates that it might raise interest rates further
In Brazil interest rates remain close to 
After the Fed QE move Brazil is preparing to retaliate
t no use throwing dollars out of a helicopter as Brazilian Minister of Finance Guido Mantega put it
Soon afterward Germany finance minister called US policy lueless while his South African counterpart thought that the Feds move undermined the G leaders pirit of multilateral cooperation
Today a deepening global divide sets the slowgrowing US against many emergingmarket economies and commodityproducing countries
The worldwide impact of QE has only aggravated the chasm reflected by the rifts among the G nations
As the Fed exhausts the power of traditional monetary instruments it is heading into uncharted territory with the potential of unpredictable outcomes and unprecedented collateral damage
There is also the risk of a disruptive decline in the dollar which could prompt investors to flee US debt
In his famous  speech on the potential of deflation in America Bernanke suggested that Franklin Delano Roosevelt  devaluation of the dollar in  shows that exchangerate policy can be an ffective weapon against deflation
Today however global economic integration and interdependence are much deeper than in the 
As Chen Deming China Minister of Commerce recently complained he United States issuance of dollars is out of control and international commodity prices are continuing to rise
As a result hina is being attacked by imported inflation
The impact of the Fed policy and hot money has been dramatic
In the third quarter of this year Chi
